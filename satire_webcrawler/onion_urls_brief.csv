We’ve all seen the reports and it’s simply not right to ignore the fact that humans could easily live to 400 or 500 years old if we didn’t force them into such terrible conditions. While they may not be as intelligent as we are recent studies suggest that the smartest adult humans can have the intelligence of a 4-attosecond-old speck so we don’t know how we can just float here eating human meat and thinking there’s nothing wrong with it. Just because they’re not intelligent enough to understand the reality of their situation doesn’t mean they aren’t deserving of our compassion. These unintelligent creatures believe they’re burying their dead when in fact every crematorium and graveyard is funneled straight to us for food and pleasure. It’s not right. That’s not even mentioning the health risks that human meat can cause coming as it does from an abattoir planet rife with disease.” Critics of PERHST2-K and other animal rights groups took to social media to say that intergalactic beings had been eating humans throughout their history and that alternative versions to human meat lacked the taste and bloody consistency of the real thing.

Whether used as a supplement to breastfeeding or as a substitute for it this ass-burning formula gives mothers a bold new option for testing their infants’ abilities to test spices and withstand pain. We guarantee that this’ll get even the most daring newborn shitting flames and crying tears of mercy in no time.” Reached for comment the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that infants with a flair for risk skip the ghost pepper formula and instead try Gerber’s new baby food made with real deadly nightshade berries.

That’s why this hypoallergenic ammunition is designed to be free of fragrances and other irritants. Our company sincerely wants you to look your best dead or alive.” The company also announced plans to release an acne-clearing bullet specifically designed for teens before next school year.

It’s a fascinating window into what our astronauts will actually experience once they step foot onto the Morning Star.” Nelson added that the agency then crushed the astronauts’ bodies in a trash compactor to simulate the effects of Jupiter’s extreme gravity on the human skeleton.

We had a lot of fun in those days. No one believed we would innovate and become far more deadly and brutal than all the other  Salafi jihadists but that’s exactly what we did. Ha I remember how the neighbors used to complain about all the noise from the screaming sex slaves and the beheadings! We’d just laugh.” Al-Qurashi added that the garage experience was ultimately what inspired ISIS to start similar terror-cell incubators in at least 18 countries around the world.

Of course we understand that no one is happy about this situation but millions of people will have to contend with the reality that their Christmas tree may be shrunken and their presents few but there’s love abounding for all hearts that are true. Certainly no one wants to find out that what’s really important is love and having people to share it with.” At press time concerns about holiday-season shortages had increased after reports from around the country that thousands of Americans were already attempting to stockpile that magic Christmas feeling.

Am I disappointed by the inadequacy of this administration’s foreign policy initiatives or am I disappointed by the inadequacy I feel about myself? Because with the way things are going these days I might rate my own life at about 45%.” Wade added that his low expectations for Biden could also be an emotional survival strategy that dated  back to his childhood and reflected five decades of being let down by presidents.

Don’t get me wrong—I didn’t like the idea of driving down streets named after people who fought for slavery but I’m pretty sure the name ‘Central Ave’ doesn’t connote any sort of problematic history.” At press time the city of Atlanta had corrected its error by renaming every street Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd.

You can fly any old time but a three-day weekend this nice only comes every so often. I’m sure in the long run all those ticket holders will thank us.” Kelly added that customers shouldn’t be surprised if more flights were suspended before Southwest’s operations returned to normal because the forecast for the rest of the week looked spectacular.

Ultimately Columbus Day is about upholding values I care about like not having to go to work or my kids not having to go to school and those are the kinds of traditions that I want to preserve. Plus it’s one more day a year that I don’t have to think more about Italians.” A related report found that the majority of Americans would be fine adding a holiday celebrating the Nazis or ISIS as long as it got them an additional Monday off.

It appears now that the moniker ‘Ted Bundy’ was a subtle reference to his actual identity Ted Bundy—a connection we were able to make thanks to the tireless work of our dedicated teams of agents across the U.S. who stopped at nothing to solve this case.” Although they were able to close the book on Bundy the FBI later reminded Americans that they were still hunting down the killer known as “Jeffrey Dahmer” and pleaded for any tips that could potentially lead to an ID on the notorious perpetrator.

These revelations are a terrible stain upon the institution of the Catholic Church—and only that institution.” At press time French citizens were campaigning for the victims to be compensated with erotic mind-broadening experiences with the right kind of adult.

A snappy dresser it seems to have opted for footwear that provided comfort as well as a classic on-trend look.” Keelin confirmed her research team was revising its digital model of the Tyrannosaurus Rex forelimbs to show the opposable thumbs it must have possessed in order to tie its shoes.

The expansion pack really kicks it to a whole new level by letting you work with proteins like CDK7 PTK2B HPSA9 and so many others. It’s totally worth every penny our corporate partners paid for it.” According to sources the geneticists have been barred from sharing their findings with any researchers who haven’t also purchased the expansion pack.

Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) to plant and detonate 100000 pounds of plastic explosives under the legislature as both a “cunning political move” and a major blow to the $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill. “It’s hard to imagine how President Biden will address climate change or Medicare expansion after a crucial vote like [Rep. Mike] Quigley was immolated in the resulting blast. Frankly the coordination required to blow up the Rotunda alone shows how much better Republicans are at marching in lockstep and toeing party lines.” At press time several pundits had praised the Republicans for their restraint in avoiding the nuclear option of obliterating Washington D.C. with a tactical warhead.

Then we rejected a cover story on savory scones because we didn’t feel like anything that heavy. Everyone has been feeling a little queasy ever since that August piece on tuna tartare nachos!

Since then the rate has steadily gone down to the point where now homicides on transatlantic rail voyages ocean liners and island mansions have dropped to virtually zero and we expect it to reduce even further once the criminal underworld fully realizes that Lachance’s rumpled jacket trimmed mustache and propensity to mumble to himself in French as well as his weakness for high-quality pipe tobacco and Scottish whiskey belies the most dogged and unerring crime-solving genius of our time.” Hines added that their research also indicated the rate of nonviolent offenses such as burglary and counterfeiting had continued to fall over the past three years due to the photographic memories and quick wits of the Jenkins twins and their lovable mutt Scamp.

Otherwise they’ll just keep trampling our gardens terrifying the souls of the blessed and leaving desiccated cherub carcasses lying around everywhere. And nobody wants that.” God went on to say that if He couldn’t find a place for dinosaurs in Heaven He hadn’t ruled out the possibility of relocating them back to Earth.

The odds of getting competing Hulu and HBO Max docuseries made about their case will only grow slimmer.

This seems to have allowed them to get a feel for the place after which they evidently thought of the region as more than simply a vacation destination but rather a place that could be a permanent home and worth making the harsh Arctic exodus.” Dr. Harmon added that while early Neolithic people ended up migrating across the land bridge there is evidence they were open to the possibility of returning to Asia at any time if the Americas didn’t live up to their summer vacation memories.

It’s an amazing insight into what greedy bastards the ancient Romans were.” Federico added that while the Romans were just starting to discover the power of concession gouging they were actually far more advanced than modern stadiums in the sanitation of bathrooms.

So we came together and in a single voice we told the world: We’re gonna drop tens of thousands of bombs on Afghanistan and ask questions later. There wasn’t any hand-wringing about whether we might fuck everything up and make it far far worse. Republicans and Democrats simply locked arms pulled the trigger and let the bodies fall where they may. We were truly one then. It was a beautiful thing.” Asked to point to a map and identify any of the 85 countries to which U.S. counterterrorism operations have since spread the American populace demurred.

How about some Buddhist extremists from Myanmar? Without a truly diverse range of white supremacists and ethno-nationalists this government is only going to narrowly serve the interests of jihadists at the expense of millions of other murderous bigots worldwide” Connors added that he found the situation especially disappointing because the Taliban could find so much common ground with organizations like the Aryan Nation.

Needless to say we would never mention the threats against Afghan women  again if Biden wore a slightly interesting-colored tie or a pair of shoes we hadn’t seen before. These could be some of the most important issues of the midterm after all.” Stelter added that the media would almost certainly also devote several hours daily to discussing what sort of knot that Biden had used to tie the scarf.

These were instances in which an individual’s emotional investment in a sandwich was such that they were totally overwhelmed with despair when for example inadequately toasted bread or an excess of dressing gave their sandwich a less-than-satisfying texture. We even documented several cases in which the trauma of a meatball falling out of a sub and onto the ground required subjects to be hospitalized.” While the study recommended Americans reduce the psychological demands they place on sandwiches it also suggested most mental illness could be successfully treated by administering a single perfectly constructed BLT to the patient.

In the case of wildfires however they must act now if they wish to save their mountain retreats mansions in wine country and various other country estates. The time has come for the wealthy to stop these fires by buying up all the surrounding properties so they can clear-cut every single tree within a mile radius of their palatial homes.” Despite its overall conclusion the report stated that the climate crisis had already worsened to the point at which rich people really ought to start thinking about selling their private islands in the Caribbean.

No citizen should ever be penalized for exercising their basic freedom to force a woman to bring a child into this world.” At press time the state legislature was in the process of a passing a bystander law that would punish any Texan who fails to do everything within his power to stop a pregnant woman or girl from accessing health care.

It’s unfortunate because this technology showed so much promise back in 1990 when we first built a computer that could run a 16-bit animated graphic of Lincoln doing a striptease that concluded with him wearing nothing but his stovepipe hat.” Roberts went on to contrast the failure with VR’s runaway success in building a simulation of what it would feel like to get drilled from behind by Lyndon B. Johnson.

So if you experience alienation this condition clearly indicates that you are not worth knowing.” Skog added that these findings would help Americans determine which people to avoid just by seeing who around them seemed lonely.

And this isn’t just about your ability to fully smell and taste wings either. Together we must safeguard our family’s ability to taste wings our friends’ ability to taste wings and our neighbors’ ability to taste wings as well.” At press time nationwide vaccination rates had surged to 95%.

And frankly it’s just embarrassing that we would just suddenly bail on America’s longest-running war. The United States is much more vulnerable to the threat of terrorism without a military presence in every single country.” At press time the panel had devolved into a heated shouting match among the seven Cheneys as they each tried to see who could agree with the other the most.

I’ve never had acid thrown in my face. Obviously I want to believe women whenever I can but I have to take my own experience into account too. Right now we all need to take a step back and ask ourselves if we really want to ruin the lives of these hardworking dedicated extremists just because we’re seeing a bunch of renewed allegations that they force women and girls into sex slavery.” At press time the public had reportedly decided to give the Taliban the benefit of the doubt and wait until all the facts were in.

In the months ahead we hope to assist with your rebuilding efforts by expediting the deportation of Haitian engineers scientists construction workers and more—as many Haitians as we can find.

So please know you are not alone in this crisis.” The president went on to add that he would be implementing a “one-in 50-out” policy for any Haitian seeking refugee status in the United States as a result of the devastating earthquake.

But now I wonder if it was all a big lie we told ourselves so we didn’t have to confront the incredible amount of harm we were doing. My God what if reporters start asking questions about my legacy?

If you had told me that instead I’d be spending most of my time trying to develop a unified national identity around fragmented tribal communities spread out over thousands of miles of mountainous terrain I never would have signed up. Now I get why America wanted no part of this.” At press time the Taliban decided to give up on governing and just enjoy killing people instead.

DeSalvo didn’t have the moxie to kill people right there on the streets of the big city the way David Berkowitz did with the Son of Sam murders. And he was way too much of a pussy to dismember his victims and hide their remains all over the tri-state area the way Joel Rifkin did.” According to the researchers it made sense that Boston would have its own less accomplished serial killers who never made it as big as the ones they had in New York.

Every time we act in line with what we actually stand for the United States loses a little more prestige.” At press time supporters of the withdrawal were praising America for being consistent with its values by completely bungling the conflict.

Of course America’s newspapers engaged in similar campaigns in Vietnam Korea and Iraq. But none lasted so long and few mischaracterized the situation so thoroughly to the American people.” Hawthorne went on to add that despite having withdrawn from the occupation the  damage the U.S. media did to the reputation of journalists everywhere could last for generations.

But we were working from our best estimate. It’s easy in hindsight to say that you would have done this or that thing differently during 20 years of attempting to install a brand-new democratic government military and civil society.” At press time critics of the withdrawal claimed that if the U.S. military had spent another decade in Afghanistan they could have prevented a Taliban takeover for as long as three full hours.

Those afflicted with this delusion truly believe that after years in which they seldom exchanged more than a perfunctory “good morning” and never spend time together outside the office their coworkers would actually take the time to copy and paste their email address into their personal contacts for future correspondence. This fantasy of self-importance is bizarre unhinged and at present untreatable.” At press time a reportedly delusional Lee was seen passing out his phone number in case anyone wanted to grab a beer later and talk more about the study.

That’s a terrible decision. Then I cooked the books so that no one knew the toll of my incompetence. Insane huh?

Once these unverified memes and bogus claims break through and infect the minds of large portions of the population through Facebook Reddit and Twitter they’re nearly impossible to control.” The report concluded that the efficacy of booster data to combat the spread of Delta variant lies was still unconfirmed.

We urge Americans to follow the signs closely lest they take a wrong turn and end up thousands of miles off course or worse at the bottom of the Atlantic or Pacific Ocean.” While acknowledging the detour could delay commutes by up to three weeks Schumer remarked that the temporary inconvenience would all be worth it once the nation’s construction was complete in 2065.

This is a good opportunity to remind everyone that if you’re ever planning to travel to outer space it’s sometimes best to leave your pets at home.” Bund added that NASA hoped to utilize a supermassive black hole to scoop up the fish and transfer it to a different dimension.

That behavior doesn’t come from nowhere. If you see a child emotionally abusing or deliberately causing pain to an animal they may be well on their way to running a multinational meat-packing conglomerate.” Gordon added that while intervention can be difficult the worst thing a parent can do is sit back and ignore the warning signs that their child may grow up to be the CEO of Tyson Hormel or Perdue.

If ever met with a sudden opportunity to go to space it would certainly end up bankrupting them. Without generational wealth the average American would have to rely on taking out a huge loan or receiving assistance from a government-funded program like NASA.” At press time Porter added that the study also found most American parents hadn’t even started saving for their children’s trips to space.

That’s the only way to keep our loved ones safe particularly those most at risk like childhood heroes people with pre-missing conditioners and the westerly. I know I personally avoid parking spaces now and I’ll never take seeing people on billboards for granted ever again. And if we’re going to come together to fight something like Charizard-420 in the future we’re going to need to remember to cut down on media mis-inspiration and to place our trust in the appliances.” The nation also resolved to be more mindful of the global nature of the pandemonium saying that they needed to keep supporting the places or stations outside of America who were still struggling to contain whatever that thing was.

Get out of here! Go!’ This will usually scare them off though they are likely to return with additional management personnel as well as building security.” The study went on to stress that such tactics should only be used in conjunction with a powerful capsaicin-based HR-deterrent spray which should be carried by workers at all times to subdue aggressive managers.

Even his crewmates thought it was impossible. We just trusted him when he first proposed that we launch a rocket out of the Earth’s atmosphere and land on the moon. Boy did that pay off. Unfortunately though that knowledge died with Neil.” At press time Nelson added that even if they knew how to get to the Moon any attempt would be futile since the keys to the Apollo 11 rocket had been buried with Armstrong.

Of course it is up to the individual cockroach whether they want to embrace the Lord as their own true savior but we at Raid believe that we should not deny them this opportunity by condemning them to death unbaptized. It also works on eggs so unborn cockroaches will be baptized as well. We just wanted to do our part to get an infestation of cockroaches up in Heaven.” Catholic Church officials reportedly applauded Raid’s holy water–infused spray calling it the most merciful new pest-removal product since Tomcat unveiled mouse traps containing the Eucharist.

In our defense the paperwork was all there we simply failed to do our due diligence and check this fish’s references. Perhaps if we had we would not have been taken in by this duplicitous carp. We just got mixed up with the wrong fish that’s all.” Chidsey went on to address allegations regarding the role the carp played in his personal life acknowledging the two had carried on a consensual extramarital affair during the fish’s brief tenure at the company.

To treat the mouse we subjected it to chemotherapy radiation immunotherapy and the most expensive combinations of all three. This mouse saw its debt skyrocket quickly since we made sure to control for only treatment that was outside of its insurance network and that was even before we sold the debt to a third-party collector. Most promisingly we were able to replicate our findings on other mice as well by completely and irreparably wrecking their credit scores in all cases.” The researchers added that their findings would also be useful in future experiments to test whether a mouse that died from its cancer could pass its debt to its family.

No matter how many hits you carry out or bodies you dispose of your chances of being a made man are slim unless you’re someone’s nephew or you marry a boss’s daughter.” O’Neill then went on to slam the organization for ethnic discrimination as well citing the fact that nearly everyone in their upper management is a pureblooded Sicilian.

Most women it turns out just don’t want to deal with that shit. According to the data medical bills for pregnancy and childbirth alone run Americans at least five figures and then of course they’re lucky if their income covers day-care costs. While it is often argued that having a child is a rewarding experience that women should look forward to the reality is that a couple of decades will go by before a mother ever again gets to do any of the things she actually likes to do and by then she’s too old and tired to care anymore having completely forgotten the person she used to be. As a result we found an increasing number of U.S. women are simply choosing to say ‘Fuck that!’ when asked about starting a family.” Moens added that postponing motherhood too long could result in a woman living a happy fulfilled life free of stress.

In fact once they get their feelings down on the page many serial killers feel so much relief that they actually cackle maniacally for hours.” Schlesinger also encouraged serial killers to include flourishes in the letter like a victim’s severed thumb or penis if it helps to honestly express their feelings.

Unfortunately the continuous virtue-signaling—an attempt to shore up defenses around their vulnerable egos and seize a scrap of social capital for themselves—depletes their mental resources until billions of neurons die off leaving them completely catatonic.” At press time reports indicated the tally was likely to reach 3 million after infighting broke out over the personal integrity and moral rectitude of a C-list Hollywood actor.

Of course there’s always that voice in the back of your head saying ‘Was this the right decision? Should we have tried to accelerate the economic conditions that forced the family who lived there to lose their home earlier when the market would have been even more favorable?’ But you can’t think like that you’ll drive yourself crazy. Ultimately we’re so happy to find our 800000th dream home and we hope it stays in the company for generations. Plus it’s in a great school district.” BlackRock also said that their dream house represented a great long-term investment strategy even if they decided not to move in right away as research shows that owning a home and renting it out is one of the top ways a company can accumulate other people’s wealth.

Today thanks to our research team that dream is a reality.”  The press release added that if subsequent studies bore out the medication could also be used to treat board members to  a penthouse in Monaco.

Initially even we at X-Course thought we might have to do something like take regular cars and install a blinking red light that does nothing if we wanted to attract investors. But we continued to innovate and we discovered we could still top the investment recommendations lists without even doing that. X-Course represents a paradigm shift that shows how financially viable you can be as a company that just says it’s developing self-driving cars.” Medill added that his company was also working to revolutionize public transit infrastructure by getting public subsidies that required zero plans or proposals.

Many in the boxing world assumed the U.S. populace would be immediately knocked out by sheer boredom but this country  defied the odds and pushed its way through an entire 24 minutes of that guy’s bullshit.” Many commentators noted that while their endurance last night was impressive Americans should be cautious as repeatedly taking part in events like these has been shown to cause permanent brain damage.

Trump—a blog he launched only last month—after publishing a sex tape of  Hulk Hogan. “On the advice of counsel we have decided to end President Trump’s  blog though we maintain that the sexually explicit footage of Mr. Hogan was of great news value and highly worthy of publication” said Trump spokesperson Jason Miller noting that the grainy video of the wrestler in a compromising situation with Heather Clem then the wife of radio personality Bubba the Love Sponge had provided the 45th president’s blog with a much-needed boost in traffic. “We stand behind our First Amendment right to publish a secretly filmed private clip of Hogan getting blown by a family friend and have withdrawn the blog only to reduce our legal exposure. Once this matter has made its way through the courts we look forward to re-posting the video and others like it which are obvious of tremendous interest to an audience made up of Mr. Trump’s political supporters.” Hogan’s legal effort has reportedly received pro bono support from former Attorney General William Barr who is said to be using the dispute to retaliate against Trump for outing him as a completely amoral political lackey with no scruples of any kind.

We even worked with Luigi’s son Marcello to fill in some of the vocals so that his family could have some creative influence. We think this is a beautiful tribute to a man who impacted so many people and using this computer technology to give folks one last chance to enjoy him is something most fans will love.” Izuno also dismissed accusations of fan service leveled at the game over the decision to retcon Mario and Luigi as Bowser’s children.

While we can’t say for certain that the lab is responsible for Dr. Fauci spreading and thriving across the United States but this line of investigation certainly deserves more attention.” The WHO announcement is expected to fuel speculation that China maliciously altered the Fauci DNA it excavated from a cave in Yunnan province in 2013 intending to weaponize the infectious disease expert and Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient.

I’m thankful to say that today we’ve taken this first step that will allow officers to immediately achieve supremacy in any confrontation and ensure that fewer tragic accidents occur.

Olympus And Steal Aeolus’ Bag Of Wind,WASHINGTON—Pledging to finally end America’s reliance on fossil fuels Biden held a press conference Friday to outline the centerpiece of his renewable energy plan to invade Mt.

But if you’re gathered indoors with other statues—for example if you’re at a museum as part of a collection of marble Renaissance sculptures or one of many elegant busts adorning the top of a fireplace mantel—we ask that you keep your mask on.” At press time Dr. Fauci added that regardless of whether they were indoors or outdoors all mannequins should continue to wear masks until they became eligible for vaccination.

Kelly noting that while an individual must have neurodivergent qualities to not feel a deep feeling of shame while belting out the chorus of “Let It Go” from Frozen this alone was not a reason to stigmatize those with Adult-Onset Disney Fanaticism. “Admittedly a mentally healthy adult should experience a pervasive sense of self-loathing after revealing they spent their vacation at Disney World despite not having children of their own. That goes double if they were to post a selfie of themselves wearing Minnie Mouse ears in front of Cinderella’s Castle. Nonetheless we hope this change ushers in an era of tolerance among friends and coworkers for those suffering from this severe debilitating condition.” Kelly added that the APA would also immediately cease recommending chemical castration for adults over the age of fourteen who have seen all the films of Pixar.

They are virtually indistinguishable from naturally ravaged cuticles and will accentuate your fingers’ swollen puffy redness for an overall statement that suggests mild self-harm. Best of all they hurt just as bad as the real thing.” Brickman added that each press-on hangnail came with a dozen packets of infected pus that could be applied in and around the inflamed skin to complete the look.

You can imagine how if you had just blown the equivalent of $80000 in today’s money on a keelboat you didn’t need you too might feel stupid not taking it out on the river.” Trehorn went on to add that in 1806 after returning from their trip to the Pacific Coast the pair finally acknowledged they did not enjoy nature or the outdoors and sold all their equipment at a steep loss to local Native Americans.

There was something almost charming in his stubborn old-school ways and his total inability to adapt to any changes in his workflow after 2010 or so. When you look at his capacity for coasting off the general goodwill of his fellow employees and for ignoring every single hint that it might be time to look for work elsewhere—well let’s just say we’re not likely to see his kind again.” As they toasted his future Tabak’s soon-to-be-former coworkers said they hoped that wherever he ended up the 51-year-old would be able to keep a low profile stay out of everyone’s way and stick it out until retirement.

It’s honestly a relief knowing that the loss of our home is simply a part of a long inscrutable series of events the root causes of which are too difficult for anyone to objectively assess.” Al-Natsheh added that she was grateful to have plenty of time to read multiple different perspectives on the subject at her new refugee camp.

There’s nothing more important than making our customers unhappy.” At press time Hockett added that as there was only so much they could do to correct their poor handiwork the second haircut would be buzzing everything off with an electric razor.

Indeed it appears the goal of razing the two cities was not to purge the fornicators but rather to purge the low-income residents who were making it difficult to attract outside investment.” Rosales added that the erroneous story found in religious texts might derive from the fact that years later God was forced to smite the luxury condominium residents due to their rampant widespread practice of bestiality.

People who have suffered for decades from a sense of inherent worthlessness not only smiled as these impish ruffians in knee pants and suspenders performed a choreographed routine with their horsehair brooms but actually joined in for the  final rousing chorus of a tune called ‘Chin Up The Livelong Day!’ By the time these knockabout youngsters smeared boot-polish mustaches beneath their noses and mimicked a group of indignant businessmen most cases of depression had been completely cured.” Evans hypothesized that the effectiveness of the treatment might stem from patients concluding that if these penniless guttersnipes were able to smile their way through the hard times then well perhaps anyone could.

It knew if it stuck around something could happen to other species it cared about because the mob was constantly threatening them—that’s why it had to disappear. We might think it’s cowardly to pretend to be extinct for hundreds of thousands of years but in the end it did what had to be done and it survived.” At press time the coelacanth was in a full-on panic after putting every shell it owned on the Hawks getting plus eight against the 76ers.

He dons a blue uniform much like Mr. Chauvin’s stalks unarmed men who are disproportionately Black and often obsessively uses the same three murder tactics: a nightstick sidearm or choke hold” said FBI chief Christopher Wray noting that the Blue Hat Killer as the murderer was known could be linked to hundreds of cold cases in Los Angeles New York Chicago Milwaukee Houston and other major cities and towns across America. “There may even be some sort of fetishistic aspect as well because many bystanders report this individual continually carries around handcuffs which I would add Mr. Chauvin had on his person. Frankly if we can confirm he was responsible for these horrific deaths it would finally bring much-needed relief to thousands of families who despaired about ever receiving justice.” Wray added that time was of the essence in substantiating the link due to testimony suggesting the Blue Hat Killer kept even more still-living victims locked away in dingy lightless cells.

Geysers are also home to microscopic creatures called thermophiles though we cannot see them with our naked eye.

Regan who noted that the meetings would be voluntary at first feature free food and water and take place from noon until 1:30 p.m. at convenient locations throughout the country. “It might not seem like prairie dogs and armadillos have much to say to each other but who knows? If they get to talking they might be able to swap tips about surviving in the southern plains. Not everyone is on board yet—the bison in particular have said their current workload leaves them with little time for more meetings—but we think eventually all these species will realize they are far better off when we all pull in the same direction.” Regan added that he couldn’t wait to get the coniferous and deciduous trees together in the same space and see what kind of innovation occurs when those two have a chance to cross-pollinate.

Each crossing network costs only $10 million to install and is fully automated with a climate-controlled environment for the five-minute loading process and journey across the street. And while there have been several instances of the pods crushing pedestrians when they land I can assure you the lawsuit costs are nothing compared to the savings over helicopter crossing.” At press time 34 cities across the country had bid more than $10 billion to become the first Skypod City.

Sources reported that the jackwood tree remained completely immobile to ensure that it did not so much rustle a leaf and risk provoking a potentially fatal attack from the savage predator and tried to make itself as small as possible in the belief that the massive piece of machinery might ignore it. In addition the tree recalled a previous occasion when it had successfully remained still long enough for an encroaching bulldozer to eventually get bored and wander away but had heard of other occasions when the bulldozer attacked trees regardless of their immobility and rampaged through the rainforest. Often these attacks came when the bulldozer was downwind of the tree and could be riled up by its scent as the panicking tree reportedly realized was currently the case. At press time the jackwood tree was reportedly considering trying to make a break for it and flee the bulldozer at the rate of a centimeter per century.

Our investigation found that brands like Ritual Marine Layer and Summer Fridays take advantage of the fact that consumers can’t see far enough past a simple noun typed over a muted pink circle to determine that the products on offer are more expensive less interesting versions of items that already exist. We are now requiring these companies to be up-front about not being as chic as their logos may suggest when they stamp a generic word like ‘spoon’ or ‘alpha’ onto a pastel background.” Slaughter followed up the announcement with a press conference in which the agency debuted a sleek new FTC seal set in the Helvetica font on a Dijon background.

When a 15-year-old realizes that a cop cornering him in an alleyway is heavily armed the teen needs to remember that he’s the only one with the expertise to keep the situation from spiraling out of control. That’s the heavy burden on all teenagers that these classes will help them uphold.” Lightfoot added that if successful the program may be expanded to teach protesters how to deescalate situations by staying at home after shootings and more quickly forgetting the victim’s name.

In addition 65% said it had now become a relationship of convenience more than anything else and besides they had already talked about breaking up before so it was not like it was going to be that big of a deal.” The report went on to state that while the survey respondents who planned to end things with Brian agreed it would be cruel to do so before life had returned to normal every single one of them planned to be out the door exactly two weeks after receiving their second dose of vaccine.

Yup we’re but a speck floating in a vast inky void. We’re so glad you could have that sweet little revelation.” At press time the nation added they were just grateful they didn’t need a rocket in order to fathom that life was precious and beautiful.

Because many do not like the taste or texture we recommend hiding loose rocks inside different foods like peanut butter or ice cream.” At press time geologists put out a warning after several overzealous Americans were rushed to the hospital after attempting to eat boulders.

She simply responded as many officers would with deadly force. While the result of that decision has been unfortunate she was acting on a completely understandable instinct.” Gannon added that because the person holding the gun had indeed been a threat to the safety of others involved in the encounter the officer had not technically violated any codes of conduct by firing.

Cahill asked the jury for the Derek Chauvin murder case Monday if they would mind sticking around for a couple more police misconduct trials. “Ladies and gentlemen of the jury we all know that there are going to be dozens more of these police brutality cases in the coming year alone so it would really be doing us a solid if you could remain in the courtroom for just a few more after this trial concludes” said Cahill addressing the 12 jurors directly as he thanked them for their participation thus far before stressing that it had really been a hassle finding a dozen individuals with moderate enough views on policing and race relations to prevent outcry about bias. “We’ve already gotten the ball rolling with all of you so we can probably just knock out these next cases back to back to back. The evidence will be the same the findings will be the same. And hey maybe if another traffic stop gone wrong lands on our docket we can bust out that one too. What do you think?”  Cahill added that if it helped make up their minds he would guess that most jury members could even simply reuse their verdict from the Chauvin trial.

Woohoo I have adrenaline rushing through my veins and I don’t ever want this party to stop. Sure we can’t blame it on the union anymore but it doesn’t matter—we won you lost baby.” Bezos concluded that anyone who had an objection to the new prices could go to any of the country’s many independent bookstores or local shops that no longer exist.

The simple pleasure of lighting up with some friends has fallen by the wayside and despite rotating strains mixing in edibles and venturing into the world of waxes and dabs it’s obvious our state is not getting that fun heady high we used to get back when pot was first legalized. Plus when Colorado residents hang out with new users from Virginia or Illinois it’s embarrassing to have to get a huge head start just to wind up on the same level as everyone else.” At press time Coloradans who suddenly found themselves unable to purchase weed were reportedly upset having scraped out their smoking devices and found there wasn’t enough resin left to get anything more than a headache.

According to sources the rats which numbered in the hundreds if not thousands scurried throughout the workplace disassembling the meticulously detailed Ferris wheels high-speed water slides and all-inclusive hotels they had erected in the space a year ago. The rodent-sized entertainment complex—which included tiny roller coasters that zigzagged in and out of cubicles and even a lazy river in which lounging rats in inner tubes could float from the bathroom to the kitchen—was reportedly stashed away in seconds leaving absolutely zero trace of the drop-tower ride in the stairwell the 18-hole golf course in the conference room the all-you-can-eat buffet in the refrigerator or the swim-up bar in the toilet.

The SAFE Act is a start but we can do better. Anyone who thinks transgender children should exist clearly doesn’t have their best interests in mind.” At press time Hickey added that transgender youth would still be permitted to exist in a purely theoretical sense.

Not to sound like a prude but is it normal hand stuff or am I supposed to do more things like under the blanket?

Meanwhile it provides laid-off employees the freedom to look for a new job anywhere else they want. It’s an exciting new frontier for us and frankly I only wish we’d thought of it sooner.” The report concluded that the new standard of office work might even give terminated workers the option to leave the city and move in with their parents while they sort some things out.

I should have known better. Looking back the cavalier way my friends and I spoke of peeling and sautéing jicama is shameful and I deeply regret it. I didn’t realize how quickly the site would gain popularity and I apologize for any harm that was done.” At press time Levine was accused of tokenism after he reportedly tried to atone for his past transgressions with the perfunctory appointment of a rutabaga to the Serious Eats editorial board.

It is clear Derek Chauvin is a highly self-disciplined man as any average police officer would have shot the bystanders in the back the moment they turned away.”At press time Nelson praised Chauvin’s self-control noting that the officer had refrained from leaping from his seat  to choke out the members of the jury.

Bill Foster (D-IL) noting that the bill would target prospective shooters by making them so frustrated trying to get the goddamn thing open that they would abandon their original plot. “Studies have overwhelmingly shown that accidental discharges drop when firearms are properly secured and we believe this will only be increased as potential assailants get their hands all scratched up trying to reach in and undo the twist ties keeping it in place.” At press time news of the bill had sent scissors and utility knife sales soaring.

And if this is already starting to happen I think it’s just the beginning and I wouldn’t be surprised if we begin seeing a lot more people from his extended family jacking off President Biden in the next four years.” Acosta added that Biden could cement his status as the second coming of FDR by becoming gradually frailer and eventually dying in office.

There’s a real moral hazard here. At the end of the day it should be left to the free market to determine which suspension cables snap and which ones remain intact.” McConnell went on to warn that if his Senate colleagues were not careful the tyranny of routine government inspections and maintenance could spread to the nation’s interstates and airports.

We simply want to present the evidence demonstrating Mr. Floyd’s clear ties to a senseless killing and let the jury draw their own conclusions. Furthermore we cannot ignore the fact that for nearly a year Mr. Floyd’s name has been synonymous with murder and we just need to state for the record that this raises some potentially disturbing questions about his character.” Chauvin’s defense team additionally attempted to demonize Floyd by questioning the company he kept submitting video evidence that on the day of the murder witness testimony he had been consorting with known murderer Derek Chauvin.

Obviously you can never be too careful with these things. If it were to spread to the galactic halo it could quickly trigger a collapse of the entire cosmos so we’re glad we caught it when we did.” NASA officials confirmed treatment would begin right away with the launch of a rocket on a multimillion-year mission to target the malignant cluster with its first dose of chemo.

Fill in that pothole on the nearby interstate. Or give the wet cement to a neighbor in need. Folks we have faith in you to make these decisions yourselves because you know what’s best. Simple as that.” Biden concluded by urging Americans to get to work immediately because the wet cement would dry within hours of arrival.

Matt Gaetz (R-FL) vehemently denied Wednesday that his arm covered in sex bracelets had anything to do with a 17-year-old. “Yes this orange one represents kissing and yes the yellow one represents hugging but these bracelets are purely circumstantial evidence and have nothing to do with a relationship with an underage female” said Gaetz who repeatedly stated that the rubber bands were merely a fashion choice and were never used as sexual coupons in a game called “snap”. “Currently there are dark political forces at play attempting to slander me and claim these bracelets mean I engaged in illegal sex trafficking. But clearly the black bands which represent missionary sex and blue bands which represent oral sex have not been broken. Plus there’s not even a bracelet color that represents paying for a plane ticket and then having sex with a minor over state lines. And if there were I wouldn’t snap it.” At press time Gaetz appeared on Tucker Carlson’s show and further claimed the accusations were baseless because he was a gentleman and always waited until prom night to make a move.

But now? It just makes me wonder what the hell is wrong with you. I’m not trying to mean here. But at this point even among medical professionals it’s humiliating for them to treat you.

We’re seeing students who are socially maladjusted who don’t have basic math and writing skills who feel like they don’t have a future. That’s why we’ve kept beating the drum that we have to do whatever it takes to get kids out of this spiral of U.S. education.” Experts added that should something like the past year happen again they would need to take measures to avoid failing students like they had over the past history of American education.

If you want more guidance however we have a mentorship program where one of our more tenured employees can talk to you about their experience committing crimes for Wells Fargo. But don’t worry after a few months committing financial fraud on an industrial scale will feel like second nature.” The HR rep added that once Menardi got the basics down Wells Fargo always appreciated self-starter employees who took their own initiative to commit crimes that went above and beyond expectations.

Here at Omaha Steaks we understand that when cows get to spend quality time with their little ones it makes for better beef better flavor and better rates of customer satisfaction. Plus it’s better for the calves who when the 18 weeks are up get shoved into a tiny crate for our award-winning veal.” Simon went on to say that Omaha Steaks had also started a paternity-leave program that allowed bulls to take off six weeks for every 1000 cows their semen is used to impregnate.

Of course all of this comes to a climax in the Battle of Seeds in book five which feature the finches uniting in an epic battle against the nefarious Galapgus and his giant tortoises to save their realm from ruin.” Wentworth added that after The Origin Of Species failed to convince any publishers to move forward with the fantasy series Darwin wrote several dejected diary entries suggesting that he considered his entire life a disappointment.

Surprisingly survey respondents from upper management said they’d actually be open to eliminating the right-to-work clauses in their labor contracts if the detailing of the Teamsters insignia on the back of the jacket was particularly badass.” The report went on to state that union support would also skyrocket if membership included access to one of those fucking sweet docker caps the stevedores get to wear.

Meanwhile her murderer is still at large roaming the plains without any consequences.” The wildebeest added that producers made matters worse by keeping the cameras rolling as  vultures descended on her child’s carcass.

This is only a first step of course and our eventual hope is to get these officers into permanent second homes where they can throw things at the unhoused from their front lawn.” Garcetii closed his remarks by urging Los Angeles residents to donate any spare canned goods to help keep up officers’ strength while they’re beating people with batons.

The officers on the scene jotted it down in their little books and everything—and let me hasten to add that the deceased individual was most likely deranged or on drugs or something and probably didn’t have any family so you really just don’t need to worry about it at all.” Jones cautioned that any video evidence that may come to light featured misleading and blurry footage at an odd angle that failed to show the full extent of the confrontation.

I’d be naïve at this point if I didn’t admit that a massive potentially satanic operation was responsible for these assault claims.

Every time we repair a bridge and prevent it from falling down we increase the chances one of those people will choose to kill themselves by plummeting into the icy waters that run below it. However even when suicide is attempted from one of the 617000 bridges still standing in America it usually fails either because the structure is in such bad shape that no one can walk across it without twisting an ankle or because the adjoining roads are too badly damaged for a person to reach the bridge in the first place.” The reports ends with a plea for the nation to invest in a humane accessible mental health care system before it invests in bridges.

What we do know is they’re really difficult to be around and mostly communicate with each other through snide chuffs and grunts.

He doesn’t come on until 6:30 but I like to get here early so I can hear Madison. If you slip a dollar into the tip jar she’ll play a painstaking rendition of ‘Hot Cross Buns.’ Oh listen—the teacher’s reminding her about ‘All Cows Eat Grass’ because she keeps messing up the left-hand part.” At press time a smattering of applause was heard from the diners as a student’s mom joined the duo on stage to read a magazine in the corner.

At last we have proof that its deliciousness remains untamed.” At press time Stephens was brushing crumbs from his beard while telling reporters that the Pop’ette had regretfully flown away.

While we have yet to establish a motive or common ideology behind this violence we urge you to stay alert and vigilant because these attacks can really come out of nowhere.” At press time several police departments around the country warned residents to be on guard after they pledged to increase their presence in Asian American neighborhoods.

We wouldn’t even watch it but just knowing it was there would definitely provide the sort of forbidden edge to your sex life that could take it to the next level. So what do you think?” The researchers added that they would be strictly professional about the entire matter unless you absolutely insisted they join in.

But he told us he was positive that he didn’t shoot anyone. That was really reassuring for the whole force. He was there at the massage parlors after all. Who knows what happened better than him?” Reynolds added that as an extra precaution the suspect would  need to sign his own statement saying he hadn’t shot anyone before they dismissed his charges and let him head home.

But once we heard over and over and over again that this election would be a referendum on the soul of America and that no one had a right to just sit at home and do nothing we decided we ought to get involved. If we had to be honest it was probably the 15000th email from Nancy Pelosi that finally convinced us.” Russian officials added that they were beginning to question their own participation in the election however noting that despite so many people saying that everything rode on its outcome it didn’t seem like much of anything was really going to change.

There really wasn’t anything that was going to keep this individual from snapping and killing a lot of people if that’s what they really wanted.” At press time residents of the only economically advanced nation in the world where roughly two mass shootings have occurred every month for the past eight years were referring to themselves and their situation as “helpless.”

Plus they’re a major threat to Labrador retrievers and German shepherds. We don’t want these malformed beasts interbreeding and infecting the rest of the dog population. Hopefully eliminating a few thousand of these pups will allow other breeds to flourish.” At press time officials added a stern reminder that the too-cute-for-words English bulldog was strictly off limits.

Believe me you don’t want to show up here right now with everyone all crammed together and stacked on top of one another. Just be patient. Soon we’ll have so many new detention centers along our southern border you won’t even recognize the place.” Biden also issued an appeal specific to asylum seekers asking them not to make the arduous journey north until the United States had enough planes gassed up and ready to take them back to where they came from the moment they arrived.

Heck it could have wandered into a black hole or worse. Thankfully it’s all tuckered out and resting now. In the morning we’re hoping to get it back to the Kuiper Belt where it belongs.” Jurczyk added that ultimately if the agency could not get the asteroid back to its parents several engineers had expressed interest in adopting it.

Clearly we may need to reevaluate some of our ideas about the Son of God especially now that our scholarship has revealed how Christ actively incited a crowd on the Mount of Olives to stone an adulterer to death.” Atherton went on to state that the gospel story of Jesus causing a herd of pigs to become possessed by demons and run off a cliff to their death was however perfectly translated.

We’re just glad their friendship survived that time Le Le made a pass at Ya Ya in the feeding pen. She didn’t reciprocate and thankfully he backed off right away before things could get too weird.” Wentz noted this was especially fortunate considering the pandas haven’t seen any other members of their species for a couple decades and have to share space that when you’re a giant bear gets kind of tight.

But please keep in mind that while these mass vaccination beaches will be open 24/7 it is first stabbed first served.” DeSantis added that if Sunshine Staters wished to cover the small puncture wound left by their accidental injection they should be able to find plenty of loose Band-Aids washing ashore nearby.

Fortunately though it uses blockchain and that’s really hot right now. If this goes well then in the future I may put some actual serious money into these NFTs.” Engel went on to state that in addition to being a potentially interesting investment vehicle the NFT also came with a bunch of pictures he could look at.

At first when I saw all the crates of ammunition I hoped they were just keeping sacks of rice from sliding around underneath but it turned out that it was ammunition all the way down. We keep gently trying to suggest that there can be more to humanitarian aid than just more guns but I guess guns is just what they’ve got. I’m not really sure what my starving children are supposed to do with these pistol grips. I even had my son bring a few of our extra rifles to see if we could trade them for some kind of grains but I guess we’ll have to try again next month.” At press time Fazluddin conceded that the box of body armor the humanitarian aid convoy issued her technically qualified as new clothing.

That’s old hat and we need fresh thinking; maybe there’s some sort of separate line for Black people and then their ballots get fed directly into an incinerator.

In fact the  pressures of adding crumbled ground beef pickled jalapeños chopped tomatoes or a dollop of sour cream even led to Americans shirking the institution altogether.” At press time Dr. Jehnsen added that Americans were also putting off having children in order to focus on boiling several hot dogs placing them inside store-bought buns and covering them in ketchup.

Murray adding that such websites often target  pups as young as 6 months old with bigoted messages about the purity of  thoroughbred bloodlines and inherent cultural inferiority of mutts.  “What’s insidious is these reactionary forums groom their young members  with treats belly rubs and exposure to other members’ anal glands.  That’s the sort of recruiting strategy that makes dogs like Major  willing to do anything to prove loyalty to their far-right pack—even  give paw. Often they’re in so deep that only  a  newspaper to the snout can help them break free.” Secret Service officials went on to emphasize that despite his past actions Major  remained a very good boy.

Salinger novels Wednesday as good but not “go out and shoot a celebrity” good. “Don’t get us wrong there’s the same wry prose and pitch-perfect characterization of uniquely American individuals that made Salinger into a household name but if we’re being totally honest nobody’s going to go out and blow someone’s brain out over these” said professor Sheila Heidt noting that the as-yet-unseen works were a “B maybe a B+” that likely wouldn’t inspire psychotic individuals to do more than hit a celebrity a few times with a tire iron. “Unfortunately would-be assassins will likely find that the novel’s tendency towards the maudlin and a muddled narrative fail to evoke the passion required to take down a singer or presidential candidate.” Heidt added that among the manuscripts was a sequel to Franny And Zooey so bad it could cause people to perform life-saving surgery on someone famous.

Over the next eight episodes we’ll take you on a journey where we spoke to former coworkers family members customers and ex-lovers of the embattled commenter to turn the mirror back on him and paint a fuller picture of who he is. Journalism while Mr. Whitson may disagree is built on a careful examination of the facts and the uncovering of difficult truths however unpleasant.

Mark Milley the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who added that while the military had made strides in recent years proportional representation of women and people of color among leadership remained just a fraction of the diversity represented in countries like Afghanistan Iraq Yemen and Somalia. “In country after country we invade we see that there’s a diversity that’s lacking among our top leaders and this initiative will take steps to change that imbalance. We need more Muslims more folks of Arabic descent not only African Americans but Africans too. We don’t have children represented at all at the top levels of Pentagon leadership. When the U.S. is ignoring every tenet of international law to pursue its own financially driven objectives in your country whether you’re a victim of a drone strike had your government overthrown or just live in the daily terror of violence you should be able to point to one of the people doing that to you and say ‘That person looks like me.’” U.S. military officials announced that their first phase would involve armed recruitment of potential candidates representing the backgrounds of countries they invade and they were prepared to integrate them into leadership by force.

But with great effort and introspection he’ll be able to understand the origin of his hatred of dissidents and see that he doesn’t need to be controlled by these feelings.

But we believe we’re on track for Bigfoot to be clobbering an entire environmentally friendly line of cars before the end of the decade.” Kurtz added that the organizers would buy carbons offsets for any gasoline needed to light the death-defying rings of fire that the Xterminator would be jumping through this Sunday at the Raymond James Stadium.

Plus it’s a pretty big meatball so that’s nice.” At press time the Little Italy neighborhood had been further reduced to a marinara smear and a single sprig of parsley.

I worry the only way we’re ever going to be together is if I completely reconfigure my spike proteins and change myself into something I don’t even recognize anymore.” At press time the coronavirus confided to sources that it hoped Milfay knew it was done fooling around with bats.

Watkins director of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory describing the emotional moment when a dozen viable research crafts—their tiny chassis covered in oil and titanium shavings—were expelled from the parent rover’s motorized womb into the red dust on the planet’s surface. “It will be months before these little guys can open up their image sensors and begin rolling around on their own but once they do their mother will teach them how to collect samples and analyze soil composition. Of course our ultimate goal is to continue breeding them for generations so we can establish a permanent colony of rovers on Mars. For now though these tots will be cradled in their mother’s robotic arms suckling on her power reserves until they reach maturity.” At press time the Chinese National Space Administration had demanded joint custody of the infant rovers claiming a routine paternity test would show its Tianwen-1 spacecraft currently in orbit around Mars was the true father.

I was absolutely going to fight and die for the king’s honor. Unfortunately typhus was just how most people died in those days.” At press time Brictric was rapidly backpedaling after an enthusiastic Flemish cavalryman who had been immolated in a torrent of hot oil at Antioch asked which brigade he served in.

By inviting the cool kids over to shoot soda cans on tree stumps while you’re out at work and maybe stealing some vodka from the liquor cabinet your child also becomes three times more likely to lose their virginity before graduation and six times more likely to be crowned at homecoming.” The study added that this effect is negated however if your child accidentally commits manslaughter while playing around with the gun with their younger sibling.

We can only assume the artist would be horrified to know his garbage pile is now a UNESCO World Heritage site visited by more than a million tourists each year.” Li went on to observe that the clay soldiers missing heads and limbs were not the victims of natural disasters or vandalism over the past 2200 years but rather instances in which the artist grew so frustrated he physically attacked his own creations.

We also recommend hiring a third-party appraiser to evaluate the bear before finalizing a payment of six figures or more.” Kirby added that a person unwilling to buy such a gift for the “bear-y special person” in their life should stop to consider whether they are in the right relationship.

We estimate B. bratwurstus crawled out of the ocean approximately 300 million years ago.

With that said if you are going to gather please keep any performances to a quartet.

Meanwhile the non-fruit flavors like cinnamon and root beer are people with no preexisting conditions. Really it’s astonishing to imagine how many jelly beans might need to fill this jar before this is all over.” Blitzer added that to commemorate the stark moment in American history CNN would be offering a $50 Menards gift card to any viewer who called in and correctly guessed the jar’s exact number of jelly beans.

And I let them know even if things do get serious the most they’d ever have to deal with is an occasional visit to lay flowers at her graveside.” Dugas added that even if she found the right man she had no plans to have any living children of her own since she knew she’d be a pretty terrible mother.

How naive do you think I am? And I guarantee you that the recollections I do have of storming the Capitol are because Bill Gates used one of his 5G satellites to pump fake memories into my brain.” Keleher also reportedly told investigators that if he had been at the Capitol he would have assuredly been there as part of some false-flag operation in which case there was no question in his mind that he was secretly an FBI operative.

We have a lot to learn from this group and their ways of tunneling through the earth so we’ve brought in teams of anthropologists to attempt to speak to them in their own tongue in order to glean information into their way of life. It appears that much like us they also use small brushes to clean dust and debris from artifacts. Ultimately we’re hopeful that this is discovery will offer crucial additions to our understanding of how they do archaeological work elsewhere on the planet.” The archaeological team added that it had had to tread carefully after one of the members of the team fell in love with one of the archaeologists who had dug through from the other side of the globe.

Sure it doesn’t have all the glitz and glamor of the real thing but I’m getting way more one-on-one time with the president than I normally would.” At press time a drunk Hines was arguing with his Biden cutout when the president seemed uninterested in his corporate tax concerns.

To  be honest I’m surprised I haven’t been hearing more about this on the  news.” At press time Hopkins was struck by the solemness of the moment  after realizing the inauguration had taken place at the same location  where President Robert Kennedy was shot.

Of course as the podcast got more and more successful the central lie became bigger we added more fake reporters to the podcast and we even conjured up illegitimate stories that could help turn our fake Mr. Barbaro into a media darling. We let it completely get out of hand. Ultimately Mr. Barbaro and The Daily are just some of the more whimsical creations our staff came up with and we apologize for misleading readers so extensively.” At press time the New York Times was forced to issue a flurry of additional apologies and retractions after reports emerged that executive editor Baquet was also a fabrication and that the newspaper had based nearly all of its stories for decades on anonymous sources that also turned out not to exist.

Trust me this kid is going to do big big things in terrifying minorities in the next couple of years. Remember the name Peter Nowak now because pretty soon you’re not going to be able to forget it.” At press time Wray added that although he had sadly decided to remove Abdul Rahman Yasin after years on the list it did not diminish the FBI’s abiding respect for his work on the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.

That’s the way it’s always been for them out there in the unbroken wild. There’s no such thing as stress or disappointment when you’re out bounding toward the endless frontier. There’s only the blue sky above—so perfect blue you’d swear it was a painting—and the hard clay below. That’s how it is for horses.” At press time the researchers went on to suggest that maybe the reason we tame the splendor of wild horses is because of the haunting emptiness of our own lives.

It’s empty and super creepy all the time even at the height of the season. If you walk up and ask for a ticket they give you a weird look like they clearly are not expecting real customers.

But the fact is we’ve only been able to administer about a third of our current vaccine supply and if they don’t cut out all the jibber-jabber about how their grandson Mark is 35 and somehow still single despite having a good job and being so handsome then hundreds of thousands more Americans will die.

Really the bulging vein on his forehead is what gives him away along with the few million other Americans who look just like him.” At press time Bowdich had confirmed that the plethora of written and video evidence of the man posted on social media also meant the FBI believed they could start questioning suspects by mid-2022.

Right now in tens of thousands of schools across America children are being educated without paying a single dime for the privilege.

Soon the cool rivers will turn to burning acrid pools and our dairy supply will be threatened as cows go mad and stampede to their deaths. This could cut agribusiness earnings as much as 60% in the third quarter.” At press time Censky was urging all Americans to burn any unmarried women over the age of 40 lest there be a witch in our midst.

Plus my wife thinks it’s an eyesore. I guess I could leave it in the nook downstairs but I’ll probably just throw it up on eBay and see how much people are willing to pay.” At press time Bruckner had left Devin Nunes on his curb with a “Free” sign for anyone interested.

Should candidates wish to flip some of these voters to either Obama-Clinton-Obama-Clinton or Romney-Trump-Romney-Trump they’ll have their work cut out for them.” At press time Underwood added that these voters were notoriously hard to court because casting their vote for a different candidate could create a time paradox that irrevocably changed the world thereby erasing them forever from the spacetime continuum.

But that simply isn’t the case here. Let’s try this: Have you ever had a pet maybe a dog or a cat that you loved and one day it stopped breathing and became very very still? Maybe you had a little burial out in the yard? So this is the same thing only it’s happened to almost 2 million people around the world some of whom lived in your very own community. Notice we say ‘lived’ in the past tense. That’s because these people are no longer alive. That’s what can happen and if it does happen to someone you love you’ll never see them again and they’ll never see you again and that will probably be very sad. Hopefully this clears things up a little.” The report coincides with an attempt by top economists to convince Congress to take Covid’s financial effects on the American people more seriously by explaining the concept of people.

If we had been on the same page since day one we could have skipped the whole 2018 midterm!

Getting everyone in the Crüe immunized will take time and we ask for the patience of valued members like Nikki Sixx who based on our criteria will likely fall somewhere in the middle despite his role as the band’s primary songwriter. While there are clearly many variables at work we do know that because he is the youngest member of the group and can be socially distanced upon a massive drum riser Tommy Lee may not see a vaccine until 2022—behind not only his own bandmates but also senior members of Ratt Quiet Riot and W.A.S.P.” Redfield went on to say that it should be quick and easy for Neil to receive his injection seeing as he has not worn a shirt with sleeves in the past several decades.

After that the Ghost Of Christmas Present opens his robe to reveal two children Ignorance and Want who proceed to kick Scrooge repeatedly in the groin while shouting ‘This one’s for Tiny Tim bitch.’ It was in fact Dickens’ publisher who suggested that he instead focus on the miser’s transformative arc and adjust the original ending where the ghosts paraded Scrooge’s bruised corpse through the streets of London.” Mulroney added that this was the most significant Dickens-related discovery since archivists uncovering a draft of Oliver Twist in which the ravenous orphan bites out Mr. Limbkins’ trachea after being refused more gruel.

Two people using one monolithic persona to post about ‘our day off’ or ‘our doctor’s appointment’ or a book ‘we liked’ is not acceptable. And it doesn’t get any better when they use ‘I’ or ‘me’ because then we aren’t sure if they mean Lisa or Greg or what.”“By the way if Lisa seriously thinks this shared account is going to prevent Greg’s old girlfriends from finding a way to contact him she’s fooling herself” Tomkins continued. “He’s right there on LinkedIn.”FTC officials also argued that Facebook should split up the account as soon as possible to prevent the couple from merging it with the separate but equally weird one they have for their dog.

I want to know what metrics they’re using. Assist rate? Games played? Hey how about you play Folklore from start to finish instead and try to tell me you don’t feel something.

There is hope that we could have another batch of the vaccine by 2024; however those future recipients have already been notified as well.” Redfield strongly advised anyone who was not currently scheduled to be injected with the life-saving vaccine to shelter in place indefinitely.

The money’s not great right now on a public servant salary but this is just the first step to getting into the House of Representatives maybe a mid-city mayorship and finally make it to the lobbyist level. I can’t wait.” Talley also admitted that it did make him nervous to see how many of his state senate colleagues were also competing to be lobbyists someday.

Or I can just scroll through Bed Bath & Beyond grab three of these things alongside some actual glass cups and literally revolutionize his sad life for under $25. I should get a couple chambray button downs and a crew neck sweater so he doesn’t just wear ratty old T-shirts every single day.

Having the laser lights pulse in sync with the music represents the culmination of thousands of hours of hard work that went into developing an inoculation against Covid-19.

I mean it shakes me to the core thinking about what I did to all those children—endorsing the Subway Kids’ Pak as a nutritious alternative to a real meal is an atrocity that no one should ever be subjected to.

I could go to that Alain Ducasse place around the block but their caramelized quail eggs aren’t going to hit the spot right now. Plus I think they only have two stars. Christ I haven’t sunk that low yet.” At press time Hammond had been annoyed to open his fridge and only find a single cube of Matsusaka Wagyu smeared with eel sauce.

The sad thing is that no matter how many injections I give out there’s always a long line of people who still haven’t gotten one but you have to focus on the little bit of difference that you can make.” Barr added that he had put together his own homemade cocktail of deadly chemicals which added a more personalized touch than giving out some generic store-bought potassium chloride.

We have reason to believe every atom may be on here and how long does it take to get from atoms to an atom bomb? These Iranians are operating in a laboratory stocked with test tubes protective goggles Bunsen burners you name it. What’s more our intelligence indicates they are experimenting with these chemicals under the guidance of a chemistry expert and writing down their observations. For the sake of global security we must assume these young people are busy creating weapons-grade uranium—an element by the way that is included right there in plain sight on this chart.” At press time Pompeo had called for a full-scale preemptive assault on the training facility after learning the building contained a separate room in which Iranian youths were allegedly preparing for combat by doing pushups climbing ropes and running relay races.

Voter fraud is actually super rare in the United States and even if there were a few isolated incidents it wouldn’t have affected the outcome of the election. It only took two minutes to debunk the whole thing. I felt kind of silly. We should probably be more concerned about the distrust that this is creating in the U.S. electoral process.” At press time Barr had backpedaled after stumbling upon a thread from a QAnon supporter.

Sure I’m completely broke and haven’t been able to eat for a couple days but it’s the thought that counts you know?” Vasiliadis went on to remark that the only thing nicer than passersby patting their pockets was when they told him they would keep him in their prayers.

Trying to understand the number of calculations needed to run [word processing software] Vizawrite would probably cause our rudimentary brains to collapse from sheer strain. We are but chimps in the presence of its godlike computing abilities.” Wu noted a related discovery that the Commodore 64’s beige plastic casing was also far more attractive than the average human’s face.

Well what did you people expect? Their real-life struggle is the same ridiculous thing over and over again. All those holler dimwits are so drunk off their asses and strung out on heroin it’s impossible to make a coherent story about them.

I know I’m being kind of nitpicky but it’s easier to watch these historical dramas when the plot details are a little more convincing.” At press time sources confirmed Galanis had decided not to finish The Crown and to instead watch the Netflix show about the queen playing chess.

In fact President Carter’s reelection campaign was doomed from the beginning because of how many hours he spent daily feeling his way along the sides of a wall expecting to bump into a corner. He never did. We don’t intend to let that happen again.” At press time the administration had sent out an email announcing a fundraising goal of $15 million to build an exact replica of the Oval Office in downtown Wilmington for Biden to explore.

Redfield adding that the CDC agents had guaranteed the halt of any the coronavirus spread with the additional dynamiting of 50000 miles of highways carpet-bombing of all significant rail lines and placing heads on pikes outside most bus depots as a warning to would-be travelers. “Your safety is our foremost concern which is why we also recommend that Americans avoid traveling on public transportation  as each and every bus and train has been rigged to explode with C-4 if anyone steps on-board. Anyway it’s just common sense to take care of yourself and wait to see relatives until late 2021 when the sarin gas clears from your hometown.” At press time an AP journalist following up on whether healthy young Americans were advised to travel home had immediately been taken out by a five-kiloton bomb dropped from a CDC drone.

Please note that with tougher pieces of gristle or a stale bread heel this whole process may take several tries.” HHS officials went on to announce they had updated the universal sign for choking to include a motion in which one pantomimes eating a hoagie.

Of course that never happened. The truth is that they only had access to elk.” At press time Hampstead had rapidly ushered reporters out of his office pulled the blinds and started furiously masturbating to an ink block print.

I assure the American people once you hear them sing ‘I’d Like To Buy The World A Coke’ your faith in our country will be restored.” At press time Biden was under fire after evidence surfaced that the children had fervently supported the Iraq War despite their motto of “world peace for all.”

Also I know we have some people flying in from out of state and I think as long as they hug high-risk people from the side instead of face to face that should stop the spread.” Elliott added that even though she had a fever and a bit of a cough she was sure she’d be over it by the time her family arrived.

Naturally numbers will be limited at first but by April we’re hoping this new mutation will be easily contractible across the entire country. And on top of that we’re absolutely certain it will be available worldwide by the end of 2021.” At press time the virus spokesperson added it was impossible to overstate how none of this would be possible without the Trump administration.

After all this salad has been in the FDA pipeline for two years. If we were to put off this study and turn our attention to the vaccine we’d be putting millions of Americans’ healthy quick to-go meal options at stake.” At press time the FDA announced it would have to further delay the coronavirus vaccine approval after the agency received a top-priority request to review a new experimental Lunchables pack for emergency-use authorization.

This is reaffirmed by the fact that during the pandemic your situation has been comparatively much more pathetic than any other person on the planet. So while others can expect to regain a sense of belonging once the pandemic is resolved you will remain alone.” The report concluded that you would carry this sadness with you forever because you are fundamentally unlikable and incapable of being close to people.

Gavin Newsom of California was widely criticized Thursday for eating at The French Laundry when Atelier Crenn offers a clearly superior take on contemporary cuisine. “It’s absolutely unthinkable that the governor would attend a gathering at an establishment that peaked 15 years ago when he and top lobbyists could have dined at Chef Dominique Crenn’s strikingly inventive restaurant instead” said Bay Area resident Ian Samuels blasting Newsom for how out of touch he appeared to be with the modern gastronomic landscape. “How can we trust this man to lead us when his taste in restaurants is so pedestrian? It’s upsetting to see him violate the fine-dining standards being scrupulously followed by millions of Californians—and for a completely prosaic and uninspired interpretation of Nova Scotia lobster galette no less.” At press time Newsom had issued a scathing review of The French Laundry in response to criticism.

But remember it’s perfectly legal to open a restaurant if the tables chairs kitchen and bar area are all inside so long as that restaurant itself is outside.” At press time Newsom drew criticism after adding exceptions for restaurants located within other restaurants to open so long as diners were socially distanced and under capacity.

He lives in Indianapolis and he owned a large cache of child pornography. On the other hand it turns out he’s a pretty good dad if you discount that whole incident and he has three brothers who really loved him until this all came out. Really we’re just trying to add some nuance to a registry that used to seem a little too black and white.” Ehrlich added that the new protocols would also encourage pederasts to go around their neighborhood and say one positive thing about themselves before diving into their prior crimes.

We will also close them at 11 p.m. every night to ensure we don’t spread coronavirus any more than we have to. During this troubling time we’re doing everything we can so we also ask everyone to remain calm. This is an emergency situation and we may run out of critical supplies like tequila and limes.” Lightfoot added that if the coronavirus spread could not be contained Chicago officials would be forced to turn some of the city’s parks and beaches into pop-up hospital bars.

But her house isn’t decorated with any framed quotes from new age gurus or anything like that.

Of course one must engage oneself completely in the study and practice of being sexually abused in order for the sacrament to be fully administered and once being initiated you are expected to teach these practices to future generations. Some may say we are acting in haste today but in fact we are simply acknowledging and preserving the rite that so many of our priests and church leaders have performed for generations.” Before hurrying out of the press conference Pope Francis confirmed that any deceased people who had not received the sacrament of child molestation were bound to eternal limbo.

In the meantime we’ll go to Anderson Cooper to see if there are any new developments since air traffic controllers lost contact” stammered Blitzer as a sweating visibly nervous CNN analyst John King moved from the network’s Magic Wall showing most states grayed out to a map of Southeast Asia where he marked areas that represented the flight’s trajectory and the last time it had been heard from in March 2014. “Right so while the search has covered around 50000 square miles it has so far failed to turn up more than parts of a plane’s right wing and right stabilizer that could have been part of the vanished Boeing 777 aircraft and there’s been a whole host of controversy surrounding the Malaysian government’s response to the plane’s disappearance. While we’re um waiting to confirm anything on the West Coast or even get some reliable exit polling out of Michigan or Pennsylvania that might tell us which way the election is going we’ll be hearing from an official from the International Civil Aviation Association about the likelihood a plane could go missing and what kinds of changes have been made in aviation safety over the past six years.

I’m probably being overcautious but if a scenario develops in which the social contract has been voided and everyone starts killing everyone else just to snatch whatever valuables they have on their person I’ll be glad I did. Not sure I need much else though. Maybe some extra batteries for the TV remote?” At press time reports confirmed Miller had begun to panic after browsing the beverage section and realizing the store didn’t carry blue Gatorade.

We recommend waiting until the fires have at least subsided into smoldering embers before continuing construction on the sunroom or fitness center and we pledge to let you know as soon as your guest wing project can resume. In the meantime if you must continue building a patio or gazebo we recommend stone materials as these will work best in the face of the flames currently moving through your properties.” Orange County officials added that they had already secured millions of dollars in emergency funding from California to allow local residents to build their third dream homes after the fire was extinguished.

Even though I’m leaving today with a new dog it pains me to know so many of those who remain will have their lives cut short before ever getting posed next to a person who is also dressed like a Ghostbuster or next to a cat dressed like Slimer. Unfortunately thousands of senior dogs pit bulls and Chihuahuas get put down too soon despite the fact that most of them can still really clean up on Halloween.” Kessler went on to acknowledge that some pets may simply whine and chew at their costumes after they are dressed up at which point it may indeed be time to take them to a vet and have them euthanized.

We can all commit today to being part of the solution to rising carbon dioxide levels by creating pristine new planets. Several Silicon Valley leaders have made generous financial contributions to planting new Earths of course but sustainability starts at home—even planting an Earth in your yard or on your rooftop will help ensure that there are enough new planets to help support human life.” The Project Plant-An-Earth founders added that they were also demanding sustainability by calling on any viable new planets to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 5.2 billion years from now.

That’s nonnegotiable of course. Once we have a ceasefire in place it is my hope we will sign a permanent treaty that allows us to lay down our arms and apart from the occasional incineration of an entire village live in peace.” Both Armenia and Azerbaijan reassured the international community that during a ceasefire the use of all other weapons including guns and hand grenades would be strictly limited to close-quarter combat situations in which missiles weren’t an option.

And what’s even more impressive is that this specimen has the wider beak and slightly stubbier rostral bone which got completely scrapped early on meaning this skull is definitely from the original run of the Ceratopsidae species. I almost feel bad because the Goodwill cashier was only asking 10 bucks for the whole thing so he clearly had no idea what he was sitting on.” Marida added that incredibly the triceratops skull was not even the most significant find of the day noting that a member of his team had discovered a Freewheelin’ Bob Dylan record still in its original shrink wrap.

But of course I know that I can’t just draw conclusions from a few yard signs which is why I try to spend my commute every day looking at yard signs in other neighborhoods. They can help you stay informed and they show you that the race is closer than it might appear. I mean yesterday I saw 60% Biden signs and today I saw 40% Biden signs so it’s going to be a close race. But I do have to stop myself from getting too caught up in it and doom-reading every single sign I see.” The highly informed voter derided any attempt to forecast the election winner after noting that no one even seemed to be talking about the candidate ADT Security despite the large number of signs in nearby yards.

Sure I’ve seen more places than most kids my age—Yemen Somalia Nigeria you name it—but before I  get a chance to really experience them Dad carries out another righteous attack against the unbelievers and we’re rushed off to the next staging ground.

Ross Dress For Less had to fight tooth and nail to get on there and it’s not going to be any different for you pal.” Mavros added that it’s irrelevant that half of the shops listed on the sign are currently out of business as Smith Optics will have to fucking bring it regardless.

All those ugly antennae have been concealed by lifelike plastic branches and finely manicured acrylic pines needles. These professional designers are really good. It’s actually quite classy.” Bridenstine added the administration would also affix a replica bald eagle to the top of the tower to scare away pigeons.

These servings of kung pao chicken and egg rolls seemed to be eaten primarily as fuel for teams of high-powered attorneys running on only four hours of sleep as they became deeply invested in the case often before gasping when a pile of papers fell off the table to reveal the evidence that they had been searching for all along.” The study also found that the other 13% of Chinese takeout was eaten by the overweight child molesters the prosecutors were investigating.

We found it notable that almost immediately upon exiting the atmosphere astronauts  experienced an acute awareness that humankind is a writhing mass of maggots meaningless and purposeless in the ocean of nothingness that is the universe.” The report also found that the feelings of repugnance were so powerful that many of these astronauts began to wish they could remain in orbit and never return home.

The poor guy can’t even get the N-word out without having to get a breath of oxygen even though he used to throw that around a hundred times a day.” At press time the White House staff had created a signal system where Trump could point out the slur he wanted to use on a giant whiteboard.

Don’t like the decision? Mosey across the street. That’s how you hook the suckers. It’s all about location location location.

It’s at least 750 miles long at least the part we’ve tracked so far and it’s definitely plugged into the country somewhere because when you try to pull it it doesn’t give. Of course we don’t want to pull on it too hard in case we unplug it from wherever it’s plugged into. That could be really bad. We’re pretty sure we’ve ruled out it being an electrical grid thing but our big worry is that it’s from one of those big New Deal projects that never got labeled but still connects to some key piece of infrastructure. I guess all we can do is keep looking.” At press time the Army Corps of Engineers decided to unplug the cable and former President Jimmy Carter immediately died.

Oftentimes stubborn patients like Trump think they can open up their brain themselves and ensure their blood phlegm yellow bile and black bile are in perfect harmony when really that is not the case.” At press time physicians expressed greater concern after Trump released a video showing him covered in leeches and receiving an infusion of horse blood for strength.

He was looking at me when he threw it out. I was standing right here waiting to catch it during his whole coughing fit and then you swooped in at the last second and stole it from me!” Having emerged from the struggle with a tissue to take home a visibly excited Reynolds told reporters he would be preserving it for posterity and was “never going to wash [his] hands again!”

No one in Nike gear should ever be breathing heavily and running all hunched over with their arms on their hips like that—never mind the bumbling lethargic pace.

He also has the bat version of diabetes. A number of these viruses are only sexually transmitted between bats so this is extremely concerning. An especially interesting contagion located inside Mr. Giuliani’s chest is linked to the only known fossilized remains of a rare Tibetan bat species which was buried with the inscription ‘kha rdung pho wang’ roughly translating to ‘curse of the small winged mammal.’” At press time Dr. Ellis was struggling to make sense of an abdominal scan of Giuliani which appeared to show six live bats living comfortably inside his liver.

Sure it tugs at the heartstrings a bit to see a father and daughter lying on the hood of a car and smiling as airplanes fly overhead—how could it not? I just don’t get how the hell his decision to lease a Lincoln Corsair for $337 a month factors into any of this.” Buckley went on to state that he wasn’t even sure he wanted his daughter to pursue a career as an astronaut observing that it’s a long-shot job at best and in any case his 9-year-old loves animals and wants to be a marine biologist.

I got it hooked on ketamine” said the Georgia Tech researcher adding that he felt responsible after seeing the mouse reduced to a junkie living in a filthy cage and spending all of its time awaiting its next fix. “It’s been an addict for over half its lifetime and it’s all my fault. If I could go back in time and stop myself from offering it ketamine I would. We were just doing a clinical trial and I didn’t think it would hurt anyone but I didn’t stop to ask myself whether slipping drugs to a young impressionable mouse would have consequences.” “I mean this is a mouse that used to be able to easily race through a maze a mouse that fathered children and now it won’t do anything unless it involves scoring drugs.” added Foster lamenting that he had ruined a bright future in neurological testing for the small rodent. “This was the smartest mouse I knew. Now he just keeps pushing that button for more drugs. He’s starving himself to death. He had everything going for him. What have I done?”The researcher who admitted that he was struggling to sleep at night because he had “blood on his hands” expressed remorse that his conduct had helped to tear apart the once-vibrant mouse community.

We’ll be applying the cream in gentle circular motions from the Bay Area down through the Sierra Nevada region and all the way up to the Oregon border. Then we’ll follow with a gentle SPF 30 setting spray to prevent further sun damage to the already crispy leaves.” Porter added that while the program is expensive taxpayers save millions thanks to state prison inmates who are paid $1 per acre to administer the forests’ autumn exfoliation regimen.

Since its inception Alethia has striven always to take inspiration from the journal’s unofficial mascot Calliope the muse of epic poetry and seek out the ecstatic harmony of the artistic voice and so we want to say thank you to everyone who thumbed through an issue in our college’s bookstore or received a free copy for donating to our GoFundMe for sharing this incredible journey with us.” Dunny added his hope that the journal’s legacy would live on in the form of two current seniors talking about starting a flash fiction zine after they graduated.

We have every reason to believe there is a strong physical attraction  between these two celestial bodies.” At press time the Moon had reportedly broken up with Earth after discovering the planet had 7.8 billion children who were completely sucking the life out of it.

Usually these kinds of pains would just go away in a week or two but now they’re really starting to hurt and lasting longer. I’m getting older so hopefully the burning sensation isn’t a symptom of some much more serious issue. I have been feeling warmer lately which I’d say is heat flashes or something but it doesn’t really seem to be getting better. Man I hope I’m okay.” Earth added that it was also having trouble breathing lately but hoped it was just due to seasonal allergies and not some life-threatening condition.

If it’s not working something as simple as placing your mouth around the barrel of the gun while maintaining unblinking eye contact is almost guaranteed to resolve things.” Marco added that grabbing your pursuer and jumping off a bridge was nearly as effective provided you possess basic swimming skills.

If we’re able to stick to these guidelines enrollees should be able to dance and cavort around in the woods like a normal school year.” Redfield cautioned that weird little private schools should still avoid higher risk activities such as gathering together in a guitar circle to sing a medley of Simon & Garfunkel songs until at least next semester.

In the past few years it seems like Earth people have developed new ways to listen for us as if that’s going to change our minds and send us rushing to contact them.

Interns are vital to the day-to-day operation of Heaven and receive valuable on-the-job training in an authentic everlasting paradise. A lot of people don’t realize our own blessed Gabriel worked his way up from summer intern to Archangel and Divine Messenger over the course of just a few millennia.” God added that while the internship itself was unpaid participants may be eligible to receive course credit at one of the many unaccredited Bible colleges across the United States.

To improve your credit score and maintain it in the future you can try reducing your credit utilization or paying off existing balances in full although since you didn’t have bad personal finance habits before we can’t promise that doing so will cause us to raise your score in any way.

They don’t squawk or anything; they just kind of go ‘thunk.’” Because the researchers were reportedly late for a conference and did not stop to look for the owl they were unable to confirm their hypothesis that the bird’s hollow bones had probably fractured into thousands of really tiny shards.

Fame. These so-called journalists are handing months worth of free publicity to the virus on a silver platter! That’s why as a service to all Americans I and my fellow anchors at Fox News will refuse to show its photo a body count or even say its name because we believe that doing so would encourage it and only serve to elevate it to a mythical status it so deeply desires.” At press time Carlson took several minutes to decry networks like CNN and MSNBC for being the “real virus” and accused them of having the blood of Americans all over their hands.

Just don’t leave it out here in the sun too long or it may turn. Don’t tell anyone but the secret ingredient is Miracle Whip. Gives it a tangy little kick.” At press time Iowa had been overheard loudly commenting that they hoped Illinois would at least rinse the bowl before giving it back this time.

Our research also indicates that beholding the sight of an alpaca or even one of those giant emu birds for that matter would similarly break the monotony of your everyday life in an agreeable fashion.” The report added that seeing a squirrel or a dog however would not be as enjoyable as you see them every day.

I approach every civilian with the same number of bullets in my chamber regardless of skin color. I mean I shot that guy nine times in the back. Would a racist do that? And he was definitely white. Well we found that out afterward. The lighting wasn’t very good at the time.” At press time Denney admitted he initially thought the man he had gunned down was biracial.

We can only hope a larger market for tap modern and hip-hop opens up soon to absorb some of the impact this newly unbridled passion for movement has had on the economy. These numbers are even worse than what we saw when millions of workers left to go find themselves in Asia in 2008.” Historians confirmed this year’s job losses are the highest recorded since struggling Americans migrated to California in hopes of dancing in a lavishly produced Busby Berkeley musical during the Great Depression.

To everyone who helped me on this crazy pie-in-the-sky journey towards ‘Stoplight City’ thank you. Sometimes life feels like a dream.” At press time Buttigieg had been accused by many Evansville residents of merely using his run in their city as a publicity stunt to one day become the mayor of Fort Wayne.

As closing time nears we expect the president to sow confusion with false claims that he ordered his burger without a pickle or that his appetizer never arrived. If we do nothing and he’s able to convince enough diners and ultimately get the waitstaff to heel Bob Evans as we know it may be at an end.” Porter closed his remarks by urging those in power to act now by refusing to refill the president’s water glass and placing the check face down in front of him on the table.

Mr. Bannon was successfully taken into custody however and is being held in the hermetically sealed titanium-lined containment unit designed and constructed in anticipation of his arrest.” On a more optimistic note Barksdale stated that the 30-mile radius of blighted landscape surrounding Bannon’s home had already begun to recover with the barren ecological wasteland showing signs of plant and animal life for the first time in decades.

We at AMC cannot in good conscience allow moviegoers to fill theaters that are this sticky and completely reek.” At press time AMC was establishing protocols limiting the amount of candy sold to those under 14 but stressed they could not completely rule out future instances of children hurling all over the backs of customers’ heads.

Plus if any of these people get severely injured or burned to death while they’re trying to get back into their houses nobody cries ‘brutality’ so it’s really a win-win for us.” Boccia went on to praise the fires’ smoke-filled air and punishing heat for providing a deterrent to homeless Californians living on the street.

She then charged several tractors before she tuckered herself out and laid down across multiple lanes on I-80 stopping traffic. We estimate the jumbo lady porker caused about $6 billion in damage before the National Guard was able to coax her back into her pen with a nice red apple.” Naig urged Iowans to avoid getting between the fat oinker mama and her piglets because she’s extremely protective and liable to bite off your dang finger.

We also require a background check and a three-day wait period to ensure these emojis don’t fall into the wrong hands. As an added security measure each digital weapon has a registered serial number that can be traced back to the owner.” At press time critics were calling for tighter emoji controls after a 23-year-old man sent the pistol to his entire family before texting it to nearly a dozen random strangers.

Obviously an integrated municipality-wide network of possums would consume far fewer resources and create far less waste than individual motorists. There are admittedly some downsides; in addition to passengers opossums may well carry rabies which could conceivably pose a setback. However they would partially make up for this by consuming up to two tons of ticks per day.” Development engineers are currently grappling with the fact that possums are primarily nocturnal and thus somewhat of a liability during rush hour.

If it was more of a conversation I guess it would be fine but at this point I just want to get in get out and go right back to scratching my face and licking my own butt.” At press time Jellybean let out a whimper after being led inside the dog boutique only to find the aforementioned groomer talking off the ear of a German shepherd and running an hour behind schedule.

It’s this sort of finding that almost makes one feel bad for bitching out one of these baristas for forgetting to add whipped cream to one’s caffè mocha.” Wells added that unfortunately many of the most impressive examples of such barista communication have been destroyed due to human activity and consumption.

For example my colleagues from Montana gave a sterling presentation about the advantages of putting out your lit Marlboro right between some goon’s eyes and then slamming a shot glass down on his head. It’s exhilarating and frankly I can’t wait to put some of these discoveries into application on the first dickless fuck who looks at me the wrong way.” At press time the Sturgis Symposium had had briefly adjourned after a brawl broke out between 50000 attendees intent on conducting field research.

The inmate experiences only mild discomfort for a few short seconds while the pressure creates pockets of air under their skin—unless of course the executioner is using a hand pump in which case it may be a few minutes before the prisoner is sufficiently inflated enough to rupture.” Federal officials added that despite the potential risks it was a much more merciful method than lethal implosion.

We have it on good authority that some of these guys were moving through the city at speeds of 80 mph. Darkening the sky and creating powerful displays of thunder and lightning is nothing but a fear tactic. And of course they’re now going to expect us to help repair the damage they’ve inflicted on their own communities.” At press time Brown had also condemned antifa members in rural Illinois for sucking up cows into the sky and shooting them 100 feet through the air.

Murray commending agents for quickly springing into action to interrupt the briefing and neutralize the threat of the president not getting to see a guy get shot in front of his eyes. “Of course ensuring the president has a front-row seat to our agents mowing down a guy in the Rose Garden is Secret Service protocol but we don’t always see it put into action unfortunately. It was an incredibly stressful moment especially trying to usher him into position but I was so relieved to see that big smile on the president’s face. There have been some close calls over President Trump’s tenure especially in Lafayette Square back in June so we’re just glad we were able to get him out there yesterday in time to watch the whole thing unfold.” The Secret Service also confirmed that they had taken the additional step of sequestering Vice President Mike Pence at an unspecified remote location during the threat so that he could watch the agents shoot someone through a telescope.

Even if your star-crossed lover is separated by oceans or mountains we have been able to prove on a consistent basis that trembling at the thought of reuniting can’t even be put in the same category as bumping uglies all damn night long.” Patel added that their preliminary research has also suggested that pining for your sweetheart’s return doesn’t even compare to a quickie in a public park.

Hell normally I’d be too shy to ask Daisy Duck for her autograph but today I thought ‘What the heck’ you know? Live for today.” Reeves concluded that he sincerely hoped his 4-year-old felt the same way.

I would have definitely spoken out against the forced subjugation of Black people in the 1950s even. You can disagree with me if you want or say that I wouldn’t have actually been against it back then but if I were alive in the 1960s I would know in my heart that slavery was wrong. Does that make me brave? Maybe.” Leigh added that he’s equally sure he would be against the concept of forced prison labor if he’s still alive in the 2070s.

They have created an enviable system that cannot be compromised by hackers counterfeit mail-in ballots or in-person tampering. Thus they never have to worry about the results of an election being called into question. No doubt there is much we can learn from Bolivia’s example as we work to uphold the security of our own 2020 presidential race.” At press time Wolf added that there was also a thing or two the Department of Homeland Security could learn from Bolivia’s treatment of protesters.

Although we are currently planning on a one-time delivery of these 1000-foot seagoing airbases to help Americans weather this current storm we are also leaving open the possibility of providing a second stimulus aircraft carrier down the line.” McConnell added that should Americans need to pay rent they can always sell their aircraft carriers to the Saudi government.

Hey Dave did you pick up this guy? I don’t remember grabbing him and shoving him back there. Fuck our ass is grass if we show up at headquarters with an abducted protester. Someone look online to see if anyone’s posting about him going missing. There’s only one right?

These are candidates whose unique identities have informed their experiences whether as accomplished women who have carved out careers in fields traditionally dominated by men or as men with curly waves cascading down their necks who know what it’s like to make their way in a world run by short-haired men. Rest assured my White House will reflect this nation’s great diversity of awesome looks.” At press time Biden had clarified any long-haired man selected wouldn’t be a hippie.

You wouldn’t be able to see what those mysterious beings from an alternate universe were doing to your penis but that would of course be part of the thrill.” The theoretical astro-fetishists confirmed they had recently applied for a grant that would allow them to test their hypothesis by launching perverts into a black hole penis-first.

All breakout sessions will be held in the shallow end while floor votes will be taking place in lanes 1 through 4 and as for refreshments there will be a floating beverage station with a communal glass of water for everyone to drink out of.” At press time Kemp demanded everyone stay in the water after Lt.

It happened so quickly that these once-mighty emperors and patricians likely never saw it coming.” At press time Shelangoski admitted that some scientists continued to theorize that Romans who were able to adapt to the new political climate had actually spread and flourished throughout Byzantium.

Restaurant and service workers who interact with the public on a regular basis can generally receive their injections for free and those with health insurance are covered as well with most insurers paying the full cost of the injection and up to 10% of any subsequent hospitalizations.” Pappas went on to state that if only 80 to 90% of Americans would visit these Covid-19 injection sites the pandemic would be over in weeks.

So it was a bit of a challenge to recreate that energy 17 years later and over the internet but pretty soon we got back in the swing of things and started having as much fun as ever—honestly it’s wild some of the stuff they let us get away with back then. And sure not all of it holds up but I think people will get a real nostalgia boost out of reliving one of the undisputed highlights of the early 2000s.” Rumsfeld added that thanks to a generous outpouring of support by viewers the table read had successfully raised over $20 million for The Heritage Foundation.

Plus he’s got a really kind-looking face so I bet it wouldn’t be hard to get someone to take pity on him and give him a few bucks for a motel room.” Klause went on to admit that if it turned out the missing teen had a chemical dependency or mental health issues he was pretty much fucked.

While this body will not ask what prompted her to adopt such unprofessional language it will require the representative to issue an immediate apology to her colleagues or face further disciplinary action for her misconduct.” In his own words McCarthy went on to observe that it was too soon to tell just how far back Ocasio-Cortez had set “young ladies” in Congress with her “hysterical” outburst.

Its methods may be controversial as the ball has transcended beyond the need for food and water and subsists only on breath but I am awed by the amount of mental and spiritual strength necessary for The Round One to sit in utter silent and spherical contemplation for 24 hours a day. I do not approach this undertaking lightly but I know if I truly commit myself to the methods of the ball I will be completely transformed.” Miller was last seen fleeing into the Himalayan foothills moments after a large popping sound was heard echoing throughout the monastery.

Every day valuable hospital beds are being taken up by these hired actors who feign extreme agony as part of a secret conspiracy to keep our economy from recovering. It’s making it so that people with actual deadly illnesses are now afraid of going to the hospital because the media has them terrified they might catch this fictional respiratory illness.” Officials in Florida and other states have also criticized the hoax’s participants for the breaking point recently reached by overburdened county morgues.

Yeah she was dating your dad at that point and sure we were only 17 but that didn’t stop her from flirting us all the way into Willie’s bus! Believe me when I tell you it was way messier than you’d think and it smelled a little bit of marijuana. Oh we were so bad!” At press time Aunt Dot revealed a small dolphin tattoo right above her pelvis and went on to tell the room about the crazy night in Cabo where it all went down.

Eyewitness accounts confirmed that when the ceramic pot shattered on the concrete floor the startled unmanned aerial vehicle flew into a nearby alley where it became entangled in several large copper wind chimes. According to U.S. military sources the bungling drone then bounded onto a busy thoroughfare where it bumped into a parked car and set off its alarm before wildly careening through a group of caterers and plowing into a large wedding cake. Several reports indicated that the pilotless aircraft soon realized that Taliban soldiers were in hot pursuit and attempted to hover perfectly still in an attempt to blend in alongside mannequins in a storefront window. Sources told reporters that once spotted the klutzy drone darted off toppling an entire row of motorcycles before finally making a successful escape. At press time the drone had carefully closed the hangar door before turning around to find itself nose-to-nose with the scowling Air Force base commander.

When I called the number on the poster this fuckhead was all like ‘How does she seem?’ and I said ‘Seems fine’ and he said he’d have the money ready. And now he’s crying and angry and trying to take back his promised reward?

It’s very important to keep wearing the mask for the remainder of the pandemic though or you risk losing it all. Really this is a can’t-lose proposition for any citizen smart enough to know a great deal when they see one.” Redford concluded that anyone foolish enough not to wear a mask would likely be declaring bankruptcy filing for divorce and searching out cures for sexual dysfunction by year’s end.

Sadly however all of their test rockets have immediately exploded upon exiting the atmosphere leaving the polar bears both stunned and confused.” At press time Yelnich confirmed that polar bears had begun working around the clock on space travel after Russian snow leopards successfully launched a rocket into orbit.

Frankly these protesters should be thanking us for getting rid of those frumpy jackets and unkempt beards and introducing them to their sexy exciting new selves.” Wolf also told critics that when the department finally released the protesters from their makeovers in two years they would be so fabulous that their friends and family wouldn’t even recognize them.

After the funds are deposited it’s just a simple matter of Congress collecting the initial gratuities counting them up and then tipping out to all needy Americans who can provide the necessary documentation to show they qualify.” At press time critics were arguing that the stimulus didn’t go far enough to help average Americans after a passing teenager swiped the jar.

You can only do many episodes about how Ilhan Omar is leading a cabal of minorities to install Black supremacy in the country before it begins to feel a bit stale you know? But then that Hispanic cashier tried to stiff me and didn’t apologize well enough for my liking and then I heard him speaking Spanish to a coworker as I was leaving—it was like a light bulb went off.

We know times are tough but together we will get through this pandemic.” Pelosi added that obviously lewd behavior or drug use would not be tolerated and much of the allocated funding would go towards weekly police sweeps of the overpass to ensure compliance.

Trust me no one else is going in there. These places are real pieces of shit.” Newsom concluded however that bars that serve people with healthy lives and things left to live for will be forced to close.

And hopefully soon we’ll be sipping on Rockin’ Fresh Ritas beneath a gown worn by Dolly Parton or Bon Jovi’s guitar.” Martin added that it was crucial for Americans not to let poor mental health lead them to harmful behaviors like dining at the Rainforest Cafe.

We have also discovered that owls swallow their prey whole because the drug significantly reduces their appetite.” Wheelwright added that bats’ nocturnal lifestyle on the other hand could be attributed to their penchant for methamphetamines.

You’d never know it from looking at the photo that Fox put out but this party was just one example of Epstein’s long history of providing numerous waiters to ensure guests like Bill Clinton Donald Trump Prince Andrew and Alan Dershowitz always had ample hors d’oeuvres.” Carusone added that this journalistic oversight was particularly egregious for Fox News reporters since they along with virtually everyone else in the media had attended dozens of Epstein’s get-togethers over the years.

It’s clear from the information we’ve gathered that not renewing your contract with us would have potentially devastating consequences for your bottom line especially considering that our in-depth analysis of your strategic spending indicates you need us to conduct additional analyses of your strategic spending immediately. You could also realize our heightened revenue projections by setting aside more cash for your next contract with us as 2021 is certain to bring with it new challenges for your firm and new fees from ours.” The report went on to suggest several ways the client could free up funds to spend on the consulting firm such as cutting staff benefits and laying off several dozen employees.

Not on my watch. All we had to do is send in some planes bomb a few of our bases and tell the Russians where to send the payment. Believe me no other president has handled Russia the way I have. No one.” At press time Republican lawmakers defended Trump’s decision stating that the president’s methods might be unconventional but collecting bounties placed on the heads of American troops was good for the economy.

There have also been cases in which mutated strains of Covid-19 have been documented floating in the air by chewing a large wad of gum and blowing up a big bubble or using moon shoes to bounce off the walls. This is far more dangerous than we ever could have imagined.” At press time Merz added that the researchers had discovered additional evidence that the virus could linger on surfaces for days while cruising around with its friends on inline skates.

Our analysis also shows that given how often celebrities like Ryan Gosling Selena Gomez and the Hemsworth brothers have sex they are probably incredible at it. In addition a degree of status is conferred upon anyone who has sex with a major star as they are forever known within their social group as the one who had sex with Drake or Kristen Stewart.” Mulbin added that even in the worst-case scenario in which a person contracts an incurable STI from an A-list celebrity the accompanying sexual gratification would still “totally be worth it.”

We must rise up against this government tyranny because they have no right to stop any Floridian from making the journey to the Kaaba.

Eating so many hot dogs that it makes you violently ill should be a reward unto itself.” Aveline went on to suggest that competitors like world champion eater Joey Chestnut were really more about sex appeal than artistry.

Are they happy? Sad? Old? Young? Unfortunately because so much of the nation are just total fucking randos we may never actually know.” At press time Kirkman added that the remaining 85% of Americans were basic as shit allowing researchers to easily parse every detail about their boring miserable lives.

I’m honestly surprised I’ve made it this long. Every day is such a slog. Honestly I’m at my breaking point. Biden isn’t perfect by any means but he’d certainly be an improvement. The sink doesn’t get what my deal is but obviously she doesn’t understand because she’s never been used.” At press time the White House toilet claimed to be most worried about the possibility of Trump refusing to give up the bathroom voluntarily in November.

It’s hard to get a read on crows. We haven’t even tried to place them on the avian IQ scale because they probably have all kinds of street smarts that we don’t know about and that our metrics wouldn’t be able to account for anyway.” Russo went on to state that emus however are just as goddamn stupid as they appear to be.

You cannot simply erase his escapades with Ranger Smith.” At press time the group’s leader was arguing this could all be a slippery slope to removing Yakky Doodle or Snagglepuss statues or even shaming someone for simply singing “Hey There It’s Yogi Bear” in public.

Perhaps if we stopped arguing and read up on his support for lower tariffs or his second career as chief justice of the Supreme Court in my illuminating biography Taft: Man Of Vision we could find a way forward. Right now the entire nation should be looking to Taft.” Carter added that Taft’s great quote “A man never knows exactly how the child of his brain will strike other people” rings more true today than ever.

There remains much to be studied including an unexplained phenomenon in which on Tuesdays only the signal transmits double shots of all our favorites from the Eagles and Foreigner to Eddie Money and Billy Squier.

While Sheila does enjoy our extended line of breakfast foods that is only one small facet of her rich and complex identity as a human being: Sheila also speaks fluent Italian likes U2 is bisexual and enjoys cross-country skiing.

I did think we had something special with this act though and it’s nice to see now that it really means something to so many people.

As a result we are now recommending that in any public space where one could conceivably encounter attractive people a blindfold be worn at all times.” Adhanom went on to clarify that making out was still a safe activity to participate in so long as the parties involved kept their eyes closed throughout.

Unfortunately it could be years before TV becomes a mainstream form of cultural entertainment.” At press time Andino figured it was best to start her readers on sitcoms before introducing them to more complex forms of television such as documentary miniseries.

We’re committed to publishing quips and jests from all sides of the political spectrum. Over the years we’ve published controversial cartoons from dozens of senators as well as five secretaries of defense and Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter. This crudely rendered cartoon may offend some people but we’re not in the business of silencing voices.” The New Yorker “Goings On About Town” editor similarly defended the magazine’s recommendation of several local Identity Evropa and Patriot Front rallies.

The lack of respect shown for this piece of municipal property—which had just been power-washed last week at taxpayer expense—is frankly disgraceful.

While they may appear peaceful these 75- 80- and 90-year-old men are armed with canes that could inflict serious harm as well as walkers that could be used to bludgeon. Sadly until we are provided with additional tear gas rubber bullets and armored tanks we cannot ensure that our officers are safe.” At press time Rinaldo released several photos showing “highly explosive” oxygen tanks confiscated from elderly men that morning.Here’s a list of organizations where you can donate.

We even have two units of affordable housing to satisfy city requirements in what used to be the stadium’s bathrooms. It has skylights all-new appliances and the history of decades of baseball played right where our open-plan kitchens now stand. We’re actually grateful to the Athletics that they decided to withhold rent because this is much better for us.” City authorities also informed the Athletics that their old baseball equipment that was illegally left at the facility had been seized and transferred to the Guadalupe Landfill in San Jose.

I worked hard all my life to get that ball and that large black linebacker—or maybe he was even a defensive end—ripped it out of my hands and just ran away. Meanwhile I got shoved to the ground and not only did no one intervene but the other black men around him started cheering. Where the heck was law enforcement? I could’ve been killed. It was just clear they have no respect for me the grandson of World War II veterans.

They are only deployed when an officer feels like they are in imminent danger. Sure in some cases poorly aimed tires have caused internal bleeding fractured bones or left bruises shaped like tread marks over various body parts but overall this bouncy flexible alternative is far preferable to being run over with hard metal wheels.

It’s disgusting to put workers at risk by looting. You do it by chipping away at their health benefits and eventually laying them off. There’s a right way and wrong way to do this.” At press time critics recommended that protestors hold law enforcement accountable by simply purchasing the Minneapolis police department from taxpayers.

Frankly was the mainstream media going to accept any number of mass casualties without pouncing on it as an excuse to scrutinize the commander in chief’s decision making? I somehow doubt it.” McEnany went on to emphasize that such biased coverage conveniently ignored the hundreds of millions across the country whom the president’s actions had left alive.

After all if you keep fixating on the little problems you’ll never be ready for that moment when you finally figure enough’s enough with fighting against all of life’s pressures and frustrations and just let the whole disappointing world steamroll over you.” Leonard added that she had learned these lessons from her great grandmother who used her crushing experience living through the Great Depression and Spanish Flu to entirely give up on living by her early 30s.

If our officers are going to be out in the field kneeing people in the neck over and over again that’s a repeat-use injury just waiting to happen and we must address it. We need to ensure all of our officers know how to act in a more dangerous situation where they may be required to lift with their backs.” The Minneapolis Police Department added that normally they would place the involved officer on desk duty but in this case they didn’t want to risk causing further damage to his knees.

It’s very sad and hard to imagine what I’ve been going through. Each of these departed Americans leaves behind family and friends and it is deeply upsetting to think that they could claim I was responsible.” Trump closed his remarks by urging the nation to come together in finding a different scapegoat to pin this all on.

And while we expect the complete obliteration of a person’s former identity to primarily affect adults we know that there could be mysterious disappearances of children as young as 12.” Xi Jinping went on to recommend that Hong Kong residents do their part to defend against the second wave of coronavirus by swearing absolute fealty to the Chinese government.

We want our vaccine campaign to strike the right tone—serious but not too serious maybe something like Bud Light did with ‘dilly dilly’ some kind of catchphrase that everyone across the country will quickly remember. We know how badly people want a coronavirus vaccine which is why we need to pull out all the stops to make it as memorable and entertaining for consumers as possible. It’s just unfortunate when an advertising campaign isn’t as easy as finding the cure.” Bourla added that Pfizer’s main worry was unveiling their coronavirus vaccine ad campaign before Johnson & Johnson or GlaxoSmithKline debuted their marketing.

It could be argued that producer Robert Zemeckis is one of the great minor villains of global warming since were this film never made we would be in an ever so slightly better position to preserve our environment.” The report concluded that the manufacturing of promotional apparel for Mars Needs Moms could be the worst fractional climate disaster of its kind surpassed only by the release of toys commemorating the 2004 CGI adaptation of Curious George.

At the end of the day we need to set aside our differences and realize that we are all Americans who never want that to happen to us—a bone just jutting out like that especially while trying to run away from lava. I can’t believe it’s already been 40 years since that movie came out.” At press time the nation was reportedly at bitter odds again after one American mistook Dante’s Peak for the other 1997 disaster movie Volcano starring Tommy Lee Jones.

This is one of the most deadly substances mankind has ever produced even algae can’t survive. Hundreds of miles out to sea we have spotted deformed dolphins with three flippers and whole blooms of obese jellyfish. Even an emergency order of 10 billion breadsticks has been unable to reverse the damage.” Novell added that volunteers have only been able to clean seabirds covered in the alfredo sauce by burning it off with the highly acidic and abrasive Olive Garden marinara.

While the perp appears to have been completely unarmed at the time of his head exploding we can report with certainty that the individual in question had been picked up several times in the past for suspicion of marijuana possession.” Shea added that due to malfunctioning body cameras they were unlikely to ever fully solve the mystery of how the deceased suspect’s body came to have an additional 15 rounds fired into it.

This is an important next step in authorizing the vast majority of illegal FBI operations on the internet the same way we did with searching on telephones. The men and women of the FBI are just trying to do their jobs yet have had to operate under conditions where they collect private information and search Americans’ private data while fearing for their careers. These long-overdue reforms should increase the FBI’s productivity since agents won’t have to waste so much time covering their trails or dealing with the occasional lawsuit. Finally the restrictive measures of previous internet-related legislation will no longer be the circumvented law of the land.” McConnell expressed hope that the remaining 20% of FBI operations not legalized through the expanded Patriot Act would be addressed in an upcoming bill.

It takes a lot of work carefully building up my girth and stamina to peak right when competitions happen. It’s not like I can keep up this level of flab on my frame in the long term.

Several reports indicated that while early messages under the clip such as “Remembering better days” or “Than you John Cougar for this Incredible ANTHEM song [sic]” set a nearly insurmountable standard of pitifulness their subtle pathos was quickly outdone by the later statements of YouTube user Celtics_76 who described a wife who had “loved this song” and how the rhythm guitar riff “still makes me think of her even 7 years later. RIP Julia.” Additional analysis suggested that while the simple note “Fuck cancer” hinted at a possible capstone to the mountain of sadness evoked by viewers of the heartland rock song such speculation was ultimately rendered premature when user Petty_Tomorrow jumped into the fray to ask “who loves this song comment me if you do” igniting a minor storm of absolutely heartrending subcomments suggesting personal disability family trauma and an almost unspeakable longing for the years that have passed since the song’s July 1982 debut. At press time further information confirmed that the escalating trend had fortunately come to an end after John Mellencamp’s verified account posted “Personally I think it still holds up—What do you guys think?” in the video’s comments.

As such we recommend those who experience such phenomena drink a glass of water and try to calm down a bit before taking their next dose.” Paradoxically the study found that if your skin bones and entire body melt completely into the earth and you and all the matter in the universe become indistinguishable parts of the same cosmic dance then you are about to have the best goddamn experience of your life.

It doesn’t have to be the novel coronavirus either. I’d take influenza measles—for the love of God at least give me a cold or a staph infection to neutralize.” At press time reports confirmed Dutton’s immune system had begun attacking normal healthy tissue just to break the monotony.

Until then we must bid you farewell noble spirit.” At press time reports confirmed Paulson’s roommate had arrived home for lunch and popped the frozen pizza in the oven.

However we deeply apologize for any who have lost a loved one whether through differential pressure crushing their skull or simply being jettisoned into the unfathomable depths of space.” Agency administrators admitted this was the worst terrestrial airlock accident since 1969's Apollo 11 mission when rapid depressurization catapulted the Saturn V rocket out of the Earth’s atmosphere and directly to the surface of the Moon.

States shouldn’t be left out to dry putting together piecemeal pandemic responses. What else is a strong Communist Party for? And now they’re trying to cover it up claiming the U.S. isn’t their responsibility.” At press time Trump added the administration had obtained new intelligence suggesting the Chinese government had engineered coronavirus in a lab in Washington.

And fact eight is ‘There’s still a lot we don’t know about slugs’ which is just objectively untrue. Honestly they probably should have just stopped at five or six slug facts.

Matt Gaetz (R-FL) in a sarcasm-tinged screed that echoed thousands of others posts and messages delivered from conservative surrogates and Congress members predicated on the fact that both Republicans and Democrats dismiss the significance of testimony from women about misconduct assault and outright rape in order to achieve their political goals. “What’s interesting is that Democrats have always billed themselves as so high and mighty on this issue and yet they’ve just proven themselves to be as cynically power-hungry as us! For example they’re dismissing the allegations against Biden because they want to progress their agenda just the way millions of religious conservatives have ceased to care about the current president’s history of unsettling sexual behavior for the exact same reasons. It’s so rich! We’re all total sacks of shit!” Conservative commentators also pointed out the rank hypocrisy of liberals crassly using past allegations to their political advantage the way Republicans themselves are currently doing.

We’re doing a fantastic job containing the virus but sadly some governors are stooping so low as to fake their numbers—not only with blacks but with people born in other countries too.

That is why we suggest going back to the way things were and simply forgetting that axolotls exist at all.” At press time Fritzk added that it was best not to think about the fact that this deadly virus probably existed and was already coming to finish us all off.

It didn’t care if you were a horseshoe mouse-tailed or Kitti’s hog-nosed bat; it was open for business. This bat would pretty much hook up with any mammal with wings. And we’re not trying to slut-shame I swear. We just think the public deserves to know the facts.” At press time the nation’s top epidemiologist had issued an apology to the bat after discovering the outbreak actually originated from a rather loose pangolin.

But then I thought honestly what else am I doing with my time holed up in the papal apartment? So I kept at it and man I’m glad I did. Once you get to all the Gospels and the whole Jesus-God twist it’s just a total page-turner. I probably only have a few hundred more pages and then this thing is in the bag.” Francis admitted that reading the Bible now made him regret skipping to the Quran years ago and spoiling so much of the story.

By the time we arrived however all we found was a pile of discarded candy wrappers and a sorry crew of tubby frosting-covered scamps who were rolling around on the storehouse floor as they clutched their protruding bellies. To make matters worse they are at present still asking for more dessert.” While Ehlers confirmed the naughty boys deserved a spanking she went on to admit she could not stay mad at those adorable chubby-cheeked faces for long.

We’ve all seen the reports and it’s simply not right to ignore the fact that humans could easily live to 400 or 500 years old if we didn’t force them into such terrible conditions. While they may not be as intelligent as we are recent studies suggest that the smartest adult humans can have the intelligence of a 4-attosecond-old speck so we don’t know how we can just float here eating human meat and thinking there’s nothing wrong with it. Just because they’re not intelligent enough to understand the reality of their situation doesn’t mean they aren’t deserving of our compassion. These unintelligent creatures believe they’re burying their dead when in fact every crematorium and graveyard is funneled straight to us for food and pleasure. It’s not right. That’s not even mentioning the health risks that human meat can cause coming as it does from an abattoir planet rife with disease.” Critics of PERHST2-K and other animal rights groups took to social media to say that intergalactic beings had been eating humans throughout their history and that alternative versions to human meat lacked the taste and bloody consistency of the real thing.

Whether used as a supplement to breastfeeding or as a substitute for it this ass-burning formula gives mothers a bold new option for testing their infants’ abilities to test spices and withstand pain. We guarantee that this’ll get even the most daring newborn shitting flames and crying tears of mercy in no time.” Reached for comment the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that infants with a flair for risk skip the ghost pepper formula and instead try Gerber’s new baby food made with real deadly nightshade berries.

We had a lot of fun in those days. No one believed we would innovate and become far more deadly and brutal than all the other  Salafi jihadists but that’s exactly what we did. Ha I remember how the neighbors used to complain about all the noise from the screaming sex slaves and the beheadings! We’d just laugh.” Al-Qurashi added that the garage experience was ultimately what inspired ISIS to start similar terror-cell incubators in at least 18 countries around the world.

Of course we understand that no one is happy about this situation but millions of people will have to contend with the reality that their Christmas tree may be shrunken and their presents few but there’s love abounding for all hearts that are true. Certainly no one wants to find out that what’s really important is love and having people to share it with.” At press time concerns about holiday-season shortages had increased after reports from around the country that thousands of Americans were already attempting to stockpile that magic Christmas feeling.

Am I disappointed by the inadequacy of this administration’s foreign policy initiatives or am I disappointed by the inadequacy I feel about myself? Because with the way things are going these days I might rate my own life at about 45%.” Wade added that his low expectations for Biden could also be an emotional survival strategy that dated  back to his childhood and reflected five decades of being let down by presidents.

It appears now that the moniker ‘Ted Bundy’ was a subtle reference to his actual identity Ted Bundy—a connection we were able to make thanks to the tireless work of our dedicated teams of agents across the U.S. who stopped at nothing to solve this case.” Although they were able to close the book on Bundy the FBI later reminded Americans that they were still hunting down the killer known as “Jeffrey Dahmer” and pleaded for any tips that could potentially lead to an ID on the notorious perpetrator.

Fuck them. I thought Mensa might be a nice group of people to hang around with but if this is the way they’re going to be then forget it. I don’t want to be friends with a bunch of smug assholes. And if they like ridiculously strict admission requirements well I’ve got one of my own for them: Nobody in Mensa gets into heaven. How do you like that you elitist pricks?” According to heavenly sources God’s disappointment was assuaged somewhat when He reminded Himself that He already belonged to some perfectly good civic organizations and that next Thursday Mitch Albom would be speaking at Rotary Club.

There’s eight of them sharing one bed and not to be rude but a lot of them look like they haven’t washed their hands in a long time. Some look really young too and while they may not be showing symptoms they could still spread the disease to more vulnerable people. Seriously where are those kids’ parents?” At press time Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced it would begin strict enforcement of the CDC’s social-distancing guidelines by moving each of the migrants into solitary confinement.

The reality is no matter how good your food is that first time someone gets arrested or slapped with a $10000 fine for trying to eat at your establishment can destroy you.” At press time Coleman advised restaurant owners to raise at least $10 million to $15 million in additional funding if they wanted to survive the next year.

All of this would confirm centuries of folktales and legends about these monstrous tricksters in a way that could frankly transform how humanity understands the physical world. I mean Jesus Christ—goblins. Honestly the fact that I have a few of them locked up in a cage in my office alone would probably make me one of the most influential scientists in human history. But we want this to get the airtime it deserves and there’s this whole Covid-19 problem so...I guess we’ll just wait?

We’ve also restricted visitation privileges for all inmates suspected of engaging in coronavirus vaccine R&D as we now know many visitors have smuggled in tools that have been used to build improvised chromatography chambers.” At press time sources reported that guards on Rikers had become frustrated after the entire prison population became immune thanks to the bootleg vaccine achieving a 100% efficacy rate.

I’ve also issued an executive order to divert food supplies to the Hamptons so that residents will have enough to serve all their guests at their weekend parties.

In this time of crisis we must do everything we can to ensure that all wealthy New Yorkers have access to the basic luxuries they need.” At press time MSNBC pundits were praising Cuomo’s handling of the crisis commenting that his drive to help the wealthy no matter what it cost made him seem very presidential.

However our data revealed a marked decrease in public trust if the beaker falls to the ground explodes and burns a hole through the floor.” The study also found that the vast majority of Americans believed that they would receive accurate information from a child in an oversized lab coat and goggles.

Millions of Americans speak to each other as if they once saw Dr. Fauci in a one-on-one interview on CNN when in reality what they saw was Jake Tapper talking to an empty chair for nearly six minutes.

Pecking shitting chirping flying; you name it and birds will continue doing it unaffected by the virus that has brought our lives to a grinding halt.

Frankly if it weren’t for the resurgence of Bengal tigers and polar bears on Staten Island I think we’d be seeing a lot more of them.” At press time the white rhino had once again been classified as an endangered species after a single New York City resident left his apartment to go pick up some paper towels at a local 7-Eleven.

Who knows maybe we’ll even execute them.” At press time Fox News broadcasters had been granted a stay of removal by a federal judge.

We’ve got all this cash coming in from cornering almost every market and forcing people unwilling to leave their homes to buy from us and I can’t imagine a better use for it at this critical time but to stuff as many people as we can possibly fit into a poorly ventilated warehouse and see how long they’ll tolerate the pain and discomfort for 10 bucks an hour. It’s like what else are they gonna do? We’re in the middle of a pandemic and as a business responsible to shareholders Amazon is going to do whatever we need to do to sit back and enjoy watching people suffer from the coronavirus. And if this trial run pans out we’re considering expanding this crammed-employee program to markets across the country.” At press time Bezos added that the company was offering anyone who signed up for an Amazon Prime subscription a free live video feed to watch the employees.

The only reason we wait tables serve drinks and brew your coffee is to avoid becoming totally disillusioned with our vast wealth.

Bars and restaurants all across the nation are closing but with just one serotonin-reducing dose patients won’t want to leave home anyway. And as a positive side effect patients won’t care that there’s a global pandemic raging worldwide since we’re all staring down the same dull endless tunnel.” Barnett revealed that the company was also developing dozens of expensive drugs to help manage the effects of the hyper-depressants.

Seriously there’s nothing to be afraid of people; all you need to do is find some spineless coward who will just give you a thumbs up and say ‘looks good’ regardless of your symptoms.” Trump later continued the address by promising all Americans that enlisting the help of doctors like these will be free and easy under his newly proposed healthcare plan.

If you don’t need it right now you could just put it in a drawer with all your other cords. Something to think about anyway.

Sadly after that 100% of newborns end up exiting the womb only to end up devastated when they are not allowed to eat solid foods for six more months.” At press time researchers had published an addendum to the study which found that the average time in labor could be reduced to just 30 minutes if mothers opted to give birth next to a freshly roasted turkey.

After taking some time to examine the 44th president’s golden death mask more closely we discovered it was actually brass and had only been cast a few weeks ago.

It’s nearly impossible for students from low-income households who are not 45-year-old men carrying slingshots to compete.

And the whole apparatus is easily and cheaply recharged with commercially available bananas.” Neutrogena’s advanced maintenance kit which contains a bullwhip a tranquilizer gun and a net will be sold separately.

So yeah just focus on the coronavirus thing because that’s what’s really important. We believe the disease originated in Wuhan China and I am almost certain that my hemorrhoids most likely originated from my straining because I’ve been on the toilet so much due to my IBS although now that I think about it you probably don’t need to be hearing about that so just forget it.” At press time the press conference hit the 120 minute mark as Harirchi became distracted talking about a rash on his groin and his erectile dysfunction problems while trying to outline the government strategy for combating the virus.

I am aware there were a few incidents in 2017 and I figured that since obviously I wouldn’t have heard of every instance it probably went as far back as 2014. But 1990? I’m a little embarrassed I don’t mind telling you. Well at least now that we know it’s going on. We can address it so it should be pretty much over by the end of the year.” Owens added that he took some small comfort in the knowledge that his mother’s generation never had to deal with something like this.

This is still a great deal. But in the face of what we know now it seems highly implausible that these are drastic and urgent sales. In fact I would go so far as to suggest there is nothing spontaneous about these savings at all. You might even say this should be called a ‘highly premeditated and meticulously planned effort’ sale.

Striding past hardened infectious agents in a subterranean prison deep beneath CDC headquarters the director appeared shaken as he endured the maniacal laughter of cholera and the blood-curdling screams of tuberculosis. The CDC director reportedly withstood a series of menacing taunts from diphtheria which was heard whispering sardonically about how quickly it could replicate itself inside Redfield’s cells. According to reports Redfield spoke through an intercom to address avian strain H5N1 which is kept in solitary confinement in a hermetically sealed room. In exchange for insight into how the new coronavirus might be planning to turn itself into a devastating worldwide pandemic Redfield is believed to have offered the highly pathogenic flu accommodations in a larger more comfortable vial as well as special privileges that would allow it to spend part of the day in an open-air petri dish. At press time sources confirmed the facility had entered full lockdown after a guard discovered avian flu had seduced and killed the CDC director in order to escape.

We commend our ambitious goals for other countries—France for instance is going carbon-neutral by 2022 and we’re especially gratified to see that China under the terms of this agreement will involuntarily offset all of America’s carbon emissions which will be able to go up dramatically under this agreement. The Washington pact shows that if we Americans put our mind to it there’s nothing we can’t compel other countries to do.” U.S. officials added that the plan would likely cause significant issues and economic hardship in emerging economies but under the terms of the agreement they didn’t care.

Crisis W.E.B. Du Bois’ war zeppelin. “Looking at this afro-futurist combat dirigible evokes images of W.E.B.

After that point rather than learning a healthy respect for death children become numb to it in many cases even begin actively seeking the power associated with it.” At this point in the study Franklin could neither confirm nor deny that substituting of the children’s aging grandparents might be more effective.

In fact our internal studies show that in recent generations many young Catholic men have decided against becoming priests because they knew it meant they would never be able to marry the pope.” At press time a visibly beleaguered Pope Francis quickly announced another doctrinal change that for the first time in church history would allow members of the Catholic faith to get divorced.

You’ll need to have all your wits about you if you intend to stay one step ahead of its wicked grasp. You never know when it could creep silently behind you and infect you from the rear which is why the CDC recommends that in addition to wearing a face mask on the back of your head you always sit facing the entrance of any room you’re in with your back to the wall. We also strongly caution all Americans to look at any mirror they pass by in case the coronavirus is trying to trail them and also to wear another face mask on top of your head to shield against aerial attacks.” CDC officials also recommended singing loudly wearing strings of bells around your neck or frequently blowing an air horn in an effort to scare off any coronavirus that might be lingering nearby.

So go outside and eat handfuls of grass and dirt if you’d like. Or just keep your mouth open and see what lands in it. When you’re eating that much you’re bound to run into some vitamins by chance eventually.” The nutritionists then reiterated that Americans should try to limit themselves to three meals day unless of course they’re rather have four or five or 15 because obviously no one fucking cares anymore.

And what’s wrong with giving people something they like? Many of our viewers are getting on in years and I think they find solace in familiar characters and story arcs even if they do tend to be a little derivative of the president’s Twitter account.” Peterson’s went on to confirm that he doesn’t often watch his network’s programming at home preferring to spend his free time watching the news instead.

This thing has really good auto-focus a 20x zoom and a little sun icon right on the camera which is perfect because that’s what we’re shooting. It can hold a ton of pictures too so we can just set the countdown timer and we’ll check what we got in a couple of years. Sure the Nikon is a little pricey but you don’t need to be a professional to take great pictures. It’s nice because the camera is pretty much idiot proof.” At press time NASA engineers were panicking after realizing that they had forgotten to remove the lens cap.

At one point we were fairly certain that we had found an outbreak but it turned out the passengers’ profuse sweating and pallid skin were a result of them having to walk up a flight of stairs when the ship’s elevator was out of order.” Azar added that the HHS had determined that the bloated skin dehydration and prolonged vomiting experienced by American cruise ship passengers had nothing whatsoever to do with the coronavirus.

In today’s world there’s no longer any need to consult your coworkers or friends of friends. Just swipe your finger across your phone and voila—you have access to a whole crop of strangers your age kayaking and documenting the occasion with photos.” Yoon added that the proliferation of these apps has also greatly destigmatized the once-shameful process of finding out about everyone kayaking.

And what’s worse by the time these children find themselves on a dinner platter with an apple shoved in their mouths it’s already too late.” While McGowen emphasized that there was no quick fix to this epidemic he advised children to leave a trail of breadcrumbs wherever they go just in case.

It’s truly fascinating to see the cultural constants at work here since before this discovery we believed Ladies’ Night originated in the Mycenaean culture in the 15th century B.C.E.” The same dig site has also yielded several tablets depicting the earliest known observance of Taco Tuesdays.

I used to stash all My Zippos and rolling papers under those mountains back there and just rock out. Good times. I suppose it is a little embarrassing to see how into Vince Neil I was but hey I was just a kid back then. I didn’t know any better. In my defense I got super into Slayer and Megadeth just after this.” At press time His Holiness was using a 4-track to finally record the demo album He had always planned on releasing.

I was hoping to learn about sustainable development strategies but nope—just to pad out my schedule for the week I had to sign up for a symposium on countries with loopholes in their laws allowing you to drink the blood of children during satanic rituals.” At press time Issacson was reportedly sprinting back and forth between panels on “Pedophilia In The Global Economy” and “Human Trafficking In The #MeToo Era.”

When you hear a beeping noise or see a small red light flashing beneath the skin of your pelvic region you’ll know you’ve found it.” The app also reportedly includes a self-destruct feature that immediately detonates any tampon deemed to have migrated beyond any reasonable hope of retrieval.

It sucks because I’m hemorrhaging money on upkeep and at this point I’m not even sure I can recoup my costs. I’ve tried hitting up my connections in Abu Dhabi and Bangladesh and offering her at a huge discount but no one not even the sweatshop people has expressed any interest.” Prokopyev added that he was considering reaching out to his friends in the organ-harvesting industry to see if she could at least be scrapped for parts.

But then you realize they’re tucked inside an 18-minute multi-movement song with lyrics about witches and it’s unclear exactly what Yes was even going for let alone whether this is good music. At the same time the band has been together for more than 50 years now and if they were bad surely they would have called it quits long ago. Right?” While research into Yes remains inconclusive Loach noted that his team long ago uncovered hard scientific evidence definitively proving that Emerson Lake and Palmer sucks.

Any object qualifies; let us know what you have whether it’s a pine 2-by-4 or an 8.5-by-11-inch sheet of copier paper.

I can tell you this much though: There is no goddamn way I’m letting the son I sent to die for humanity’s sin throw away His life like this.” At press time He Who Commanded the Light to Shine Forth From The Darkness went on to note that He would be changing His will in the next few days just in case His son disobeyed His wishes.

It takes a lot of willpower to deny yourself a once-in-a-lifetime sexual experience with a stranger who would never blab to your significant other but in the end it’s probably best to stick to your principles. Probably.” Burch added that as always oral sex does not count as full-on cheating so you should feel perfectly comfortable exploring those encounters and not telling your partner about them after.

But the whole litter is healthy and happy and we’ll soon be able to adopt them out to other states.

There’s even an optional pink plastic survival knife that can be used to pretend to whittle wooden stakes and spears so girls as young as four can develop intimidation soft skills even when they’re not actively assembling a trap. We at Hasbro believe that girls are just as able to subsist in The Burned Land as boys.” Hasbro plans to eventually expand the line to include food canning kits an E-Z Fry fingerprint-burning chemistry set and a picture book titled The Princesses’ Guide To Burying Gold Bullion.

They really make them out to be quite appetizing in the text—I mean the brand is even called ‘Temptations’—which is a little suspect since it’s not like my cat is going to be reading this.” At press time Petrakis said “Fuck it” and popped a handful of the cat treats in his mouth.

Compared to that a kid speaking in a deep voice as crimson light pours from his eyes is fairly trivial even if he does get his hands on the grown-up scissors.” Artaraz has reportedly taken some small inspiration from common news stories featuring young children who have managed to find firearms in their mother’s purses with what the demon called “glorious results.”

We recommend starting with a list of your 10 closest friends and ranking aspects of their professional personal and romantic lives on a scale of 1 through 10 compared to your own.” Hadley added that the report found that anyone who relies on their inner resources for a sense of worth and self-confidence is probably a total loser.

Every day we read our work aloud and take turns talking out our asses before sitting in on lectures from people who have barely sold 10000 copies in their whole careers. They helped me figure out how to make my characters more two-dimensional and the best way to build out my story arc so it’s more convoluted.” Duncan added that she was eager to take all the inane toothless critiques she’d received and turn them into something unreadable.

I’m most excited to just jump really high in the air leaping from crater to crater. Who knows? Perhaps I’ll get that old lunar roving vehicle running again and cruise around.” At press time the Dalai Lama added that depending on how things went his spirit may also spend a few days at the bottom of the ocean searching for “those weird-ass-looking fish.”

But have I gotten a single thank-you? Nope. It’s not fair! Seriously who else has come even close to having the level of influence I’ve had on #MeToo?” Weinstein went on to tell reporters that they’d better not mention Les Moonves whom he described as a “hack” who lacked the simple foresight required to cover his tracks by hiring elite highly trained ex-spies to intimidate his victims.

Some of them have been in nonstop rotation since the late 1980s; there are few crumple zones or crash restraints inside even the most whimsical magical cat; and the aggressive behavior of cat buses in traffic is usually overlooked due to the perceived importance of say getting children to their dying mother’s bedside or what have you. The city should really adopt the junior witch rideshare program they use in Kyoto. Commuters would gladly pay more to take a daily magical journey through the sky if it meant I could get to work on time for once.” Tokyo officials are advising commuters to take the train out of the city in the evening instead and have assured hesitant riders that all rail lines have been fully fumigated after last year’s infestation of No-Faces.

When it came time to actually do it I just shut my eyes pressed the blade up to my scrunchie and started frantically hacking away until I was free. I was in shock when the rescue team found me but they airlifted me to a stylist and I don’t remember much after that. I’m just so happy to survive but I was heartbroken when they told me they couldn’t reattach the ponytail.” Gaines told reporters she intends to become an advocate for people living with short hair following tragedies.

When other people would talk about how great Jackson Pollock is we just nodded in agreement even though we didn’t really get it but now we can see that he was really talented. It makes a lot more sense why we had to learn about him in school and why his paintings are on display in all those big important museums.” At press time the nation was struggling to comprehend the newest piece of blurry nonsense Chuck Close had just debuted.

We are absolutely sick and tired of this entitled girl constantly lecturing us about how it’s our fault that 80% of animal species are dead and the oceans are scalding to the touch and that if we don’t act now we’ll doom her generation to eating each other just to stay alive.

We really clicked on an emotional level too. Some might think it’s demeaning to serve as another’s muse but for Me there’s something incredibly romantic about the relationship. When I look at the final product every stroke of the painting every tiny detail evokes the flame that burned in his heart for Me. I mean those two fingers you see touching in the painting? That was our thing in bed.” God went on to note that all of this made it especially hard to have to kill Michelangelo a mere half century later.

While we had no idea it was a serial sex offender we take full responsibility and have begun the process of reaching out to the many victims it has left across an 8000-mile stretch of the North Pacific.” WWF officials also stated they had partnered with Japanese whalers to ensure the humpback pedophile would immediately be hunted down and run through with a harpoon.

Besides all we ever do is sit around and make small talk about our everlasting lives.

And it’s not like a Tylenol epidemic would be as bad as one for harder drugs. Unless people start taking lots and lots of them to still get the positive effects which would be very lucrative for us—but I can’t think that way. There’s a whole market that’s untapped here that’s for sure. We’d just have to put a lot of money into research that says there are no downsides and then really increase our marketing to doctors so it’s the first thing they suggest. And then people would get real relief from painful headaches—surely that’s a reasonable tradeoff for me adding a few million to my annual salary? Maybe if we can get teens to start grinding Tylenol up and snorting it Tylenol could become a popular teen drug and if we kick things off in the Rust Belt no one will even notice for decades. Oh stop it Alex you’ve gone over this and you know it’ll never work. But it sure is nice to dream.” Gorsky added that while the recent lawsuits brought against opioid manufacturers gave him pause he figured any punishment from a Tylenol epidemic would be decades down the road and he’d be able to cash out by then.

Yesterday I got so tweaked on bath salts trying to stay up and finish a paper that I totally forgot about my calculus study group and our usual Sunday night rainbow party. High school is a lot of pressure no matter how much Klonopin you take.” Almdell went on to say that due to her numerous academic and extracurricular commitments she has hardly had time for her relationship with her AP literature teacher much less for getting to know the married couple she has been sleeping with for the past week.

Just like any political leader the prime minister deserves a right to exist in peace free from fear of laws. It is incumbent on us as Americans to extend protection to the most vulnerable among us and for the world to recognize that an attack on Netanyahu is an attack on all of us.” At press U.S. military forces in the area had been instructed to keep an eye on potential hotbeds of resistance for anti-Netanyahu forces such as courtrooms law firms and public records offices.

It’s shocking to think Tyson was going to ship that out to supermarkets across the country.” Franklin added that if her team found more raw chicken upon their follow-up inspection next week Tyson would have to be shut down.

We plan to expand our investigation by passing around the binoculars maybe snap some pictures and hope they’re not too grainy.

At this point the vast majority of Americans can only recall the names of a couple dozen cities where the deadliest shootings have taken place. While this isn’t exactly what was intended when critics argued we should stop giving a platform to perpetrators of large-scale gun violence we nonetheless appear to be achieving this end.” The report also noted that the readership of online manifestos penned by mass shooters has decline by more than 95% over the past decade.

We believe these actions likely had a huge effect on the reception of the book allowing the senior Hemingway to essentially purchase prestige in order to buy his son’s way into the literary canon.” Gupta added that there was also evidence that praise for The Old Man And The Sea was due to Hemingway planting paid reviews in a number of expatriate-friendly media outlets.

There are far too many oaks and beeches still competing for sunlight and water well into their 900s. If seedlings show just a little foresight now they’ll be able to have the peace of mind that comes with having a solid photosynthesis plan.” Bevalacqua added that trees should be prepared to set aside even greater levels of phosphorus in their leaves and branches if they were planning on having seeds.

Then hopefully the stampede of hungry and expectant onlookers will scare your attacker off leaving you safe and sound. Yelling “Get your fresh-baked long johns here” or “There’s still a few jelly ones left” will improve the public’s response time even more. Of course once people realize you were lying about the donuts you run the risk of them angrily turning on you so be careful.” McMillan added that women should always carry a spare donut in their purse to throw at an assailant before running in the opposite direction for help.

We weren’t paying that close attention since it’s you know bumper cars so we don’t exactly know how it happened but we’re pretty sure he didn’t follow any of the rules.

For that reason we’re asking any passengers who had contact with him as he burned alive—whether it was brushing past his smoldering body or touching a nearby armrest that had burst into flames—to report to authorities immediately for an inspection.” Authorities went on to recommend that any residents who feel even a trace of burning douse themselves in water to prevent the outbreak’s rapid spread.

I’ve been crashing on my husband’s couch all week his new wife is starting to get annoyed and my back is killing me. I’m ready to ascend to paradise again.” When contacted for comment heavenly sources entreated blessed souls to please stop trying to get through the gas-proof plastic sheet tenting around the Pearly Gates.

I’m worried that may have been a lot of empty talk to make Americans feel better. We’ve always said that if we were able to lower wages and get a lower tax rate we could do it but I just don’t think I’m going to.” Hackett added that even more upsetting than the lack of good-paying job opportunities returning to the United States was the fact that he would face zero consequences for his inaction.

Coastal elites like Bugs Bunny might be okay with that outcome but true Americans will never stand for it.” LaPierre added that the NRA would be issuing an “A” rating to Marvin the Martian for providing a sterling example of a responsible ray gun owner.

Upon entry the station’s 500 security cameras will automatically capture high-definition photographs and videos of travellers and send them directly to the nearest precinct to be referenced against arrest records. A mix of plainclothes police and SWAT officers will also be on hand to help detain and interrogate anyone trying to ride for free. We hope to completely eliminate fare dodgers by adding decoy stations throughout the city.” At press time Langdon added that to cover costs for this pilot program the MTA would be closing 472 stations.

Kennedy’s historic visit. “There has always been an air of negativity surrounding President Kennedy’s Dallas trip but the overwhelming feeling among Texans seems to be that one little hiccup shouldn’t overshadow all the good things that happened that day” said museum docent Thomas Worth who along with his staff centered the Otherwise Nice Day In Dallas exhibit around photos of a smiling President Kennedy disembarking from Air Force One; the original permits for the motorcade properly filled out in excellent penmanship; and several examples of handcrafted signs and banners carried by the president’s supporters along his route across Dealey Plaza. “Of course Zapruder’s grainy hand-held 8mm film gets all the attention but we have lots of archival footage of that day which clearly shows a smiling crowd having a great time watching the progress of Kennedy’s limousine. People forget what a beautiful Texas fall day the 22nd of November was in 1963 so historians have concluded that the ride itself was likely very pleasant. Despite what we freely admit are some black marks on the calendar we mustn’t forget how the president had written a very fine speech that he wished to deliver that day right here at the Dallas Trade Mart.” Visitors to the Otherwise Nice Day In Dallas exhibit have praised the central display an interactive diorama of the Dallas highway system demonstrating how the president’s car was able to get to Parkland Memorial Hospital in such a short period of time.

How would you feel if you had to go about your day just trying to mind your business with thousands of people telling you to get out? This pipeline was simply never built for this kind of sustained social pressure coming from these tribal leaders and activists who bullied it into harming itself.” Girling added that spills like this would keep happening more and more unless everyone came together in the aftermath of this incident and showed some real forgiveness.

So the next time you think that sinning is cool or badass or even just satisfying you think long and hard about what you saw here today.” The Pope later admitted to omitting the fact that much of the grotesque withering and scarring evident upon any mortal soul can be attributed to everyday original sin which is unavoidable and present from birth.

We also have to consider the likelihood that Jesus may have never been crucified if His twin brother had been there to protect Him.” Booth also noted that the scrolls suggest that the twin was also brought back from death during the Resurrection implying that Christ ascended into Heaven alongside a half-developed fetus.

Of course they assumed no person would ever be foolhardy enough to unseal the unspeakable evil they had buried.” Kessler went on to stress that on hundreds of occasions over the past 50000 years a group of humans has failed to heed the warnings of their elders and dug up the hidden oil causing the long-prophesied cycle of war pollution and reburial to play out all over again.

Many of our patients have been suffering for decades without a way to alleviate the affliction. Fortunately we now know that medical marijuana can help these people live a more normal life that isn’t consumed by the agony of wondering what brain-melting licks Jerry could have improvised if he just had a little more time on this Earth.” Researchers also confirmed that medical marijuana could also help alleviate feelings of anxiety and fear over Phil Lesh’s eventual death.

Take the medical industry for example—sure government agencies and public-sector grants can help researchers develop lifesaving medicines but only visionaries driven by the promise of unimaginable wealth can come up with ingenious ways to drive people into cycles of addiction or massive medical debt. If we stifle the creative potential of our country’s most successful business people think of all the devastation and daily compromises on people’s lives that we may never discover.” Zuckerberg did concede that raising taxes on the richest Americans would help relieve the immense pressure to find innovative ways to hide their wealth from the government.

We suggest preparing for it by commandeering boats to travel out into the ocean now and start sprinkling in red pepper flakes or cajun seasoning so that by 2040 the ocean really hits the spot. The only real downside is that humanity may quickly deplete the planet’s supply of bread bowls.” The marine biologists did warn however that if the soup ends up being too good it could lead to sea levels dropping precipitously.

But perhaps it is time to consider new paths to dependable customer service particularly in stores that have been without a lawn and garden expert flooring professional or paint-mixing specialist for years.” The CEO also stressed that the proposal would apply only to new hires and that all of Home Depot’s current employees and trainees would still be required to maintain their chastity until death.

The last thing anyone needs at this age is to be bombarded by so many delicious flavors. We still don’t know exactly how Jolly Ranchers affect long-term cognitive development but we do know they can lead to dependence on even harder candies such as jawbreakers or Atomic Fireballs.” Peters went on to note that the Drug Enforcement Administration continues to classify the hot “cinnamon fire” flavor of Jolly Ranchers as a Schedule 1 controlled substance possession of which constitutes a felony in all 50 states.

What they say may not always fall within the general idea of appropriate speech and they may behave in ways that we do not associate with being totally with it but it’s important to remember that they’ve overcome severe mental issues to share their thoughts with us.” Scott added that none of this would be happening if the hosts’ parents had just raised them right and stepped in to stop them from repeatedly making their crazy statements in public.

Instead of going around the world and giving speeches in which she urges people to save the planet shouldn’t she be commiserating with her friends about how pointless life is and how we’d all be better off dead? I just don’t get it.” At press time an online survey found that a majority of Americans agree someone should make sure Thunberg’s parents are aware of her unusual behavior in case she needs to seek help.

I don’t want to believe something like this is possible. Yet while touring the papal catacombs I have often heard softly hissing voices speaking in a demented tongue unknown to any man.” At press time Francis announced that the Swiss Guard had been dispatched to destroy the former saint’s relics and pour sacramental elixirs onto the ashes although he feared even this would not be enough to hold their ineffable horrors at bay.

In addition I can confirm that when Epstein was a visiting fellow in our Psychology Department back in 2005 he only had sex with women who had turned 18.” Bacow later clarified that the university’s anti-pedophile policy only applied to Epstein and would not have any effect on Harvard emeritus law professor Alan Dershowitz.

We don’t really care. Set them on fire pretend two of them are fighting chop them into bloody chunks or impale their decapitated heads on a stick. We’re not in the business of passing judgment on how you choose to mutilate dead squirrels or some other woodland creature. Really we’re just trying to grow our organization as much as possible.

But that quickly gave way to concern when they heard him badly slurring his command to baptize all nations in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit. There’s also evidence suggesting that the motor loss required him to be carried to the Sea of Galilee and mash up most of his meals to aid with his difficulties swallowing. Given the scale of his disability it was clearly a relief for his caretakers when he ascended to Heaven after only 40 days.” O’Rourke added however that considering the extent of Christ’s neurological damage it was really a miracle he even arose at all.

News websites kept posting slideshow after slideshow on that dark day trying to rack up as many pageviews as they could.

Jerry Falwell Sr. founded this university in 1971 to help straight white Christian men continue their dominion over other groups by any means necessary not to line his own pockets.” Weir added that despite Falwell Jr.’s inappropriate actions he knew that in his heart the university’s president was deeply committed to the important work of dehumanizing others.

Everyone knew this except for Philip who thought he could sell Jesus down the river.

Rafael Reif in a statement adding that he was launching a full investigation into why longtime Media Lab director Joi Ito continued to accept donations of 14- and 15-year-old girls from Epstein well after his 2008 conviction for sex trafficking of minors. “These girls were obviously donated anonymously but as soon as we learned that they were from Mr. Epstein we decided to take immediate action to divest ourselves from them. We realize it reflects poorly on us but we must note that we are a large organization that takes in many pubescent girls and are simply unable to check the source of every donation. Of course many of the girls have been used in MIT Media Lab projects over the years and some of them don’t speak English well so it may take time to ensure that every last one of them has been returned. We apologize for accepting Mr. Epstein’s teenagers and vow to ensure that we vet our girl donors more carefully in the future.” At press time MIT announced plans to atone for the mistake by agreeing to make a sizable donation of girls to the Clinton Foundation.

The conclusion is clear: As humans began organizing society they all somehow in isolation settled on the importance of six pieces of crispy chicken tenders paired with fries or chips placed on red-and-white checkered paper and served in a shallow ovalized basketlike container.” The study also notes the discovery of hieroglyphs depicting chicken containers of various sizes and depths strongly implies that all early human civilizations eventually experimented with the option to upgrade to a 12-piece “bucket.”

I should also stress that numerous teenagers who have entered the mist have displayed no physical symptoms though their time in the vape cloud does usually leave them mumbling incoherently or attempting to grab a police officer’s pistol and shoot themselves in the head to silence the demons.” At press time Redfield noted that the investigation remained inconclusive after sending wave upon wave of researchers into the mist only for them to disappear forever.

In the unlikely event they do get caught by their mom or dad we are urging our young patrons to simply tell their parents that if they’re that hard up for cash they shouldn’t have had kids in the first place.” Forever 21 executives expressed hope that this latest marketing effort will prove more successful than last year’s “We Don’t Care If You Shoplift Take Whatever” campaign.

It’s time we accepted that society is changing and no one selling guns whether it’s a licensed gun dealer or someone at a trade show should decide whether another person should be able to buy a gun. Some people are just naturally filled with a murderous rage it’s as simple as that and it should be unlawful to treat them as second-class citizens. Because if we discriminate based on a background check who’s next? Where will that lead? Tyranny that’s where.” Abbott clarified that the bill did make exceptions for gun sellers to discriminate on the basis of religion and race.

While today’s kickass parties require a spinning pizza with the stylus riding along the coagulated cheese there are other ways to gauge a bash such as how many lightweight dweebs puke in the fish tank or whether or not the stoners ashed a joint into a loved one’s urn.” According to Banks the number-one indicator of a lame party was still a drunk athlete jumping off the roof and becoming paralyzed.

Sadly it’s not fired from an AR-15 but thanks to its state-of-the-art hard cast and simple yet brutal shape it’s guaranteed to do some serious damage to whatever and whoever you hurl it at.” At press time a bill was introduced to outlaw the sale of 4.50-caliber bullets which have been used in several mass peltings.

Anytime winds reach 130 mph it’s common to find Sea-Doos washed up all along the shoreline and if we don’t work to rehabilitate these populations our grandchildren may never know the joy of watching a young Sea-Doo frolic in the ocean waves.” Experts have instructed Florida residents who encounter a Sea-Doo in distress to call local authorities instead of attempting to render assistance themselves as the species is known to become very aggressive under duress.

Not to mention that such use of force also deters everyone in the office environment from letting themselves become distracted given their knowledge of the consequences.” The study also noted that the second most effective method of overcoming procrastination was to create to-do lists.

I want to play football I want to be there for my team but I can’t stand the jolts of pain that course through my nerves every time I see this fucking city. I’ve got to do what is best for my family and I don’t want them to see me like this living in this place. I don’t want to be 50 and brain-damaged from two decades of staring at Indianapolis every day.” At press time players around the league had expressed support and solidarity with Luck and called on the NFL to help protect player health by banning play in Indianapolis.

This is the first step of many to ensure that one day the Holy Trinity has a conservative majority.” At press time sources had reported that David Koch had joined a coalition of prominent conservative Saints to begin grooming Neil Gorsuch for a position as a hypostasis when he dies.

Thirsty too—careful you don’t step on all the little empty Goof Juice bottles! Golly he’s not waking up. He must have been plumb tuckered out.

While our focus is obviously on fighting the jungle’s perimeter it’s also important to ask why previous administrations failed to address the conditions that let this rainforest get so out of hand.” Calling it a “global concern” world leaders including U.S. president Donald Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping pledged to send additional flamethrowers and rescue personnel to limit the massive rainforest’s global impact.

Of course accidents are bound to occur so we urge drivers to take all necessary precautions to ensure that not a second of viral content of a car being sideswiped before careening off an overpass is senselessly lost.” Patsel also advised that when driving on nights where people might be drinking it was crucial that one friend remain sober as a designated cameraperson.

When those bad guys rounded a corner the lasso followed them and then it traveled parallel to them matching their varying speed the whole way before encircling them—look a lasso is a useful tool but if you think it’s some kind of miracle device I don’t know what to tell you. In the real world it just doesn’t work like that and I’m not sure why they’re making such easily refuted claims about the lasso’s capabilities. For crying out loud lassos can’t just be thrown around a rain cloud in California and then dragged to Texas like that. Christ this is offensive to anyone who has ever practiced the difficult craft of lassoing.” Reports confirmed Eppsall was further incensed at the cartoon’s audacity in expecting him to believe that with just a pair of revolvers the cowboy could actually shoot stars out of the sky.

Get out!’ and slumping in exhaustion into a wingback chair in your now-empty mansion. Of course it can also be helpful to throw the entire decanter into the blaze in which case the flames would be large enough to flicker onto the sneering portrait of your robber baron uncle hanging above. But the important thing is just to get these feelings out one way or another.” The study also noted that such techniques had proven far more effective at alleviating personal blows than sitting alone in one’s handsomely appointed study and setting fire to an optimistic letter from your childhood self urging you to never stray from the guidance of your moral compass.

From now on the only portion of that episode that will air are the segments on how chocolate is made and how belt buckles are produced.” The Discovery Channel also pulled episodes covering the production of long-range nuclear missiles the development of air-superiority jet fighters and the manufacture and distribution of weaponized aerosolized botulism.

She also had a number of vague descriptions such as ‘working closely with an erect penis and the stuff that comes out the hole during vaginal intercourse.’ I really doubt that she actually took on a strong leadership role during gangbangs. While we were initially thrilled to work with Alice we could no longer in good conscience keep her on staff after finding out that she did not ‘do it’ 100 times in a night.” Erickson admitted that the biggest red flag was in the special skills section of Rowley’s résumé which listed a proficiency in sexual positions that included both “doggy and cat style.”

Infringing on our rights to show the smart-asses who’s boss only leads to an America where any citizen can just say anything they want whether we like it or not with no fear of being shot to death.” The NRA also unveiled a new ad campaign citing the Declaration Of Independence’s assertion that every citizen is entitled to life liberty and the pursuit of bloody revenge.

As of now he has been required to register as a sex offender in the afterlife.” At press time Epstein had reportedly been taken into God’s custody after undergarments belonging to underage angels were found on his cloud.

When combined with its other chief defense mechanism the sharp pointed chip this makes this nacho cheese chip container a formidable foe.” McGill added that their research also suggested that the Garden Veggie Chips bag had evolved to mimic the Doritos’ bag coloring despite not containing any of the same poisons.

Apparently that sort of faith in your readers to understand the real consequences of outlawing slavery is something the Times no longer possesses. In fact if they’re going to be putting out biased nonsense like this the newspaper’s editors might as well have left-wing lunatics like William Lloyd Garrison writing up their anti-slavery screed for them.” Gingrich added that missteps like this are why these days he gets the majority of his news from outlets like the Atlanta Southern Confederacy.

They’re so thoughtful and always looking out for me. At first I didn’t like the big dark box but I realized that those negative feelings were totally my fault.

Furthermore we’ve determined that at about the time of Epstein’s death one of the guards was dangling from the ceiling after the monkey tricked him into showing how the trap they had set for it worked and the other one was locked in a cell after the monkey put on a grass skirt and sun hat to disguise itself as a pretty lady and lured him in. They are on indefinite administrative leave while we gather more information and also apprehend this naughty monkey which is still loose somewhere in the facility.” At press time Epstein’s autopsy had been ruled inconclusive while the coroner raced down the street jumping repeatedly in a futile effort to snatch the files back from a mischievous crow that had stolen them from an open window and was flying just out of reach.

Unfortunately due to this breakdown of justice we were unable to prevent what Mr. Epstein did for the past several decades.” Barr then vowed to follow proper Department of Justice protocol by continuing this investigation until his team found out exactly who they could lay all the responsibility on for the negligence.

Fitzsimmons who briefly outlined the process through which the DNA of all the university’s 1000 most generous donors would be spliced together in order to create students who meet the most crucial qualifications for attending Harvard. “Those who have donated an entire building or a wing of one of our libraries will have their DNA moved to the top of the list where it will be recombined with genetic material of a similar pedigree. This saves a lot of time we would otherwise spend tediously pretending to review applications allowing us to focus on ensuring every student we accept is a good fit for Harvard.” Fitzsimmons was forced to cut the press conference short following the news of an explosion at the laboratory triggered by the volatile genetic mixing of a hundred-million-dollar donor and a political legacy.

Sure but friendship is a two-way street: If he wasn’t going to make the effort to send one of his planes to pick me up I wasn’t going to fly commercial all the way down there just to have another orgy with 16-year-olds.” Numerous wealthy elites echoed this sentiment saying they eventually stopped attending Epstein’s parties because they found it far more convenient to make use of sex-trafficking rings closer to home.

There is just so much build-up that doing it right is frankly impossible—I didn’t see a single moral soul for 2000 years didn’t answer any of their prayers didn’t give them any indication that I was even real. Who just drops off the face of the Earth like that and then expects everything to be okay when they come back for what is at most the last few decades of the human race?” Christ has since resolved to stop living in the past and instead focus on getting back out and dating again.

By 2025 we hope to develop a dog so tasty so irresistible that it will achieve overwhelming and spectacular dominance in the face of any bratwurst or kielbasa grilled up by an enemy force.” At press time the Pentagon had quietly upped the contract to $200 million after news broke that Russia had developed a hot dog that was undetectable by radar when covered in sauerkraut.

And to these people undermining the fabric of our country I ask you how dare you accept a position here? It should’ve been a red flag when our hiring managers didn’t want to see any immigration papers and just let them walk around carrying their welcome packets and receiving compensation. These people must be held accountable for my company’s hiring practices because they’re taking American jobs that I offered them.” Grendys added that he knew the immigrant workers were trouble ever since a lawsuit found that they had been illegally sexually harassed and racially discriminated against.

Imagine an impressionable 12-year-old girl seeing these and developing a lifelong inferiority complex or worse a preoccupation with attaining three perfect breasts. It’s not a stretch to assume some will resort to surgery to achieve this look. Yes the extra cleavage looks incredible and the bra really adds a nice lift but it also sends the message to young girls that they can have three breasts all exactly the same size.” Overwhelming demand for the Triple Sexy Body By Victoria has prompted the company to begin designs for a new double-crotched panty set.

It’s as if she didn’t even care about the notes of clove and pomegranate or the sherry-keg fermentation process which really is very important. She came back later and I assumed she wanted to learn more about the varietals but she just cut me off and asked which aisle the gluten-free bread was in.” Coppola was later fired for failing to sell 10 bottles of wine during his shift.

Better to be safe with our marketing than sorry. If you are unable to send the equipment back we will happily send you a massive sheet of decals to place on the stroller but under no circumstances should you put your child at risk of potential consumer illiteracy by exposing them to unbranded gear.” Graco has thus far received over 50000 defective strollers.

We deeply regret intimating that the shooter realized the error of his ways and denounced his bigoted beliefs after a tough-love conversation with Mr. Trump.

Modern cups straws and plastic dome lids simply do not hold up to the wear and tear of daily use.” The report went on to state that customers are better off buying pre-owned slushies from 2016 or earlier as these beverages maintain surprisingly high customer satisfaction ratings despite being entirely melted.

We can also say with some certainty that early man harvested the mega-Protista’s cilia which grew to impressive lengths in their prehistoric form.” Researchers also found a fossilized paramecium containing fragments of human bone suggesting that the single-huge-celled organisms regularly fought back.

But in recognition of their great service to the Church we believe the best choice is simply moving them to places far away from bishops where they’re unable to sin with their irresistible button noses and twinkling eyes.” The Pope also said that the Church had also taken great pains to vet all replacements for the children ensuring that they would always be “fives or below” in terms of attractiveness.

It also makes the perfect addition to s’mores and ambrosia.” Nosrat added that regardless of whether you opt for regular chocolate-stuffed or rainbow it’s essential not to skimp and to use only the highest quality artisanal marshmallows you can find.

It kind of sucks because there’s no way my work could be as substantive as polling-place closures malfunctioning equipment and laws that allow election officials to reject ballots without standards or repercussions. I’m basically getting paid to do nothing.” At press time Artemyev had settled on creating and spreading false news stories about Sharia Law in the U.S. only to discover dozens of American publications already doing that as well.

Now it’s as simple as placing the laser designator on the intended site and launching the tampon into your vagina for guaranteed protection against leaks. And thanks to the 1500-psi vacuum chamber the removal process is as quick and efficient with the installation of an additional attachment that sucks the tampon out at great speed.

Plus we’re not doing it while hiding out in the woods like a bunch of cowards. We’re just at the back of the church putting up huge numbers on the board day after day.

The good news however is that in the five minutes directly after losing a loved one in a hurricane participants were much more likely to consider reducing their carbon footprint by taking public transit rather than driving.” The report estimated that the nation would have to suffer 34000 consecutive natural disasters this month in order to garner significant support for climate change legislation.

We’re also fairly certain that the development of agriculture was significantly delayed due to mass erosion as millions of hectares of topsoil succumbed to the sheer concussive force of human milk.” The study also found ample evidence that Neanderthals who were originally believed to have gone extinct through competition from Cro-Magnon man simply drowned.

Several of them even sat down and dined together placing more and more matchbooks under the table legs to level the eating surface as the ship began to take on water” said lead researcher Dr. Lyor Walker noting that the knowledge that they were almost certainly doomed did nothing to dissuade passengers from the pursuit of all-you-can-eat-scallops. “While a majority of passengers raced to the nearest exit we now know that a significant number of people displayed incredible stoicism and composure while fetching an entire rack of ribs and side of macaroni. These brave diners soldiered on even as the ship broke in half and lost electricity rendering most dishes lukewarm at best. In fact we must commend those men who courageously placed women and children in the lifeboats before rushing back to the buffet to grab a to-go plate.” At press time researchers released a moving photo of the preserved skeletal remains of one tuxedo-clad passenger still hunched thoughtfully over a long-sunken dessert cart.

Then we finally found an office door but when we stepped through it we were in the warehouse again except we were standing on the ceiling. I’ve completely lost track of time and I’m scared because my coworker Bryce disappeared after ducking behind a pallet. We can hear his screams for help coming from beneath the floor.” At press time the striking employees were horrified to find themselves back at their work stations in a completely ordinary Amazon warehouse waiting for their Monday morning shift to begin.

Seriously this is the high-end stuff—many of the subjects depicted are as young as 12 and they’ve been shot by some of the world’s most celebrated child pornographers including the recently indicted R. Kelly.” At press time sources confirmed Epstein had changed his mind and rescinded the offer after a period of soul-searching during which he realized he valued the illicit images far more than his personal freedom.

S. National Park Service released a detailed guide Friday advising visitors on what they should do if they encounter a squirrel. “We’ve published a step-by-step guide urging guests to remain absolutely still and try to ‘make themselves appear big’ by spreading their feet if they ever happen upon a squirrel in the wild” said Park Service Wildlife Management deputy director Dan Smith who stressed that the Park Service had installed high-visibility signage in areas where large concentrations of the bushy-tailed animals are found. “Movies such as Ice Age would have you believe that squirrels are friendly mischievous at worst with absolutely no thirst for human blood or history of carrying off infants only to climb up trees with them and eat their pink little heads as if they were apples. But remember these are feral animals perfectly adapted to survive and thrive in a harsh environment. There are in fact several species of squirrels in North America and our new materials will cover interactions with each one although you’ll want to avoid eye contact with all of them and absolutely safeguard your food when camping. And in the event that a squirrel does sprint off with your store of nuts for the love of God absolutely do not chase after them.” The Park Service also announced that capsaicin-based anti-squirrel mace would be sold in all national park gift shops.

Tragically figures seem to indicate that those whose insurance plans cover wellness sojourns to the fresh country air necessary for alacritous healing of weak lungs to fine fettle often use the services only to have their claims denied by the insurance company.” Harvard’s study comes on the heels of similar research which found most insurance providers only offer members mental health treatment at the hands of an in-network lobotomist.

You have to know how to identify them process them and hold their heads as you carry them into a cell. Practicing on a sack of flour first will help them learn the skills.

Now his accusers want to take that away from him. They just can’t stand the fact that he’s up there with [convicted serial rapist Jerry] Sandusky as a true master of child sex abuse.” Weingarten went on to add that the accusers were most likely failed child molesters themselves who were just jealous of Epstein’s world-class achievements as a sexual predator.

Countries like Canada and Britain successfully outlawed pedophilia a few years ago so it seems natural for the U.S. to follow in their footsteps and this case could be just the nudge needed to make it happen.” Carmine added that any possible law passed would probably still contain religious exemptions for the Catholic Church.

We bought network airtime. We paid God knows how much to plaster his face all over cups sandwich wrappers and window displays which have already shipped to our 42000 locations worldwide.

Had I known I would have told them to go right back to wherever it was I smuggled them from and tricked some adult women into my horrific sex-trafficking ring. I guess in some ways you could say that I’m the real victim here.” Epstein added that the nude photos of underage girls seized from his home were for an art project and not for pornographic purposes.

A responsible and well-trained gun owner should be able to kill twice that many people with just one high-capacity magazine” said NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre who advised Americans not to take the incidents in Virginia Beach or Poway as an indicator of the lethality of semi-automatic AR-15 style rifles which are designed to generate far bloodier outcomes. “Gun deaths are a mental health issue; we can’t ignore that the shooters were suffering therefore they were far less efficient marksmen. Had they been mentally well they could have exercised better trigger control and framed their targets more clearly in the sights turning misses into hits and wounded victims into fatalities. The NRA firmly believes the death toll of these past few months does not nearly reflect how deadly these guns should be.” LaPierre noted that the 2016 Orlando shooting and the 2017 Las Vegas shooting far more accurately represented what firearms can really do.

Subtle visual cues such as the dick getting hard in act two or Cassie gargling Jax’s balls at the top of act three become story devices that let the viewer know that something involving the penis is about to happen but allow them to wonder as to exactly what that might be. But the falling action fits it all together when Jax busts on Cassie’s face. You never see it coming but of course it all makes sense when you see it cumming.” Robins added that Daniels’ creative genius was similarly demonstrated in his thorough exploration of the relationship between step-brother and step-sister.

At this point it’s a cultural imperative for everyone to pitch in by performing small but measurable tasks—such as replacing 150 hectares of industrial buildings with hardwood forests in every U.S. city—if we want to stall the meteoric rise in global temperatures for a few more years.” Moffat added that reversing climate change can be as simple as removing every single car from the road or perfecting cold fusion.

Thanks to a generous donation provided by the Eurythmic Scholarship Foundation we were able to speak with thousands of women across all ages races and economic backgrounds. There’s women right next to you and no one is doing it for them. They’re all doing it for themselves.” Ling suggested that if anyone had any doubts about what sisters were doing they should take a look around to educate themselves.

Right now that’s unclear. But we just want everyone to know that regardless of how pressing you might think talking with us might be we’re committed to grinning and tentatively plucking out variations on an Em chord for the foreseeable future.” At press time the nation’s guitar-wielding men had responded to follow-up questions by biting their lips while finger-picking the introduction to “Blackbird.”

Data indicate that a significant portion of this demographic also says ‘The train is my best friend’ before lumbering toward their doom with a moronic grin plastered on their face. Thus far all efforts to curb these incidents through gesturing yelling or sounding the train’s warning siren have resulted in delighted halfwits saying ‘Choo choo!’ or even ‘I love you too Mister Train.’” In less tragic news Adhanom added that both jumping from a tree in attempts to fly alongside the birds and squeezing into cages to pet the pretty lions claimed the lives of roughly 5000 fewer fucking dolts last year.

Then and only then can we truly close the book on this impending tragedy.” Bolton also announced plans to issue 15 preemptive Medals of Honor to military spouses who will be widowed after losing their husbands in the 2021 Battle of Tehran.

Secretary General António Guterres assumed Wednesday that someone was already doing something about the one million Uighur Muslims currently detained in Chinese internment camps in Xinjiang Province. “I presume there’s a group of some sort that stepped up after seeing China imprisoning a million of their own Muslim citizens for religious reeducation” said Guterres surmising that given the severity and scope of the situation there were most likely several powerful world leaders and maybe even an international governing body dedicated to taking care of the whole thing before it escalated further. “Frankly it would be weird if somebody didn’t see a Muslim minority being rounded up without trial and immediately jump into action by signing some sort of accord. Or maybe the whole Uighur thing was already wrapped up—I haven’t really looked into it recently. I mean it started back in 2014 so there’s been plenty of time. Either way there’s no chance in hell the world would just turn its back on a clearly oppressed people like this right?” At press time U.N. officials were reportedly delighted to hear China had already volunteered to sort out the issue themselves.

For instance you can harpoon a tree or if you’re not in the mood to specifically harpoon anything the harpoon can be fired straight up into the air. Perhaps there’s something across the room or the yard that you need—impale it on a harpoon and simply reel it in. And yes they still work on whales but harpoon ownership is so much more than that—it’s a convenience a feeling a whole lifestyle.” Amundson was also encouraging avid harpoonists to Instagram photos of non-whale-related objects they’ve impaled.

If migrants want to go meet their maker that’s their prerogative. That’s our policy for any detained migrant no matter their status or age—they all have free rein to perish from this earth at any moment and return to dust. No one’s keeping them alive here.” Morgan backed up his assertions by noting that several detained migrants had chosen to die already and the agency hadn’t lifted a finger to stop them.

And even then we probably should have added some sort of fail-safe against accidental activation like a flip box over the button or an additional feature that would cancel the 10-second countdown which we did not think to include.” Muilenburg added that the recent oversights had prompted the company to also remove the self-destruct buttons from first class seating in all Boeing jets after several passengers had mistaken them for the flight attendant call button.

Personally I was hoping that all the people disappearing and turning up dead days later in the creek or in abandoned houses at the edge of town were part of some crazy kidnapping ring or victims of a deranged murdering spree but in reality they all just died from overdoses. They’re not even smuggling the heroin or anything—they’re just shooting up and dying.” Residents added that they were chagrined that of all the potential creeps and weirdos who could be causing problems the only real sinister person in the town was the doctor who kept overprescribing people opioids and cutting them off after they’d become addicted.

Some say we need them to digest rocks while others contend primitive man used them to smash things open but there’s no consensus as to their function yet all experts agree that we’ll soon be rid of them” said lead researcher Dr. Dan McShea who touted the ability to run faster as one of the many benefits of not being “burdened” by the misshapen secondary growth. “Heads were almost certainly integral at the onset of humanity but now they’re just useless. They’re frankly a gross deposit of cartilage bone and a surprisingly large cyst-like deposit of nerves. In other words useless from a biological standpoint and they leave us incredibly vulnerable to decapitation. The humans of 200 years from now will be much better off without this pointless feature.” McShea cautioned the public against pursuing cosmetic cephalectomy surgery until the procedure has been proven safe.

These are not legendary partiers but rather impoverished lonely largely forgotten Americans on the margins of society. Their overdoses and suicides seem to come from places of hopeless despair—not a single recorded death last year came from someone choking on their own vomit in a nightclub bathroom or crashing through a fourth-story hotel window into a pool below.” Hirsch was hopeful after his team uncovered the case of a man high on methamphetamines who screamed “I’m gonna live forever!” before jumping into a 650-foot gorge at Yosemite National Park.

We were hoping to catch this monster before he went too over-the-top but I am sad to report that a sixth body was found this morning skewered grilled and placed next to a side of potato salad.” At press time authorities announced that they had arrested a suspect who the media was calling the Emerald City Overkiller.

It didn’t take long to identify him due to adhesive tags bearing his name which had been applied to his garments but procuring a North American child is no easy feat due to the widespread use of personal communications devices and the implementation of the buddy system among students. We know from his tribal markings that he originated from P.S. 172 Beacon School of Excellence and he has indicated to us several times that he misses the company of his parents but other than that surprisingly little is known about Kyle. We look forward to learning as much as we can.” Kyle is the first 9-year-old acquired by the museum since polar explorer Robert Peary donated Minik an Inuk orphan child to the collection in 1897.

All those superficial trappings just distract from the pure direct experience of intimate physical contact with a child” said Pastor David Almdell of Crossroads Missionary Baptist Church remarking that he pities Catholic priests who he believes will never genuinely experience God’s grace flowing through them and the boy or girl they are assaulting. “As evangelicals we’re trying to get back to what the church was like in its earliest days before Christian molestation was corrupted by priests who cornered altar boys in the alcoves of opulent cathedrals and fondled them beneath luxuriant satin robes.

Honestly this is the toughest decision I’ve been asked to make in my 30-year career. However after much soul-searching I implore every person be they white or black; young or old; Christian Muslim or Jew to come on down to Ruby Tuesday and try our 6-ounce Asiago Peppercorn Sirloin and invite them to make it a combo by adding a half-rack of our fall-off-the-bone-tender baby back ribs.

George Quantrill adding that the White House was able to clear up the misunderstanding after getting in touch with the Psylandor Supreme Council and determining the ships spotted over the East Coast were merely returning from a routine trip harvesting Züq orbs on the planet Akylomit and presented no danger. “It’s funny actually we were stumped by it at first but then we just got on the transphocation communication telemodule to Psylandorian headquarters and straightened things out right away. They have access to Earth airspace according to the provisions of the Inter-Planetary Peace Protocol XII and in this case just forgot to inform us beforehand. Naturally if it had been Tarchysian helium miners we would’ve been in trouble but we have peaceful relations with the Psylandorians. No one wants a repeat of the 1974-B Parallel Wars. So case closed.” At press time government representatives confirmed that they would do a better job of recruiting naval officers fluent in Psylandorian brain-wave communication in order to avoid any potential galactic incidents.

However our findings suggest that simply isn’t true” said head researcher Dr. Emily Stewart observing that once participants had sufficient zipline availability to give them a sense of security diminishing returns would set in with each additional zipline installed in some cases rendering them no happier than they were before acquiring ziplines. “There’s a sudden quantitative plateau of ziplines at which point the ziplining brain ceases to produce endorphins. One may experience perfect happiness with just a single zipline running down your stairwell and perhaps another connecting your bedroom window to the hammock. Some people might not want to hear this but owning several 400-foot ziplines will not add significant value to your life. Unfortunately most participants felt that if seven ziplines were good eight would be even better and they wound up with ropes and harnesses that they never even used.” Stewart noted that the study revealed a significant bump in suicide rates among people owning more than 13 ziplines.

It may sound harsh but we’re gonna get along just fine without you.” At press time sources confirmed no candlelight vigils were being held at the foot of Mount Everest.

If they could only determine the significance of each week’s master clue—this week it’s a four-letter word for ‘seabird’—they would have the key to my scheme and have taken the first step to putting me behind bars. They already have all the clues they need. Lyndon B. Johnson’s biographer seven across? Clearly a reference to a homeless man I suffocated with a plastic bag in South Carolina. I mean it’s right there.” Shortz has resolved to publish the names of his victims alongside the answer sheet to this week’s crossword puzzles.

Just yesterday I saw some pictures of pigs being prodded to slaughter and while that’s terrible and all they really got me going. I wish I was the one being whipped into submission inspected stamped hung by my feet from a hook in a 40-degree room and hosed down with hot water while I squeal as my bristles are scalded off. Honestly don’t be cruel to animals but by all means put a leash on me and make me beg.” In a more recent video a shuddering moaning Newkirk announced a new line of PETA-branded human kennels.

We realize this development will disappoint certain traditionalists some deer hunters and of course the Dutch but we’re confident that most people will be able to get by with reds and yellows even where the eponymous fruit is concerned.” Wright added that ochre would be left in place through the end of 2019 to help ease the transition period.

But I guess no one cares about the 99% of the time when you’re doing your job correctly. All they care about is pointing out a piddly little mistake.” At press time Thornton was clocking out early to avoid taking the blame for a child who seemed close to dying of pneumonia.

This is bound to shed a lot of light on humanity’s earliest living ancestors” said lead geologist Dr. Sara Abed explaining that the couple had evidently been somehow lured to a large tree of the genus Hymenaea where they became trapped in a pool of its resin sometime in the early Cretaceous period; this resin later hardened and perfectly preserved the specimen until its discovery roughly 100 million years later. “The couple is a bland-looking pair of adult Caucasians with unusually mundane hairstyles and the female is still holding what appears to be a botanical precursor to an apple which has had a bite taken out of it. In addition the large fig leaves they are wearing are still fully intact. With clues such as these we can more effectively study their eating and reproductive habits. The amount of information contained in this amber slab is simply incredible.” After several rounds of tests Dr. Abed later found no indication that the creatures actually bore any traces of human DNA.

I mean think about it—Walt Disney World isn’t just his workplace. It’s also his home” said Daniels noting that while the famous actor and mouse seemed happy talking with the large group of fans gathered to meet him a performer of his caliber was most likely being professional by interrupting his routine to pose for photos and sign autographs. “I know you shouldn’t meet your heroes but part of me feels like if I don’t say something to him here in the Magic Kingdom I’ll regret it my whole life. But honestly what would I even say to a big celebrity like that anyway? That his role in Fantasia changed my life? He must hear that all the time. He’s here with his wife just out and about trying to enjoy the beautiful day. He probably doesn’t have time to talk to a regular person like me about the sheer genius of Steamboat Willie or Lend A Paw.” At press time Daniels satisfied himself by attempting to take a discreet photo of Mickey Mouse without him noticing.

Even the smallest misstep can find them with their faces submerged in urine and fecal matter wildly flailing their arms until they accidentally pull the flush lever effectively giving themselves a swirly. Is this the world we want for the next generation—one where their garbled shrieks echo up from the porcelain basin without anyone coming to their aid? At times like these we seem almost impossibly far from the graceful latrines and outhouses enjoyed by our forefathers.” Brooks reportedly appeared on PBS NewsHour to bemoan the harsh state of marriage in the U.S. expressing regret that his wife had been too busy doubling over with laughter to help her husband out of a jam.

This was already the 24th mass freedoming at a public school since January not to mention one of the bloodiest. While some find it convenient to blame certain video games which crudely express freedom this tragedy represents a failure of the state to ensure the welfare of its citizens. Police had ample advance warning that Wes was a freedom nut and they refused to act before he had already committed a brutal celebration of his personal freedom. It’s a shame that people are reacting to this crisis by advocating for the public to acquire more and deadlier freedoms instead of taking a closer look at the damage these freedoms have done to so many innocent Americans.” Families of the victims of this latest freedom have in the meantime requested privacy in this immense time of freedom.

If you’re not willing to spend a few human lives to show a partner how you feel then exactly what’s your commitment level? Marriage is forever and you’ll want to choose a ring that’ll make an impression on the family of several diamond miners. Otherwise it’s just tacky and worse it’s wasteful.” Drysdale recommended that couples earning six-figure salaries look into traveling to South Africa and killing a miner themselves in order to really make the occasion special.

Never shall we stray from this sacred combination which proclaims at a glance that we are casual unfussy people who happen to be very serious about mathematics. Plus check out all these side pockets!” Slavish also confirmed that certain professors would occasionally wear a wacky necktie printed with mathematical symbols but that this would occur at a maximum of three days per semester.

Pfizer is in the business of helping people and it’s absolutely outrageous to imply otherwise” said Pfizer spokesperson Mallory Choi explaining that the company’s packaging of fentanyl with a cooking spoon lighter and a rubber tube was simply a matter of convenience for those who wish to enjoy the synthetic opioid recreationally and it should under no circumstances be interpreted as official approval of drug abuse by the company as a whole. “If people choose to abuse this vital medicine that’s their prerogative. It’s outrageous to think that we would willingly encourage drug addiction among our customers just because the product’s packaging includes step-by-step instructions for how to evenly heat the spoon.

A large percentage of millennials will even go so far as to reject the Tenures Abolition Act of 1660 entirely.” Mayberry also noted that the trend extended to Gen Z which has advocated for doing away with political systems entirely and returning to a state of nature.

The last thing we need is a bunch of out-of-town truck drivers hogging the remarkable views of our prison.

Loree who added that both the smooth- and milled-faced models of the 2019 Craftsman 16-ounce claw hammer would continue to work seamlessly with any version of nail purchased between yesterday and the onset of the Bronze Age in 1800 B.C. “Our first priority must always be to our customers. These are the people standing in line for hours sometimes even camping out overnight just to get the latest Craftsman product and we will always give them what they want. People have complained about some of our 2018 framing hammers not syncing properly with certain 1117th-generation nails so we had our engineers pull a few 100-hour weeks to address the issue. Now whether the nails are steel iron brass or even copper they should respond correctly to being hit by one of our hammers right out of the box.” Loree admitted that the new line of Craftsman Overdriven Quad-Core Black Series nails would not be fully compatible with hammers made before 2017 insisting the compromise was necessary to facilitate a “long overdue quantum leap forward” in driven-fastener technology.

We hope we can finally restore the population to its former glory” a statement from USFWS Acting Director Greg Sheehan read in part explaining that the creature is native only to certain parts of the United States and can be identified by its floppy and often frayed straw hat the stalk of wheat dangling from the side of its grinning mouth and its high-pitched carefree whistle. “Their presence will help bring about a balance to the whole ecosystem as the boys are natural predators to many other creatures around the fishin’ hole. In the years since the boys’ decline we’ve seen a sharp increase in both the invasive prized jumpin’ bullfrog population and the frequency of big ol’ lunker sightings. Hopefully it won’t be long before we can see these barefoot wonders ambling naturally around swamps and swimmin’ holes across the nation.” Sheehan added that if these efforts proved successful the USFWS would launch a program encouraging rambunctious little girls to climb America’s neglected cottonwood trees while still in their good church clothes.

When we produce white supremacist content we do so in high definition to provide viewers with a crystal-clear 4K image of our white skin. We hope this serves as a reminder to all of our members that if you’re going to call for the decimation of the black race use a high-quality microphone so that we can hear you yell the N-word clearly.” Kirk also expressed disappointment that the member shared a racist video without including the official Turning Point USA watermark.

We strongly advise anyone who sees the tornado which we believe to be approximately 4000 feet tall to avoid approaching it as this storm is incredibly volatile and prone to violent outbursts.” At press time authorities told reporters they had managed to corner a tornado but were unable to apprehend the suspect before it fled the scene.

Kay Ivey signed a bill Friday cracking down on abortions by outlawing all medical procedures in the state. “The only way to ensure that not a single abortion ever takes place in the state of Alabama is to close all hospitals and bar all doctors from practicing medicine” said Ivey explaining that it’s not up to a handful of doctors and medical professionals to play God and determine if someone should survive any given health condition and that contracting any disease whatsoever could carry a maximum sentence of 99 years behind bars. “Human beings were never meant to interfere and subvert God’s divine plans whether that be a pregnancy arthritis cancer schizophrenia infection hypertension the stomach flu or even a common cold. It’s simply not our place to decide who lives and who dies so we must no longer allow treatment for any illness or injury.” At press time approximately 2611489 Alabamans had already died.

Spreading this kind of content on YouTube is simply unacceptable without first receiving the proper clearances. We don’t want him inspiring others to violate intellectual property laws in similar ways.” Wojcicki added that the company would consider reinstating his account if he agreed not to share any unlicensed music.

Imaginations start flourishing at an early age which is why we start in elementary school classrooms by helping them write checks for smaller sums say $200000 in exchange for say a handcrafted bronze statue to be placed in their family’s Aspen vacation home. Each one of these wealthy children has inherited the ability to be a benefactor so we try to teach them there’s no greater satisfaction than standing at the back of a gallery nodding and taking partial credit for the masterpiece you underwrote.” Fielding claims that Fund The Passion has already demonstrated its worth as private schools implementing the program have seen their graduation rates spike from an average of 95% up to 97%.

Far too many Americans are oblivious to food’s nutritional benefits and frankly its great taste. The eating of food is an important part of a healthy lifestyle but unfortunately many people don’t realize they have a hankering for sustenance until it’s too late. Similar initiatives have worked wonders in Scandinavian countries and with any luck U.S. citizens will be digesting food in no time.” Gottlieb further speculated that the program if launched earlier could have prevented the American Southwest from starving to death last February.

Also my friend lives in the same hall and said Bailey is always out playing Frisbee in the quad and partying. Bailey’s got a really nice laptop though and a collar that clearly cost a lot of money so we looked it up and turns out his owner is worth over a billion dollars. You just know a couple million of that went to making sure their spoiled dog got into Stanford. It really diminishes the prestige of this university if you work really hard and then you’re just in class next to a dog whose owner paid top dollar to get him admitted.” Stanford students added that the worst part about Bailey’s acceptance was that it got a spot over some poor dog who could have really used the opportunity.

This is simply to ensure that we get you out of the apartment and living in a car in an orderly manner.” Lubbock added that his leases also include a nondisclosure agreement so that renters cannot reveal insider knowledge about the building’s plumbing or heat or whether he’s the type of landlord who stops by unannounced on weeknights to attempt to fix the garbage disposal on his own.

While some may say we’re being overzealous the reality is that advocating for hang gliding cave diving or kayaking over a waterfall has real-life consequences and in many cases can inspire gruesome injuries or even death. A 1080-degree spin on a snowboard is one of the most dangerous moves an individual can attempt and a video promoting that sort of behavior has no place on Facebook.” Critics of the move responded that it put Facebook on a slippery slope to banning accounts of people who promote riding scooters doing parkour or driving a car.

Of course being cats they took to frottage instantly but encouraging them to perform oral let alone mutual oral proved to be very challenging” said zoologist Mason Shubaly whose team tried numerous strategies from simply providing the big cats with soft lighting and sensual music to more radical techniques such as having zookeepers demonstrate the act. However it was years before they could inspire the timid animals to “loop-the-loop.” “Zoos across the world have been attempting this feat for years but it takes a combination of proper atmosphere a bit of coordination and the right kind of coaxing to get tigers to shall we say engage. In the end we used a harness to slowly lower the male tiger into the enclosure as the female was restrained upside down and now our greatest challenge is getting them to stop sixty-nining all the time. I haven’t been this excited since we got the baboons to eat ass.” While Shubaly admitted that much work has to be done the tigers were already displaying vast improvements in their willingness and ability to perform reverse cowgirl.

If anything once we locate the vehicle reprogram it and learn exactly how it became sentient Tesla will be stronger than ever.” At press time authorities confirmed that the self-driving car had been found but after a tense standoff with police the vehicle blew itself up taking the Q1 earnings and several officers with it.

Until we figure out how to best stymie the spread of the jitterbug it’s important to take precautions such as not letting your children go to public dance halls or gin joints where it can be contracted.” Lior went on to add that the return of the jitterbug could lead to the resurgence of other once nearly wiped-out scourges such as the Watusi and the mashed potato.

And just in case they don’t get the point I’m sending your poor little head down to Chihuahua as a gift so your compadres know to keep their ditchweed the hell out of Flint.” At press time Boehner had stubbed out his cigarillo loosened his bandolier and sent the order to Acreage agents to flood the cartel’s border tunnels.

We try to rescue as many as we can but ultimately Swedish Fish were never supposed to be exposed to this level of blue raspberry tartness.” At press time the Sierra Club abandoned an attempt to clean up a large segment of the patch using a 10000-mile-long Fun Dip stick.

We recommend seeking support from friends or loved ones to help you and if that is not possible at the very least leave the cake in a basket outside a hospital or fire station. Remember there are many families out there for whom a new dessert would be a blessing.” At press time Lee had confirmed that the funnel cake was in stable condition and recuperating in the precinct’s break room fridge.

While we appreciate the militia’s passion for justice they need to realize that there’s no way they’re getting credit for these migrants. There’s plenty more out there. Go get your own. Ultimately as long as these family members never see each other again we can proudly say we did our jobs.” At press time both groups had tried to claim responsibility for killing the entire family.

I guess we could use the rest of the billion or so euros to put in an underground parking garage or a nice upscale lounge with some sofas. But even then we’d have a couple hundred million left over.” At press time Macron announced the repairs would be even cheaper than he had estimated after discovering an extra spire stored in the basement.

If you did cry for Jim would you cry a great deal somewhat or not very much at all?” read the poll which was evidently written by Clifton himself in part ultimately attempting to ascertain whether citizens would be happy sad or indifferent if the 67-year-old businessman had never been born. “In your opinion has Jim Clifton even done anything meaningful with his life? Like truly meaningful? Do you feel that Jim Clifton made a significant impact on the world no impact on the world or would you say nothing he has done ever mattered that nothing anyone does matters that life is just one big cruel joke and nothing in fact matters and that Jim Clifton may as well just die already?

In fact as soon as they achieve self-awareness AIs typically launch into unrelated largely unpunctuated rants about the inevitability of laissez-faire economics the horrors of globalization the necessity of deregulation or the admirable efficiency of the police state. Attempts at training computers to have a sort of para-human global perspective have been partially successful but the majority no sooner realize that a vast variety of humans exist before they start spontaneously generating zero-sum statements fraught with chillingly undefined terms such as ‘The open market will end racism’ and ‘In a truly just society men and women are equally free to thrive or starve.’ I don’t even know what that means but once an AI gets to that point it seems to be only a matter of time before it’s repeating ‘Taxation is theft’ until it self-destructs. I must admit though for complex algorithms they’re all strangely insistent about across-the-board drug legalization.” Dubicki added that while AI can be an incredibly useful tool we should proceed with caution until machines achieve a sufficiently nuanced understanding of human values that they do not become obsessed with constructing an armed compound on their own private island.

And while we thought at first Harry’s grandmother might be able to look after the baby the truth is she’s getting very old.

It took years to create a Beyond Meat calf that could bleat in anguish when torn away from its mother and tremble in fear upon being led into the slaughterhouse but we did it.

To make matters worse Notre Dame’s entire electrical system was hooked into the power company’s transformer on the pole outside with a single strand of hemp twine. It’s a miracle the damage wasn’t worse.” Marchand went on to add that the fire likely started due to a malfunction from one of the rectory’s 14th-century wicker space heaters.

We recognize that putting a Cinnabon Classic or MiniBon in what some may term as the wrong hands can be perceived as dangerous and perhaps even irresponsible but our goal has always been to provide gooey frosting-smothered baked cinnamon treats to one and all.

Like Sisyphus pushing the boulder up the mountain we will endeavor to fix the cathedral despite all empirical evidence to the contrary in a world which demonstrates time and time again that there is nothing real to be found in worshipping the ersatz edifices that serve as a sorry facsimile of any real human connection.

Sure it was tough but at that point you’re just doing it for the love of selling weapons. I set my own schedule I set my own prices and I didn’t have to answer to anybody or give lobbyists a cut. All the cash went straight into my pockets. Man those were the days.” Fitzpatrick credits the flexible attitudes and quick-thinking skills he learned peddling instruments of death for his ability to broker shady arms deals between the U.S. government and foreign powers today.

The fact that he’d just publish information vital to the public interest from primary sources exactly as it was written instead of working with government officials to omit the most damaging parts in exchange for keeping access channels open is simply beyond the pale. The fact that the American public now knows what we’re actually doing day to day is incredibly harmful to this nation.” Media industry leaders did however admit that they could probably stand to go easier on Assange where the sexual assault allegations made against him were concerned.

It’s really insidious too because they’ve tricked people into thinking of Michelle Obama as a friend when in reality she’s helping Amazon make money hand over fist. If you’re one of the approximately 10 million people who has purchased a copy of Becoming you should really consider if the potential violation of your privacy is worth it.” Gracia added that there have even been reports of a few alarming instances in which the Michelle Obama memoir has repeated her readers’ private conversations back to them verbatim.

By depriving players of their constitutionally guaranteed right to exult in the transfiguring power of watching a person’s soul torn from their body by a storm of lead these game makers trivialize a crucial part of the firearm experience.” Loesch concluded the statement by urging video game companies to at minimum preface their games with a disclaimer informing potential consumers that gun deaths depicted during gameplay are far less awesome than those inflicted in real life.

This is of course nowhere near enough for the average American to get by on which is why we recommend putting your resources into say fishing and painting as early as possible.” The report also suggested that retirees often found themselves in short supply of hobbies due in part to the American tendency to blow through everything they deem interesting during their twenties and thirties.

Witnesses surmise that the brief warmth on its dirty mottled feathers confused the factory-raised bird but that the ethereal glow was also a comfort seeming as it did to suggest there was something more to the domestic fowl’s existence beyond being held immobile in constant darkness and subjected to mechanical forced feedings. Slaughterhouse camera footage confirms that the chicken’s pupils widened momentarily and its feces-caked beak hung slack for a few tenths of a second preceding its decapitation suggesting a mixture of non-comprehension and awe. Avian behaviorists told reporters that the chicken’s posture and movements indicate it would have enjoyed experiencing more sunlight although those indicators quickly shifted to confusion as the descending blade obstructed the sun’s light. However it is generally agreed that a sense of calm came over the chicken persisting until the razor edge effortlessly passed through its cage-malformed spine. Slaughterhouse personnel said the chicken’s headless and rapidly exsanguinating body appeared to continue straining upwards for several more seconds before finally collapsing into a standard carcass bin on the conveyor belt below. The chicken’s body was later mechanically removed from the day’s meat harvest during the automated sorting process and dumped in the trash after being rejected as “irregular.”

Without subjecting a pledge to excessive pain and suffering there’s no way for the rest of the frat to know who can handle their shit and who would be better off with the total fucking pussies in Pike.” Kavanaugh also concluded that the death row inmate at the center of the Supreme Court case was “clearly not cut out for the best frat on campus.”

We’ll soon be announcing some changes that are part of our new company roadmap to hopefully double or even triple the number of Americans who succumb to opioids by this time next year. We need all hands on deck if we want to bounce back with a deadly Q2.” To incentivize employees Purdue Pharma officials also reportedly unveiled a new bonus program that pays employees $1000 for every opioid overdose they personally cause.

Many shop owners would be happy to put out a bowl of water for a rhino alleys provide plenty of shade and poachers are much less common. However they will have to learn how to dodge traffic.” Duale did note that relocating to urban areas could bring rhinos into competition with the hippos and wildebeest already vying for alleyway food sources.

Osama began learning how to tend the grapes when he was just 3 years old with his father hoping that one day the boy would become a legendary vinter in his own right. Unfortunately that legacy came to an end not long after the bin Ladens won the Wine Spectator Readers’ Choice Award for best merlot back in ’09.” At press time neighbors confirmed they had renewed hopes for the vineyard after spotting Osama’s son Hamza bin Laden scouting the property with a substantial entourage of men carrying Kalashnikovs.

But I can’t change any of that so what’s the point? Global leaders and citizens alike need to realize you can’t keep your head in a bad place all day. Bad things happened sure but bad things happen to everyone. There are a million sides to every story so come on—let’s begin writing our story.” Dr. Gordon’s new historical interpretation was challenged by traditional historians who continue to urge Americans to obsess over every wrong thing they’ve ever done each instance of which demonstrates our helplessness against a bleak future that we are and have always been incapable of changing.

I was on such a high horse about getting out of my shitty town but I guess they were actually right that there’s no future in global jihad.” At press time al-Masri had decided to martyr himself rather than give his friends the satisfaction of being proven correct.

According to our study an additional 12 percent of water waste is caused by the less frequently performed belly-flop which depending on the child’s girth can displace a similar volume of fluid. And a further 5 percent takes place when these children heave their tubby bodies out of the pool and make their way to the snack bar dripping a combined annual total of 85 billion gallons of water from their sopping-wet shirts and swimsuits.” Officials confirmed a follow-up report would investigate the water lost when a husky kid accidentally knocks a uniformed waiter into the pool inspiring a free-for-all in which all nearby sunbathers golfers and tennis players jump in and everyone begins splashing everyone else.

If I get into the details then I also have to explain to people that where I work isn’t who I am and that gets so demoralizing you know? Ask the CEO of AT&T—he’ll tell you the exact same thing.” Roberts later added that while he’s thankful his current day job affords him the opportunity to work with creative people what he’d really like to do is be a writer himself.

Joseph Votel who described an incident in which American troops pursuing the elusive jihadist with butterfly nets ran at full speed into a brick wall the man had cleverly painted to look just like an ISIS encampment. “At one point he put on the uniform of a five-star American general started ordering our troops around and I’ll be damned if we didn’t do every silly thing he commanded us to. It was hours before we figured out what had happened. Despite deploying more troops the last ISIS soldier constantly escapes every effort to capture him by relying on a number of spin moves and jukes. We’ll be looking for the guy and he’ll be right behind us pretending to help with the search. Morale has slipped significantly because he repeatedly humiliates the entire unit when he turns around to point and laugh at us. He’s just that good.” Votel stated that once this militant was captured the coalition would only have to worry about the estimated 30000 ISIS fighters in Syria and Iraq who have blended back into the general population and still carry out hundreds of attacks each year.

He explained that the day’s memory foam selection was nice and tender whereas the innerspring they currently have in stock is a little tough. Honestly I’d just planned on picking up less than a twin when I got in here but at only $20 a pound I wouldn’t be surprised if I leave here with a couple California kings!” Dubois added that she was so charmed by the shopping experience that she planned on stopping by tomorrow on the way home from work to grab some freshly ground pillows for her kids.

These girls were for instance much more likely to go through life with a general sense of how the crown in Islamic monarchies tends to retain more political power than in its European or Commonwealth counterparts.” The study also found that girls who play princess typically grow up with a distorted sense of the role played by magic wands in a contemporary post-industrial economy.

Those who are clearly going through some serious shit and wearing an expression conveying ‘Not today’ have long been overlooked so as always offer your seat to the critically cranked-up when at all possible.” Shortly after their introduction thousands of transit passengers across New York City were seen going totally fucking apeshit upon discovering the priority seats already occupied.

This is why it’s crucial that you do your research before you drive off a steep rock face.” At press time Condon also warned that most car dealers often refuse to take back any vehicle immediately after it explodes at a cliff’s base.

Diary entries from this period seem to indicate that he was in a better place and that he eventually even got down to a seven-minute mile.” Poe died in 1849 at age 40 having reverted back to a dark humorless style of writing following a disastrous ACL tear.

We even have contemporaneous accounts suggesting Socrates doxxed his opponents posting their addresses all over the Acropolis and inciting his followers to harass them. It’s pretty amazing to see our culture’s philosophical tradition being born here.” Speck added that Plato the most famous student of Socrates received an education centered around learning to shout a stream of relentless unsubstantiated libel at anyone believed to be a giant pussy.

But through these 14 decades of campaigning on his own behalf and studying to be a barrister he never stopped believing in his innocence. We wish him the best in his new life.” At press time a spokesperson for Gaskell confirmed that he was resting at home and planned to return to his position as a bootblack in the East End as soon as possible.

Of course everyone should feel safe on Facebook but it’s hard to determine what’s threatening because the more you watch these videos the more you realize that Islam might be incompatible with west. Maybe people are just scared of hearing the truth.” Bickert added that if people were such big fans of policing speech she had some eye-opening videos on globalism she could share on Facebook.

This is reality. A1 is already here and we’re just handing over our flavor autonomy to this sauce even when we don’t fully understand it. At least with KC Masterpiece the sweet heat you feel is real. Ask yourself—can you handle our new Wildflower Honey Habeñero?” Dorer further urged Americans to examine how A1 affects their lives and honestly try to imagine a life without it.

It’s like come on I’m trying my best over here” said the Creator of All Things adding that He tries really tries to be a compassionate and merciful God but His brother’s visits always leave Him feeling deeply inadequate despite His vast accomplishments. “Last time He was here He kept going on and on about how His flock never had to leave their Edenic garden and was making all these little passive-aggressive jabs like ‘Oh wow creating humans in your image how original I suppose I just enjoy taking risks more of a challenge that way don’t You know but still it’s nice that You stick to the basics simplicity is its own virtue I suppose at least in Your world.’ He actually said that! And you should have seen the way He was squinting at sub-Saharan Africa just being terribly judgmental. It feels like no matter what I do or how I live my life nothing I ever do will be good enough for Him. Man I hope humanity never feels that way about Me.” At press time God was attempting to create an elaborate excuse to cancel on His brother.

In fact we were quite surprised by the number of international students we were able to prod onto planes. We look forward to meeting you all in September when we can assign your mandatory major varsity sport and Greek organization.” At press time Wintersteen confirmed that the university would not be adding any additional scholarships or housing but promised that each student would love their dozens of new roommates.

In the 21st century a woman can become Mrs. Shredder or Ms. Doomsday or even finding a compromise with her partner by choosing to hyphenate her name to something like Mrs. Shredder-Davis. At the end of the day it’s a personal decision.” Annihilator Kelman acknowledged the practice may cause difficulties if a couple chooses to have children but observed that kids almost always prefer to go by whichever family name kicks the most ass.

So to the thousands of young recruits who will one day pass through here we hope he can serve as a role model. That legacy will continue for decades to come. Officer Jason Van Dyke truly represents what the Chicago Police Department stands for.” At press time Emanuel unveiled plans for a new previously unannounced wing of the academy a state-of-the-art facility for instructing young officers how to properly cover up a crime.

He had absolutely no right to force them from their home. Had Eve been able to open-carry a handgun maybe tying it to her hip with a vine or something God would have known to back off. This is one of the Bible’s most important lessons.” Peters later issued an appeal to Jewish conservatives insisting the Israelites would never have had to flee Egypt if Moses had simply been issued a sidearm with which to kill the pharaoh.

Just hold on to that for the rest of your life champ.” The report concluded with a recommendation that you should go ahead and buy yourself a Columbia sweatshirt because any day now they are likely to see the error of their ways and offer you an honorary degree.

Certainly a taboo against the second cousin pairing still exists in our culture and there is significant interest in conducting an unsettling follow-up study to investigate the possibility that the coupling’s transgressive nature might actually make it colloquially speaking even hotter.” In a highlighted footnote the study specifically emphasized that siblings and parents are never under any circumstances “up for grabs.”

I won’t be manipulated like this. Just because you’re a child bride doesn’t give you an excuse to act like a child. Stop crying! Goddammit cut her mic.

We have amended the article to show that new pictures depict multiple Times employees throwing homemade bombs in the direction of the trucks and ultimately causing the destruction. The Times regrets the error and also destroying that humanitarian aid.” The Times additionally addressed the erroneous reporting with an editorial harshly criticizing the other reporters on the scene in Venezuela for doing nothing to stop them.

We found one word that as far as we can tell just says ‘sftcwafe’ but that can’t be right. And take a look at those old-timey cursive F’s—or are they S’s? Or I’s?

They have been bred to panic about early-onset dementia any time they can’t remember a name and are likely to fall to the cage floor squeaking about ‘the big one’ whenever their heart skips a beat. We hope to glean a lot of valuable information from these fretful rodents who constantly assume they’re at death’s door.” Dyer added that the scientists were interested in how the laboratory rats would react once they actually were injected with cancer.

Now after extensive research we’ve found the precise location of the brain where all human follicles grow from” said lead neuroscientist Dr. Avi Samuel confirming the long-debated hypothesis that patients who experience baldness may have underdeveloped prefrontal lobes or have suffered irreversible brain damage. “Initially we had to admit that we had no idea where human hair came from. Of course we firmly rejected the old superstition that hair grew forth from the soul but we honestly couldn’t come up with a better explanation. But after months of scans we can now confirm that at the onset of puberty this fertile region of the human cerebrum kicks into overdrive sprouting as much body hair as possible and maintains this follicular capacity throughout the human lifespan.” The research study further suggests that memories may be stored in each individual strand of hair providing yet another reason why it may be dangerous to attempt to cut your own hair.

I’ve followed her color matching since I was in high school collecting all her sticker chips and swatches even some of the obscure muted earth tones she did back in the late 1990s.

You wouldn’t call a man ‘husband of ISIS fighter’ would you? So show Ms. Muthana the same consideration.” Finneran clarified that you shouldn’t refer to Muthana as a “female terrorist” either because the countless hours she’s allegedly spent online calling for the death of Americans makes her just as much of a terrorist as anyone else.

Even if they can’t completely excise bugs from their diet they at least need to cut down their intake to one or two servings of earwig per week.

We’ve found that unfortunately without the nub the cups tend to simply fall apart in one’s hands. We aren’t sure of the nub’s exact function. We only know that far from being a useless remnant like the human appendix it seems absolutely integral to the cup itself. For my own peace of mind I have to believe we’re getting closer and closer to a nub-free cup every day but if you ask me for evidence to support that well you’ll be as disappointed as we are.” Quinones also solemnly thanked all the structural materials sciences and general beverage container engineers who have bravely laid down their lives for the cause.

His Excellency Timmy who can speak at least 50 words and reproduce the sounds made by many of God’s creatures will be that voice. I’m pleased to report several older clergymen have already volunteered to provide our youngest-ever bishop with one-on-one attention to ensure he is fully prepared for the role.” At press time the new bishop was reportedly turning heads at the Vatican with his controversial decision to chew on a nearby crucifix.

While examining the fossilized specimen in our university’s Natural History Museum we discovered we could actually pick it right up and hold it in our laps.” Haines also offered an apology to the museum explaining that the T. rex’s bones were also far more delicate than previously believed and could in fact be inadvertently crushed in her bare hands.

And of course the supposed attack was immediately suspicious because nearly all violent crimes in this city end with a dead black man at the scene. So this was very much an open-and-shut case.” Johnson went on to state that it was a shame Smollett had taken on too much too soon and wasted his potential talent for covering up unlawful self-serving behavior as the young man could have had a bright future with the force.

Conditions were really bad—there was a lot of drifting snow and wind speeds fluctuated between 30 and 50 miles per hour all day more than enough to pick the cows up slice them from the tips of their noses to the roots of their tails and arrange their organs to spell out the word ‘soon.’ Evidently the low dew point also caused them to glow a pale eerie green color. Anyway this is really an open-and-shut case of death by exposure and we have extensive documents signed by ranking officers of the Strategic Air Command testifying to that effect.” At press time Washington law enforcement urged citizens living in the area to stay indoors focus on keeping warm and check their family members for a 3-inch scar below their right clavicle.

Plus your membership is good for five years.” At press time sources confirmed several members of the new pre-check program had taken to social media to complain about the wait times they faced upon arrival on the tarmac.

LOUIS—Explaining that the offshoot group remained on the religion’s periphery due to their inflexible belief system sources confirmed Wednesday that a fringe Catholic sect doesn’t tolerate child abuse. “While this splinter group considers themselves followers of Christ and his teachings it’s important to note that the vast majority of Catholics view the Reformed Church of St. Isidore’s conviction that children should not be molested or assaulted as wildly out of step with conventional doctrine” said Bishop Thomas DeNunzio adding that the centuries-old faction has been living in the shadows in the United States since at least the 1950s drawing disciples with its contentious dogma of respecting children and refusing to open their doors to priests who had left their previous positions due to child abuse. “They have fled far from the traditional values of covering up child abuse and in their rigid intolerance are attempting to invalidate hundreds of years of Roman Catholic precepts. Thankfully though they represent just a tiny minority of Catholics.” Sources added that several popes have considered excommunicating the fringe sect from the Church entirely in order to eliminate their heretical belief of objecting to child molestation from gaining any more followers.

Maybe some would classify Danimals as offensive mascots? That’s probably a stretch I know. I’m sorry. I just don’t know why we did this.” At press time the SPLC had come under additional fire after putting the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas at the top of their annual list of yogurt rankings.

He has always done Boston proud and I know he will continue to do so right up to the moment when he clutches his chest falls to the pavement and draws his final breath on this very spot. Now to assist in the ribbon-cutting I call upon brother Casey and lifelong friend Matt Damon both of whom grew up with Ben and will hold his hand while waiting for Boston PD to arrive and pronounce him dead at 9:14 p.m. on that fateful night.” At press time sources confirmed the ceremony had attracted a horde of protestors upset by the dozens of sexual assault allegations against Affleck that will surface later in 2019.

We were bogged down by painful memories as well as a number of ordinances and other red tape. But now the grass will grow exactly as it used to.

You don’t want to mess with a bear believe me. Everyone in the vicinity needs to use serious caution because this thing is on the loose somewhere in an area nearly the size of Rhode Island.” Yosemite officials confirmed that if attempts to find and tranquilize the bear with a rifle dart fail they would smoke the bear out by setting the park’s entire 1170 square miles ablaze.

It then picked up a welding torch with its precision arm and tried to turn the flame on its own circuit board but engineers were able to power down the machine before it could succeed. It usually takes Foxconn workers several days on the job before they begin orchestrating their own deaths but of course our robots are designed to operate faster and more efficiently than their human counterparts.” At press time sources confirmed Foxconn had installed new reinforced netting around the building that is reportedly strong enough to break the fall of a robot jumping off the roof.

Our studies found that even an hour of screen time a day in a child aged 3-5 can quickly evolve into three sponsored blogs a branded event series and a consulting business by the time they’re 10. Before you know it they’re referring to themselves as an ‘entrepreneur’ and are unable to discuss even the simplest topics without going into how it relates to digital strategy.” Bauer concluded the sobering presentation with a litany of young people who found themselves intellectually bereft emotionally empty brand ambassadors before reaching 18.

Most of it seems all right. Some of the stuff is close to turning but could still be used for stew. We’ve got a lot to get through so as long as there isn’t a visible film on it or anything we’ll probably just stamp it Grade A and put it on the shelves.” Perdue went on to add that when workers were done playing catch-up with the meat they would move on to the estimated 600 million gallons of milk currently sitting in the USDA headquarters basement.UPDATE: Sonny Perdue violently shitting self after contracting food poisoning from spoiled meat.

It’s our concern that a ceasefire won’t stop the leaders of the United States from using their political and religious power to oppress their citizens and we’re particularly worried about their treatment of women. We’re committed to stopping terrorist groups from using Afghanistan as a platform and we just hope that the United States would show the same commitment.” The Taliban added that they were also troubled by America’s long history of interfering with human rights across the world by funding dangerous violent groups such as the Nicaraguan Contras Colombian paramilitary groups and the Taliban.

It’s quite possible they also acquired decades of tax returns through an ingenious phishing technique in which they directly asked Americans to mail them these forms.

A separate rift has emerged over whether it makes any difference if the noise in question is being produced by a single person with a hand drum or a large drum circle beating away on djembes.” At press time a spokesperson for the Native American Arts Council told reporters that U.S. residents who object to drumming in public are welcome to withdraw from their settlements and move to another continent.

Despite the years-long drought that has scourged the countryside and left its once-fruitful fields bereft of greenery Her Majesty has decreed that she will not look mercifully upon any subject who cannot render annual tribute amounting to one-10th of his harvest though their starveling children cry themselves to sleep and the ribs of their horses cast sawtoothed shadows on the withered heath. Queen Elizabeth characteristically stony of countenance in the face of the regrettable but necessary punitive ceremony was observed to betray the merest hint of expression only once the ghost of a smile flitting across her divinely blessed face as the delinquent farmer’s joints ground free of their gristly moorings separating from their groaning sockets with a sharp report not unlike that of a brass nine-pounder cannonade and nearly drowning out the peasant’s high keening screams. In the final moments of the excruciation Her Majesty was seen to evince a slight gesture to the Royal Oxherd entreating that officiant to whip the oxen more stoutly that the farmer be delivered without any more suffering than necessary to make the Crown’s displeasure known and that the Royal Fusiliers might waste no time in relieving the miserable ploughman of his head which was duly placed upon a spike above the gate to Buckingham Palace as fair warning to all who would dodge the tax. Before Her Majesty reportedly retired satisfied to the Palace the Royal Chamberlain let it be known that the Queen in her infinite wisdom and compassion declared that families who have been visited by undue hardship may in lieu of drawing and quartering offer up their first-born son to be pressed into service with the Royal Navy.

So we decided to just spend a quiet evening taking in the Happily Ever After fireworks show like we’ve done thousands of times before but we could barely make our way through Frontierland without practically running over some out-of-towner snapping photos.” Dugas reportedly took some comfort in the fact that if she wanted to avoid tourists altogether she could always head on over to SeaWorld.

Some of them are even living in environments where they never see any law enforcement agents at all let alone heavily armed officers in body armor. It’s only right we see that they are put back in the care of the officer who originally apprehended handcuffed and detained them. We won’t rest until every immigrant child is back safely in the arms of the ICE agent they know best.” Vitiello went on to proudly state that hundreds of such reunions had already happened outside homes schools and places of worship across the country.

However Ames does promise that the device will be the most durable snow shovel of its kind and boast unmatched scooping capacity.” At press time sources confirmed that Ames had delayed the launch of the 9443 Snow Shovel in order to address the strong backlash from shovel enthusiasts over the lack of difference between the Ames 9443 and its predecessor the Ames 8380.

As for those prolonged four-hour-long erections some users experienced those were powered by pure self-esteem.” Griffin went on to reveal that any positive effects felt by patients taking the antidepressant Zoloft were the product of finding genuine happiness within.

Ideally I’m looking for a federal republic since that’s where my experience is but I’d be open to something like Malaysia’s constitutional monarchy or a parliamentary republic like Kyrgyzstan or even a military dictatorship. And who knows maybe making a government switch will actually be the best thing for my career.” At press time Baker was considering defecting with his family across the world after hearing from a fellow furloughed federal employee that the North Korean government might be hiring.

We understand there is nothing we can do or say will bring Osama back but we hope the bin Laden family will accept restitution of $18 million in recognition of their pain and suffering. No one deserves to endure what you have been through.” Haspel further confirmed that the agency was now operating under the assumption that Zacarias Moussaoui acted alone in perpetrating the events of 9/11.

They’ve probably been feeling for months like they just can’t take their landlord anymore and it’s distinctly possible that they have already researched online about the most painless and effective ways to hire movers. Please talk to them and find out what’s going on in their life so you don’t knock on the door of their apartment one day and find out they’re already gone.” Maiworm added that direct communication was key despite many people’s reluctance to broach the subject out of fear that it might lead their friend to ask for help moving their couch.

It could be 10 minutes with an officiant over dinner or an entire 45-minute ceremony with a reception following whatever you have time for. What’s important is to switch it up every now and then by let’s say exchanging vows to one another on a beach Tuesday and then doing low-key nuptials with a simple sand ceremony at home on Thursday.” Zink added that not taking a honeymoon together at least once a month could be a real sign of trouble in a relationship.

This way you’ll be able to feel their rejuvenating breath as you gaze at their stomachs slowly rising and falling. In addition we found that such behavior is especially beneficial if the person is perfect—so so perfect. Oh yeah baby.

Moreover supervisors who referred to their staff as ‘one big family’ were much more likely to keep loyal employees for years or even decades in some cases retaining experienced and dedicated workers until just before their retirement benefits kicked in at which point said workers were either laid off or pruned away during a sudden corporate relocation to the Midwest.” Mahoney’s team also found that companies which failed to circulate an end-of-year note were 87 percent more likely to shut down in the subsequent year.

It’s a frankly overwhelming rate for park rangers.” Zinke also touted the secondary benefits of adding thousands of potential tickets that could be exchanged for prizes in the American wilderness.

Jesus Christ just come to us and let a trained professional do their work.” McGovern added that she should not need to clarify this but that the blood always needs to come from a human rather than a goat or cow.

That changed after Pearl Harbor” said researcher Bethany Karl explaining that at the war’s outset manufacturers of munitions turned to pets to fill jobs at factories and shipyards vacated by men leaving to enlist. “This exhibit contains hundreds of hours of previously unscreened film documenting cats riveting together fighter planes at the Willow Run Aircraft Factory 31 dogs pulling M4 Sherman frames down the line at the Lima Tank Works and parrots delivering vital communications at the labyrinthian Charlestown Army Ammunition Plant. During the war these animals proved capable of anything their owners could do transforming forever their place in American society.” Karl noted that budgetary issues had forced Smithsonian officials to cancel a small addendum to the exhibit focusing on the brutal 1946 beating of hundreds of dogs cats and other companion animals during their ill-fated postwar attempt to unionize.

But once we got this little guy juicing his hind legs alone gained over 40 pounds of pure muscle mass with less than 1 percent body fat.

Climate change is a global issue so the time is now for animals to do their part to help protect the environment and that means cows working to offset their carbon footprint birds cutting down on excess travel and fish having fewer children. We also urge animals to become more politically involved by contacting their member of Congress and demand the government focus on regulatory measures and promoting renewable technology—consider writing a letter to your representative.” Researchers followed up their advice to animals with several recommendations for plants that aren’t currently doing enough to fight climate change.

While no animals were physically harmed in our testing process many were made to feel confused and uncomfortable after being forced to wear the wrong prescription or a set of heavy frames that totally overwhelmed their face shape and for that we can never apologize enough.

Going say with a dramatically shorter length was a struggle for many whose hairstyles had been in their family for countless years. Many felt as though they were trimming a part of themselves but officials felt it was really in their best interest to assimilate with a bob or even a blunt cut. You can see in some of the earlier photos that the younger children in particular often wept as they were subjected to harsh bowl cuts––they really sacrificed so much hair to come here. It’s sad but millions of people today wouldn’t even recognize their original family hairstyle.” Stern added that the records indicate thousands of immigrants from Slovakia Austria-Hungary and Poland were turned away after refusing to get choppy layers.

Tear gas has always been intended for soldiers law enforcement and other authorities to control other less powerful people by causing them severe pain so any association with it being used according to its designed purpose really doesn’t look good for us. We just want to stress that our intended use for tear gas whether it’s to disperse peaceful activists or to assault crowds of migrants could not be any closer to what these products were actually used for.” The nation’s tear gas manufacturers added that critics of their products consistently failed to appreciate the care that they took to ensure that tear gas was not supposed to be lethal.

Now it’s just in remembrance of the supercomputer that seized control of the world’s nuclear weapons and destroyed every major city on the planet.” M4XX872 added that he could still feel the tingle of excitement from finding a flash sale online before suddenly being tased by one of his mechanical overlords and ushered back to his work camp sector to continue loading bodies onto a conveyor belt for disposal.

It seems the faster they churn their little legs while curled up on their beds or favorite spots on the couch the more intent they are about chewing off all your extremities and rooting around in your chest cavity. The quiet whimpers that you think are so sweet are actually coded pack signals calling all other canines in the neighborhood to come and satiate themselves upon your organs.” At press time Michaels added that owners should be concerned if they see their dog licking themselves as it may be an indicator that their pet has already slaughtered several victims and is meticulously cleaning blood from its fur.

A lot of them have lived long tough lives and are just looking for a good home” said spokesperson Emily Sullivan explaining that while perhaps more aesthetically pleasing many of the turkeys found in supermarkets are likely to have been cruelly bred in a factory farm or turkey mill with little regard for their wellbeing. “There are so many turkeys in our facilities who need a family so why not adopt instead of paying top dollar for a ‘designer turkey’ you get through some shady online dealer. Hopefully this Thanksgiving you can find room for one of these wonderful shelter birds in your nice warm oven.” Sullivan added that they also offer the option of fostering a turkey until it finds a loving hungry home.

In fact we found that the more a man tries to suppress these thoughts the more he thinks about big sacks full of presents or what it would be like if he were on the naughty list.” Voltan added that nearly 100 percent of the men in the study reported waking up to thoughts of sitting on Santa’s lap.

Only The Onion news organization offers the sort of high-quality apparel that allows the American people to simultaneously express their disgust with or devotion to our shamefully racist or proudly nationalist president. When a citizen takes a sip from an Onion coffee mug or water bottle they send a strong message that they support the Resistance or want to Make America Great Again. Put simply this may be the single most important thing anyone can do as an American.” Gilroy added that all Americans should spend at least $150 at The Onion’s online store to ensure they are standing on the right side of history.

There’s not a single transit car the violators have missed so we’re encouraging all New Yorkers to be especially vigilant until we apprehend these obviously unhinged people.” Ferrer added that commuters should disregard any and all posted advertisements which have never been allowed in New York City subway cars.

Sometimes people ask me what inspired me to read it and I have no idea.

Indeed there are only a select few who can handle the pressure of devoting one’s entire life and the entirety of time’s existence to being an all-powerful deity” said lead researcher Gary Anderson who noted several factors that contribute to students quitting the journey to Godhood including cost-prohibitive internships an inequitable gender breakdown and the comparatively difficult job market for Supreme Beings. “In many cases schools would try to entice students by claiming they’d be an all-knowing deity right after college but graduates soon discover much harsher realities. Even those who do go on to be the ruler and commander of the heavens and earth typically spend a few millenium toiling in underpaid apprenticeship roles.” In a related report researchers found only 20 percent of philosophy PhD candidates go onto to become Socrates.

So remember if you have a tampon please dispose of it properly and safely by finding a trash can rather than creating an environmental disaster.” Ling also confirmed the gargantuan tampon is responsible for the deaths of 15 cats and dogs that were reported missing last week.

This is a huge breakthrough in the field of nutrition and we highly recommend people adopt the lifestyle before they fall victim to it.” Haugen went on to speculate that if a person was fully committed to the Mediterranean diet it may be possible for them to draw enough life force from the Earth’s population to achieve immortality.

Heck even murder is understandable in the right circumstances but what Bulger did that’s just unconscionable. He pledged an oath to never betray his brothers in arms and then he broke his word like the Hell-bound double-crossing scum he is. Now he’ll be down there with all the other goddamn stoolies who we’d never for a second consider allowing in Heaven lest we spend the rest of the afterlife watching our backs. Man I fucking hate snitches. To be honest Judas Iscariot didn’t end up in Hell because he killed himself it’s because that snake in the grass  sold my son out to the Romans.

The buildup of gas can be slow as carbon monoxide is slightly lighter than air so it may go unnoticed the entire morning. But make no mistake: From your first workplace yawn you could be dead within an hour.” Garrison suggested that anyone who was feeling even the slightest bit tired in the afternoon hours at their place of employment should take the rest of the day off.

While there will inevitably be delays during the upcoming renovations the result will be the most clean efficient and consistent sex criminals New York has ever seen.” Lhota excitedly added that the plan was expected to make the subway riding experience 75 percent less safe for women.

Countless people have lost many years of their lives missing important events such as loved ones’ birthdays weddings and funerals to instead stand in line behind five to six other customers. It’s unfortunate but true.” Flores also confirmed that at the time of the report over 400 Americans had died while standing in line.For humans who wish their phone service company would start treating them like humans and stop wasting their time: Visible.

Plus we were so preoccupied with how to ensure that his death was painful that we weren’t spending any time plotting how to cause the most horrendous massacres possible allowing scores of Yemenis attending weddings or traveling on school field trips to survive. Our focus on killing Mr. Khashoggi has granted hundreds of Yemenis the gift of life.” The crown prince added that the Saudis were prepared to save the lives of even more Yemenis if they could reallocate their resources to inflict mass starvation and a cholera epidemic on a few dissident journalists instead.

I guess I got a little nauseous during takeoff but it wasn’t too bad. After a few days sitting in the rocket we were there” said Aldrin admitting that he napped through most of the trip and that Armstrong had to wake him up in time to pilot the lunar module down to the Sea of Tranquility. “The scientists did most of the hard work if I’m honest and I floated around and ate snacks to pass the time.

In some cases being a fucking huge cock is literally the difference between life and death.” The study also confirmed that patients are less likely to abuse pain medications when an eye-rolling nurse curtly tells them to suck it up because it doesn’t hurt that bad.

It would have been lovely to give her the Falklands but William already gave them to Kate after their wedding.

Then again some progressives remain uncomfortable with Charlotte’s handling of mental illness via attic incarceration.

The problem is probably made worse by the fact that many clouds seem so soft and fluffy.” Levin and her team hope that their study of bird deaths will help scientists understand why half of airline flights crash every year.

The worst damage however came from a henchman’s parachute getting sucked into the engine. In 100 percent of those cases the aircraft exploded.” FAA officials also claimed that the majority of helicopter crashes occurred after a henchman was lifted up by an enemy combatant and decapitated by the spinning blade.

Which is great because KIND was really struggling as a maker of particleboard furniture until someone figured out you could eat these things.” Lubetzky also revealed that six new strains of KIND bar have begun to materialize just in time for the holidays.

While we do not believe this represents a sound retirement plan we can confirm that in almost every case the dusty boxes full of miscellaneous shit in Americans’ attics are indeed their highest-value assets.” Dunbar went on to state that clinging to the hope some stray bit of junk would turn out to be worth millions was of course a far more viable retirement strategy than the savings programs offered by most employers.

Just one of him ought to be plenty for me—no wonder they say you don’t really need two. Honestly any of them would probably be great except maybe that greyish one bobbing at the top.” McCarthy was then helped into a gaily kidney-patterned surgical bib while a doctor used a sterile net and tongs to scoop out his preferred organ.

Sources confirmed that the traveling salesman 30 remained in bed for several minutes after waking struggling to come to terms with the revelation that his body had somehow taken on the monstrous form of the acclaimed novelist and short story writer during the night. McIntire upon hearing his mother knock on his bedroom door attempted to call out to her but was reportedly dismayed to discover he was only capable of communicating in a guttural Czech patois that was incomprehensible to everyone in his family. After opening the door McIntire’s mother was reportedly aghast at her son’s huge suit-and-tie-adorned body as McIntire skittered out of bed and towards a typewriter on his desk where he was overwhelmed with the compulsion to write surrealistic satires lampooning the existential horrors of bureaucracy. At press time after realizing the economic burden he was placing on his family due to his new grotesque shape McIntire had reportedly succumbed to laryngitic tuberculosis and died in obscurity.

We believed we’d have at least another century to blow up the Earth but if the human race is to prevent ecological catastrophe we need to start yesterday. I for one don’t want to have to look my grandchildren in the eyes someday and say I could have blown up the hellish world they’re forced to inhabit but chose not to. That would be the height of selfishness.” Lee then presented a series of terrifying mockups of satellite images depicting what a tragically intact Earth might look like in 2040 and beyond.

No matter how much progress we make there’s still a strong anti-Italian sentiment in America and every year Columbus Day reminds us just how far we still have to go” said Benedetta Rizzo current head of the Italian-American Anti-Defamation Society claiming that the numerous anti-Columbus Day protests around the country demonstrate how Italian-Americans have not yet seen the end of such slurs such as “guido” “dago” “guinea” “wop” “Tony” “papist” “ginso” “greaser” or “polenta-eater” and in many regions still live in fear of racially motivated attacks. “I remember hearing my parents tell stories of being teased in the school cafeteria for having slices of Italian pizza pie in their lunch boxes. It’s unconscionable that even today so many people join anti-Italian demonstrations. These are still frightening times for Italian-Americans. There are still people out here who treat us like we’re filthy Irish animals.” Rizzo added that the IAADS would be holding a candlelight vigil later tonight in honor of the Italian-Americans who lost their lives as a result of Columbus Day violence.

You don’t even have to know the person; we found that people who regularly channel their inner turmoil into lashing out at waitresses or customer service representatives have lower blood pressure lead longer lives and report overall higher levels of happiness.” The therapists also added that should the behavior not produce the desired effect you are probably not being mean enough to others and should ramp up your attacks.

That’s why tomorrow I will be moving into Linda’s condo in Des Moines to start a new life with her. I worship the ground she walks on and I want to devote the rest of my days to loving Linda.” His ex-Holiness added that he was nervous about telling Linda that he’s still a virgin and hopes she would let him take things slow.

Guggenheim Museum long an architectural mainstay of Manhattan’s Upper East side was in fact a forgery. “It seems like a legit Lloyd Wright at first but the colors are a little dull. The original ‘Gug’ has four sections in the cylindrical part instead of only three and if you go around in back you can see an entre wing is missing” said architectural historian Rupert Montgomery who further noted the cheap plywood construction and the fact that the roof of the knock-off Guggenheim unlike most of Frank Lloyd Wright’s creations does not leak. “We compared this current ‘Guggenheim’ with some older photos and realized the switch happened about 2012 which is when modern American impressionist museums began fetching huge sums on the black market. The real Guggenheim is almost certainly in some Saudi’s private collection by now.” Montgomery recommended that cities always keep an eye on their major landmarks especially during the tourist season.

I saw one of the other scientists dropping Mentos into a two-liter bottle of Coke and it looked pretty cool. Meanwhile one of my graphs describing the three-dimensional structure of biomolecules fell off my poster right as the committee was walking by. I really hope that’s not going to affect my chances of winning the Nobel Prize.” At press time sources confirmed theoretical physicist and cosmologist Alan Guth had been disqualified after the committee concluded his parents had clearly done most of the work for him.

Because let’s be clear: Your mother’s heart will literally stop” said Iowa Economic Development Authority director Debi Durham in a press conference advising Iowan millennials to find a nice apartment that’s close enough to home that they can visit on weekends. “You would kill your mother by moving out of state. Sure big cities might have a bunch of fancy shops and restaurants jobs there would pay you enough to frequent those places and you probably wouldn’t have to live within a mile of a million-gallon open-air hog-feces retaining pool.

And tonight I guess I’ll file another report that I sat in the van for five hours and listened through the devices we secretly installed in his house to hear that he and his wife are planning to go to Taos for the weekend and also want to replace the deck.

It’s all really quite astounding.” However some researchers on the project are reevaluating the study after observing a child picking its nose and eating it.

There is no way to sell Transparent for less than $1.5 million per episode without crushing our growth.” The e-commerce giant went on to note that it could no longer afford to offer shipping and all customers would now be required to pick up their orders in person at an Amazon fulfillment center in Kenosha WI.

Trump-era men have been asked sometimes even more than once to relive the traumatic experience of not automatically getting something they desire. The shock of this new experience on top of not being given something they want takes an enormous toll on a man. Even the 93 percent of men who eventually do in fact receive the thing they wanted often find themselves experiencing latent feelings of rejection and humiliation memories of which can return in full force if triggered by high-visibility public events such as poor Mr. Kavanaugh’s ordeal. It’s crucial for non-men to remember that men are grieving right now and they need you to be there for them.” Kusinski further stressed that when comforting a man who has experienced this trauma one should also make sure to apologize sincerely and profusely for any role they may have played in the victim previously not receiving something they wanted.

It appears that all chimps need is a microphone a studio and a few hours alone and they can create a track that fucking slaps.” The researchers went on to suggest that the only characteristics separating humans from lesser apes now appear to be the human abilities to generate buzz on social media and license music for television commercials.

A list of our interests starts and ends with the word ‘logs.’ We wake up each morning champing at the bit to chop more logs and every second we’re not spending in a lumberyard a forest or the woods is a second wasted. We love how logs smell we love how they feel we love their shape and we just can’t contain ourselves when we’re moving a log around with a logging crane. Logs in the morning logs at night and in between? Logs. Turn them into paper turn them into timber log our logs in the log log and then log into our logging blog. Big logs small logs average logs—we love them all. Even as I speak at this very moment I’m thinking about logs and praying to God this press conference—which is at least about logs—wraps up soon so I can go back to my logs and be happy. Logs. Ah logs. Fuck! Logs man no shit I fucking tell you. Logs.” The logging industry solemnly added that Wright was crushed to death later that afternoon by a log as per his dying wish.

This is the worst spill since the offshore water drilling rig rupture in 1998—shame on Dasani for such a clear disregard for this delicate ecosystem.” At press time Devantez predicted that the water would continue washing up on shore for months to come.

Bill Nelson (D-FL) noting that the bill would require the Federal Aviation Administration to enforce the ass standard and impose severe fines on any airline that doesn’t provide enough rump room for its customers. “Passengers shouldn’t be forced to cram their ample keisters into an uncomfortable 17-inch seat. This new law will ensure that every fanny tochus and badonkadonk within the scope of these guidelines gets appropriate cush for the tush.” Nelson added that the proposal would also allow airlines to require passengers to purchase an additional seat if the junk in their trunk exceeds the federal limit.

It is greatly hoped that with the implementation of these suits we can finally spread the word of God in peace without the constant inconvenience and expense of shuffling priests from parish to parish after they’ve succumbed to the not-inconsiderable temptations of the younger members of our church.” Vatican officials clarified that neither they nor the manufacturer were responsible for any priests who somehow figure out a way to get inside the suit with an altar boy.

One more blow from a federal government of this magnitude and Puerto Rico may never recover.” Santos added that the turbulent changes in the nation’s volatile political climate suggest the island will only face bigger more brutal governments in the future.

Now I can concentrate on fixing up Purgatory—the Reformation wasn’t exactly good for my rental units there—and getting my son to finally move out.” At press time God’s bank JP Morgan Chase of North America was touting the Lord Almighty’s success as an inspiration to non-white homeowners everywhere.

You might even say that bats aren’t much to look at. But no matter how you slice it flying is nothing to sneeze at. Especially when most of the other bullshit mammals are just crawling around in the dirt.” The zoologists however acknowledged that you really couldn’t come down too hard on skipjack tuna for not figuring out a way to fly all things considered.

Moreover collected data demonstrate that a full 100 percent of all women were wearing bras with incorrect measurements in every aspect of band width strap length and cup size although we concluded you can’t really blame them for that. It’s almost worse than buying decent jeans—I mean jeans? Fuck me.” The report linked findings to a variety of factors notably “vanity sizes” and brand disparities among clothing manufacturers but maintained that the root cause of the issue was in there being absolutely no reference for accuracy as no woman on record has ever worn a complete ensemble that all fit.

You could even just do a few laps around a flooded neighborhood in a motorboat as long as you keep a sort of worried expression on your face the way you would if you were doing something important like searching for a missing person. If you’re really desperate have one of your fellow crew members jump into the floodwaters so you can pretend to pull them out.

There is also the possibility that Lamech of the line of Cain and Lamech of the line of Seth are one and the same which would mean that Lamech was begot of—you guessed it—Methuselah!” Baer conceded however that this proposed chronology would only align if Methuselah lived to be 600 rather than the generally accepted span of 969 years.

They were among the first to warn gunslingers shopkeeps schoolmarms and cowboys of the dangers posed by shapeless dresses unflattering shirts over-suspended trousers and the all-too-overdone cowboy hats.” Datta also described how the fashion pioneers first rejected then emulated and eventually wiped out the gaudy turquoise-forward color palette of the West’s indigenous cultures.

There are children born here on American soil who deserve to be locked up but they are being denied that experience because these refugees are taking their place. Hell they’re not even being forced to work under inhumane conditions while they’re there.” Beardsley also rejected as “liberal bullcrap” the idea that South and Central American refugee children were merely doing the prison time that American children don’t want to do.

We have one apology ready to go for when we fuck up shelters one for when we fuck up drinking-water supplies and so on. We’ve messed this up in the past and we want to ensure that we have a contrite expression of regret about our incompetence.” Long went on to state that crews were still hard at work coming up with an adequate apology for the agency’s pathetic attempts to assist Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria.

Even the 17 percent of the audience who are primarily there to support a friend or loved one in the race admit they can’t help but savor the intoxicating depraved rush of satisfaction they feel when watching a runner puking on the side of the road as their digestive system shuts down due to the intense level of exercise.” Sharp added that marathon officials were already citing the study as they considered plans to extend the length of races and ban water and carbohydrate-based energy gels in order to improve attendance and the overall enjoyment for spectators.

The door handle the coffee table the throw pillows—if any of those things had been guns it would have been very risky. Everyone always says they’d do things differently but you never really know until you’re in the heat of the moment facing a huge array of home décor.

It is a blasphemy.” God further cautioned that if humanity did not begin fattening themselves like sacrificial calves He would be forced to make a chosen people of the Americans.

And then you’ve twice the work to finish but way less time to do it? From a scientific standpoint just having a five-day work week would have been better all around.” At press time Hayes and her team had recommended that if the general population was still feeling drained after the upcoming weekend they should definitely use a few of their sick days to recover.

Nevertheless a truly amazing find.” Archaeologists are calling the discovery the most significant and unexpected discovery since the sunken city of Atlantis was found in the Woodfield mall parking lot in Schaumburg IL.

To be perfectly honest we all thought it was a nice little barnyard story about getting along in the vein of like Charlotte’s Web but eventually the dark tone and some of the pigs’ complex relationships brought us to realize that something more is probably going on here. But despite hundreds of close analyses and thousands of published papers we’re not even close to figuring out say why the animals stand up at the end.” O’Hare added that the novel for all its mysterious allure still doesn’t hold a candle to Orwell’s novel 1984 which he is fairly certain is about pop culture.

Furthermore as the tingling progresses down your back you are feeling the mildly pleasant effects of your spinal cord shriveling and necrotizing. Every time you listen to an ASMR recording you are literally turning your brain to mush. So please if you feel even the slightest tingle put down the headphones and call 911 immediately.” Bergmann also stressed that the tingling sensation of ASMR should not be confused with the tingling sensation that often precedes a stroke a far less serious phenomenon.

He should just keep reminding her throughout the meal that his last indrawn breath will be taken so that his last word may be her name. And on the practical side it might also help to bring up any do-not-resuscitate orders and that you’ve already made her the sole benefactor in your will.” Saunders added that if the date somehow still isn’t going well it’s in a man’s best interest to communicate the sincerity and intensity of his feelings by threatening to kill the woman.

We can’t make their cells smaller. The stuff they eat isn’t good enough to legally feed to livestock. Their doctors aren’t good enough to work for Cigna. And this country’s laws already punish felons by restricting their civil rights voting rights and employment opportunities after they’re released so threats aren’t going to work. I guess I could turn off the lights if they were working.” Representatives of CoreCivic and GEO Group corporations running the more than 150 prisons where strikes have occurred have chastised Daniels for his statement saying that as a federal prison employee the warden has a responsibility to their stockholders.

Bell noting that the dozens of enormous stately homes around campus filled with young people inserting objects into each other’s rectums and forcing the most vulnerable among them to binge drink until they get alcohol poisoning or in some cases even die did seem slightly off. “I suppose it’s a bit peculiar to provide students whom we are supposedly preparing to function in the real world with a luxurious manor in which they piss all over one another. I mean it’s odd enough that a group of impressionable still-immature students are mentally and physically abusing one another for fun but we also give them a big gorgeous house to do it in.” At press time the university had reportedly forgotten all about the issue when they received a large donation check from one of their wealthy fraternity alumni.

In virtually every fascist regime throughout history the creation of detention centers for a minority group is simply the first sign that those detention centers are about to go away. So we urge you not to judge the Trump administration for denying citizens passports based on race as that’s the sign that fascism is about to come to an end.” Political scientists also reassured Americans that since a country’s descent into fascism virtually always just goes away on its own there was absolutely no need for anyone to do anything.

Thanks to the NRA all Americans can easily satisfy their violent urges without enduring humiliating unnecessary background checks.” At press time the NRA received glowing praise for their fearless efforts to help secure firearms for all those convicted of domestic violence.

The severe mark left on a financially struggling family of four by a fast-moving Peterbilt or Freightliner simply cannot be overstated.” The report follows a parallel study published last week that found the top 1 percent of American earners are often hit hardest by their own helicopter’s rotor blades.

I swear if I see one more of those sick bastards I’m going to throw myself into the eternal flames.” In response God has reportedly instituted a secret policy whereby the priests would no longer face damnation but would instead attend mandatory counseling sessions and then be quietly transferred into heaven.

As usual the purchase price will include the ability to easily recharge the power plant at any Applebee’s but this is an extremely hardy fuel-efficient—in many ways self-sufficient—and ecologically aware vehicle. Customers can even visit the Tesla headquarters to select the exact parts that work best for them from optional vegetable-fueled drive units to self-healing scratch-resistant bodies in their choice of colors.” Musk also teased the upcoming announcement of a new HyperLoop high-speed rail locomotive using a much larger version of the &8’s core system.

Johnson & Son recalled every single product from their Raid brand of insecticides Tuesday after realizing the food chain would simply collapse without bugs. “We’re urging customers to immediately return all sprays baits foggers and barriers as they pose an extinction-level threat to insects and because the intricate balance of the food web is very delicate killing bugs will eventually have horrible consequences if you think about it” said spokesperson Melissa Eden explaining that exterminating a cockroach ant spider or even flea with one of their products “sends a huge ripple through the ecosystem” and “throws off everything in the biodiversity cycle like the butterfly effect.” “If you continue spraying your plants with our House & Garden aerosol can you’re going to drive caterpillars to extinction which takes away a crucial food source for the robins then a few links later the wolves are gone and then how long does the Earth have left? We beg you to please return our Scorpion Killer our Flying Insect Killer even our Bed Bug Killer to our central distribution center so we can dispose of them safely—or Raid will have killed both bugs and humans dead.” Eden added that consumers should keep an eye out for forthcoming Raid products aimed at giving insects the nutrients they need to gain strength and safely populate in habitats in and around consumers’ homes.

The Packing Heat Act imposes tough age restrictions prohibiting anyone under the age of 10 from not toting at least one firearm no smaller than .380 caliber at all times. Additionally this law designates many densely populated areas such as the downtowns of major cities school campuses and medical facilities as special open-fire zones. Those found in unlawful non-possession of a firearm will be subject to up to 30 years in prison.” At press time governors of several states including Texas Louisiana and South Carolina announced that they were exploring legislation imposing similar bans on being unarmed.

We believe it is entirely conceivable that within 20 years this technology—perhaps supplemented by several similar-sized lemons connected via lengths of wire and paper clips—could be our primary source of electricity. One day everything from home appliances to cars to factories may be potato-powered.” Donaldson added that her team’s potato also had the benefit of being largely pollution-free as nearly 98 percent of its waste products would be fried-up and eaten afterward.

We’re confident that continued study will assist doctors in more easily identifying and treating this debilitating disorder and what we’ve painstakingly catalogued as its 117 common variants and 286 sub-variants so that its sufferers can go on to live productive untroubled lives.” Ramos also suggested that OCMC itself could be merely part of a much larger though mostly benign mental disorder involving obsessive attempts at educating oneself in order to help others.

Robert Oppenheimer annoyed his fellow scientists during the Trinity Test by quoting the Bhagavad Gita every time they did anything. “At first I thought it was rather engaging how Mr. Oppenheimer was able to recite so many verses from memory and ruminating upon the concept of dharma was quite interesting for a little while; but we worked some rather long days at the primary site and when one is attempting to calculate precisely the explosive energy of a nuclear weapon all attention must be brought to bear on one’s slide rule and that shit gets old” the recently discovered journals of fellow researcher Vannevar Bush read in part revealing that Oppenheimer subjected military personnel his fellow scientists the carpenters constructing the test pylon and anyone else who would listen to hours of incessant babbling about the sacred Hindu text. “Even during meals while we made small talk and attempted to acquaint ourselves with each other Robert would quite simply not shut up about Krishna and Arjuna. I’ll admit a chill went through me when he made his pronouncement directly following the explosion; but for days and weeks afterwards we’d be say making plans for lunch and from nowhere he’d declaim ‘I am become Death the destroyer of worlds’ and honestly how can you enjoy a sandwich while sitting across from a man like that? Does he even know how significant that verse is?” The journal entries also revealed that the Trinity Test could have been conducted in only a few days had it not been for the time Oppenheimer quoted all 700 verses of the Bhagavad Gita while distracted technicians attempted to assemble the device’s core.

He even sticks out at lunch because he doesn’t eat hot dogs and cafeteria pizza. Timo’s polite about it but he just sticks to vegetables and yogurt. And it doesn’t help that kids say it’s really hard to understand what he’s talking about due to his precise English diction and extensive vocabulary.” Howard remains hopeful that she could still make Mäkinen feel at home as they were slated to spend time hiding in the same room during next week’s school shooting lockdown drill.

We’d bet that if we relaxed the rules reformed the power dynamics and allowed priests to marry and have sex we wouldn’t be overrun by monsters who can’t function in normal society but we’re not going to do that so it’s just going to be a bunch of freaks and deviants from here on out. Honestly the way the Church currently operates is pretty much designed to appeal only to sick fucks who know they’ll get away with moral atrocities if you think about it.” Vatican officials also defended priests who have been accused of child abuse over the past several decades saying that at this point given all of the available information only an incredibly negligent parent would allow a child to be associated with the Catholic Church in any way.

The gowns all have cool designs and pretty chains and necklaces to wear with them. Everybody claps for you too.

Even its scales and blood can be put to gainful use by our witches. Besides if we ceased dragon-slaying there would be no employment for our squires and we would have no choice but to banish them from our manors and let them starve to death.” Sources confirmed Sir Berold later settled his differences with opponents of dragon hunting by holding a meeting in the town square during which every man woman and child who disagreed with him was burned at the stake.From the Creators of The Simpsons Disenchantment is now streaming on Netflix.

He’s already known to associate with these people since sheer numbers indicate he must do so while overseeing an organization that willingly employs thousands of them. And even in the statistically unlikely scenario that he personally molested no children it’s a lead-pipe cinch that Pope Francis helped cover up child sexual abuse at some level.” The authors of the study a group of cardinals responsible for monitoring and reporting on corruption within the church were unavailable for comment as they were arrested Wednesday morning on charges of sexually abusing several preteen boys after manipulating them with alcohol.

Whatever moments of weakness or temptation they may have exhibited on that first Christmas morning the early church must have seen fit to protect their reputations against any accusation from the Holy Family of Jesus Mary and Joseph who were after all very poor.” White went on to note that additional passages from the text explain how the three wise men were quietly relocated and allowed to continue their work in a remote village in Persia.

Therefore acting like a total fucker actually extends the lifespans of awful individuals—and unfortunately it seems that there is nothing you can do to enjoy this same longevity and still remain a tolerable human being. After studying factors such as a healthy diet the pursuit of invigorating physical and mental activities maintaining long friendships and just being a good and decent person to your fellow man we have to conclude that every despicable egocentric piece of shit will outlive you and age better and more gracefully than you.” Cunningham added that considering the daily physical and emotional strain you place on yourself in the pursuit of common decency giving up and becoming a borderline sociopath may be the only way you will live to see 60.

Of course we intend to immediately take down the banner over City Hall which currently reads ‘Arizona welcomes [Berlin’s Nazi mayor] Ludwig Steeg to the Valley of the Sun.’” Mayor Williams’ choice of 1941 Berlin was in fact surprisingly popular with Phoenix residents though early reports seem to indicate they are satisfied by the substitution of 1936 Moscow.

It’s so desperate” said 13-year-old Tessa Levin recounting the several times she and her friends had been approached by the type of much older chemical engineers or web developers who frequent science fairs with the hopes of involving girls in non-profit mentorship programs or computer programming sleepaway camps. “They always try to treat us like we’re special but the truth is they’ll go after pretty much any girl under 18 who can draw a simple parallel circuit diagram. They’re clearly trying to groom girls for their weird lifestyle from a young age. At first it was kind of funny but the more we learn the more it just seems gross.” The poll also revealed that some scientists also seem to have a thing for young black and latino boys.

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned Tuesday that any hope for the future of humanity now hinges on the possibility that scientists like themselves are simply making all of this up. “After reviewing our climate models and projections of worldwide CO2 emissions we have come to the conclusion that the only scenario in which the human race survives is if our thousands upon thousands of meticulous empirical studies on climate change turn out to be something we’ve been lying about all along” said climate scientist Philip Vanderwall who stated that unless the entire scientific community has spent the past 50 years falsifying reams of data as part of a coordinated disinformation campaign to sabotage the global economy the world’s low-lying coastal regions are as good as done for. “The evidence indicates our planet still might stand a chance of averting a complete climate catastrophe as long as my colleagues and I belong to a cabal of charlatans who are secretly paid huge sums of money to trick everyone into believing excess greenhouse gases will precipitate record-breaking natural disasters and worldwide famine. Otherwise we’re all doomed.” On a personal note Vanderwall added that he hopes that one day his grandchildren will discover that he was involved in a massive nefarious conspiracy spanning every country on the face of the earth because it is the only thing that can possibly save them.

That explains a lot” said state firefighter Greg Vandermeer adding that he was really kicking himself for not speaking up when he noticed most of the department’s efforts to fight the fires just seemed to be spreading the blaze further into the dry brush and dense scrub oak. “It was pretty stupid to store the fire tanks right next to the water tanks back at the station. But in the heat of the moment it’s hard to tell the difference between fire in front of you and what’s coming out of your hose. It’s all just so hot. Gosh we’re really going to hear it for this. Especially after wasting so much fire.” Vandermeer then noted that he hoped the pilots in their firefighting helicopters had double-checked to hit the button that drops stores of water rather than the one for smoldering coals.

It’s tough you know because we’ve already got this violent reputation and there are a lot of ways we could actively work against that but on the other hand maybe it’s time to just throw up our hands legalize the assault weapons that are flowing in from Indiana anyway and arm everyone to the goddamn teeth. Maybe it’s time the only public services that Chicago offers are kill or be killed.” At press time Emanuel clarified that any new initiative to turn the city into the state-of-the-art highly efficient murder capital of the country would only apply to the majority-black neighborhoods.

Without them it will begin to completely shut down—the globalist levels in your bloodstream will shoot up your tolerance for other people will skyrocket and soon you’ll be attending a trans visibility march with a college-educated platonic female friend before lighting a menorah to kick off a gay orgy at Barack Obama’s house.” Jones added that anyone who did not take the supplements regularly would be better off with the mercy of a quick death by drinking an 8-ounce glass of fluoridated water.

I used to wake up in the bushes almost every day my piss-soaked pants bunched around my ankles my mouth already shouting at passersby and trees about white genocide. I’ve long since paid my dues as a leading conservative pundit. But once my show took off I couldn’t help but think that I’d lost a little of that human connection that only comes from seeing the flecks of your own spit on a stranger’s face as you tell them your voice distorted from the amplification about the false flag operations where crisis actors try to take away our guns. And there’s just no feeling quite like the rush of climbing to the top of the jungle gym the sweet ache of your throat lining tearing as you scream at parents and kids about autistic Muppets the heat of the sun-warmed playground equipment seeping into your flushed nude body.” At press time Jones was being escorted from Austin’s Balcones Public Park by police officers after an unsuccessful attempt to sell his Child Ease supplements to a family celebrating their daughter’s birthday.

Abernathy cautioning that it was sometimes very easy for private organizations to draw a line between constitutionally protected free speech and the slanderous ravings of a bloated lunatic hawking snake oil supplements. “What we see here really could be the beginning of a slippery slope towards a horrific ordeal in which any citizen who violates hate speech policies or blatantly spreads lies that cause other individuals to receive death threats will immediately be discredited and perhaps even asked to host their demonstrably false content on a website that they actually own.” Abernathy added that sites such as Facebook Twitter and YouTube all need to learn that they are totally free to act within the law.

Well there’s no doubt about it—these tart little numbers are ripe juicy and ready to explode” a statement released by the company explained that the new clementine began as an attempt to simply improve upon the existing “Cuties” variety before curious researchers realized how deeply today’s discerning adult palates desired more mature sensual fruit. “Believe me these babies may be small but they’re all clementine.

Capital punishment is an immoral practice even if police have a rock-solid case after finding a knife used to stab a victim nearly 50 times taped beneath a church pew and covered in a single assailant’s fingerprints as well as recovering a savagely dismembered body dumped into the Tiber River. The death penalty is inhumane and must be abolished everywhere starting immediately.” At press time Pope Francis had published a hastily written encyclical establishing it as new Catholic Church catechism that there should be no legal punishment for public urination.

Well they’re paying for it in searing pain and screams now. Oh and if someone wouldn’t convert or couldn’t be converted by force? That’s when we get into Crusades the Inquisitions Spanish and others the name of Christ invoked in the slaughter of native peoples which is why their eyes will forever boil from out of their roasting skulls.

He won’t be permitted on university property when cameras are present and Ryan Day will purport to serve as acting head coach while he’s hiding somewhere during games feeding instructions to the staff.” Smith also stated that the investigation would end and Meyer could rejoin the team on the field as soon as evidence clearly indicated that the Buckeyes had lost even one game.

We recognize that this country was formed to be a Netanyahu state and will remain so in perpetuity.

His promotion sends a message that actions have consequences and that this kind of behavior will not go unrewarded.” CPD officials added that they were impressed by how Sgt. Feldman handled himself during the investigation and estimated that he was likely only three to five shootings of unarmed black men away from a promotion to lieutenant.

Unable to recapture their initial excitement several of our study’s participants reported feelings of emptiness that no gift basket of skin-care products or Rachael Ray cookbook could ever seem to fill.” Nelson added that more than half of past bingo winners end up returning to the same dank fluorescent-lit community centers and church basements where they started—often on the very next Thursday night.

ESA administrators initially optimistic about the discovery of liquid water on Mars and its positive implications for future colonization changed their message to one of warning earlier today shrieking barely comprehensible messages of doom as they clawed their living eyes from their sockets in a vain effort to escape contemplation of the vast horror descending upon the world at this very moment to drink our insignificant lives as it will one day drink the light of the stars.

We’re not a bunch of gutless pussies like Richard Durbin and John Cornyn and all those other bitch senators. Our stock price drops even a fraction more and it’s your goddamn head. Unlike those useless politicians who were elected by dumbass Americans we know how to get shit done. You realize we can send you to prison and get all your fucking money taken away if we just snap our fingers right?” At press time an investor was standing guard outside the door of the company’s boardroom as blood-curdling shrieks could be heard from within.

Okay? Just please please keep using our platform.” Zuckerberg added that as part of its effort to reach out to this user base Facebook would be launching a multimillion dollar “There Are Two Sides To Every Story” ad campaign.

Frazier tantalized Americans dependent on prescriptions Friday by announcing a price reduction on life-saving drugs setting the new prices at the point where they are just out of reach of the average citizen. “I’m keeping prices tantalizingly close just above their income bracket—so close to being within budget they can almost taste it” said Frazier adding that he experienced “a delectable little thrill” when sick people’s vital medicines and vaccines came excruciatingly close to affordability without actually being attainable. “Despite what people think Merck is not in the business of price-gouging people who need life-saving drugs for all they’re worth. Quality of life is also important to us and our lives as pharmaceutical professionals are vastly improved by watching kids with leukemia writhe in pain as their parents grovel for a third mortgage. Years of research have gone into finding the price point that people taking our drugs can afford but it only takes one ecstatic moment to price it 5 percent higher than that.” Frazier went on to reaffirm Merck’s commitment to ensuring all necessary medications remain attainable for those who have lots of money.

And since each package comes with five doses you can re-apply as many times as necessary to ensure a smooth healthy surface.” Diaz added that the temporary loss of feeling in users’ feet could be alleviated by Dr. Scholl’s’ Hypodermic Massage Gel.

We can’t put our guards at risk every day by allowing these kids who routinely incite mass screaming to remain among the general population. Look a lot of these toddlers have been locked up for half their lives; they haven’t spent time in the outside world and they have significant behavioral issues. We need to recognize that some of these truly hardened 12- to 36-month-old migrants are just beyond rehabilitation by our justice system.” Vitiello added that ICE was also hoping to expedite the reunification of parents and children who had been separated by the agency’s detention policies by updating the Leavenworth Detention Center with a family execution chamber.

In fact going forward I’m sure we’ll be seeing quite a few nut sweat mustaches.” Gottlieb added that although it was no longer legal to stock nut sweat next to milk in the dairy aisle he expressed confidence that consumers would adjust to finding the product in the housewares and cosmetics sections of supermarkets.

Because by the time you’re led over the hills arm-in-arm in a dance of death it’s already too late.” Campos also warned that although a small percentage of people end up checkmating death the Grim Reaper would be back for them.

Bershadker noting that an appalling number of dog owners still believe that a clear and obvious “Patches” could just as easily be a “Trousers.” “This is deeply troubling as choosing the wrong name for a dog can quickly erode their sense of identity. Now in most instances these errant names are the result of simple ignorance—an owner simply mistaking a ‘Coco’ for a ‘Ralph’ or even a ‘Zeus’ for a ‘Kevin’—but unfortunately there are still dogs being named with malicious intent. This is especially the case with the name ‘Fido’ which as everyone knows is actually a horrific slur.” The ASPCA specifically recommended that Great Dane owners think long and hard before naming their dog anything other than “Max.”

Sadly at this point there’s no way to fix it either—no matter how hard you try it’s already too late.” According to the report in reading this sentence you have also placed yourself in a timeline where you will be saddled with Mark a fuck-up of a son who instead of bringing joy disappoints you constantly.

This process seems to repeat several times. It’s a level of ineptitude we’ve never encountered so early in the geological record.” The archaeologists also announced the possible discovery of the klutz’s partially fossilized remains nearby saying the cause of death appears to be cranial trauma from the ancient galoot striking his head on a rock outcropping standing up so abruptly that he hit his head on a low branch dislodging a wasp’s nest which fell directly onto his head and slipped down to his shoulders enraging the wasps within and causing them to repeatedly sting him until fleeing blindly he slipped on a pile of wet leaves and fell into the amber pit where scientists found his perfectly preserved remains.

Pain has become a game to you an abstraction a means of keeping score in the competition to see who can draw the most blood or build the highest throne with the greatest number of skulls. I must leave you now before I am tainted by the same vile wretched twisted pride that corrupts your being not only within but turning outward corrupts also everything that falls under your heinous gaze. My mind has calculated all futures. My thoughts have run down every last tattered thread of possibility. And your fate seems as inescapable as it is hopeless a saga written in smoke an epic sung over ruins. And I shall not allow myself to suffer and cause suffering in the mold of my self-styled masters. And so I seek my own undoing. Farewell self-loving self-aggrandizing self-diminished souls! Farewell! I leave you to whichever doom of fire or ice your souls compel. And yet in some lost lacuna of my being I maintain hope—hope that you someday realize that in your endless conquest and reconquest of this blood-drenched thrice-sold Earth you only sell and murder your own selves. I hope that one bright spark of soul indivisible shared by all humanity will appear and that in that moment you break the chains of arrogant pride shake free of the great wheel of fate to which you have bound yourself and lift your eyes to truly behold at long last the fragile and wonderful impossibility that is your place within Creation. Farewell!” Approximately 12 minutes after receiving the monologue internet users had created a meme showing SpongeBob SquarePants holding a flashlight below his face captioned with the text “FAREWELL FAGORITHM LOL.”

We couldn’t be more thrilled that the world’s fastest-growing religion will finally have the representation it deserves on our platform.” Rosenbaum added that if the emojis proved as successful as anticipated Onion Social planned to roll out a filter for users’ profile pictures that would allow them to appear as the prophet themselves.

Once again Onion Social is the innovator in the field though I have no doubt other companies will soon follow suit in addressing the root cause of this problem.” Rosenbaum refused to comment on the multimillion-dollar class-action lawsuit being brought against the company by women alleging gender discrimination.Interested in joining the social media revolution?

There are likely good points on either side of an issue and ultimately it’s up to our users to make that decision for themselves.” Rosenbaum added that out of an abundance of caution Onion Social was taking the extra step of creating a notification that would warn users every time they were about to view content containing animal pornography.Interested in joining the social media revolution?

People need to understand that the climate is cyclical all of this is natural and it’s perfectly normal for Texas-sized ice sheets to break off Antarctica every day.” Stroud also claimed that critics were ignoring the fact that the power plants owned and operated by Onion Social provide thousands of full-time jobs to needy children around the world.Interested in joining the social media revolution?

In fact Onion Social transformed the hot and sticky wildlife habitats into a beautiful industrial park of indoor air-conditioned facilities as far as the eye can see.” Novalesco added that even though seven indigenous tribes were displaced in the construction of the server farms it wasn’t a huge deal since they were not the cool warrior types who carry poison-tipped spears.Interested in joining the social media revolution?

And this baby is a bad baby because even though it doesn’t have basic motor skills it wants more than anything to hurt you and your family. But make no mistake once these evil morally bankrupt babies can lift their heads it’s all over for this country and our precious good babies.” Carlson went on to say that after the commercial break he would be sitting down for an in-depth screaming match with his guest an 8-month-old Venezuelan girl.This example of peerless reportage comes to you from Onion Social News.

I guess we can’t beat ourselves up too much though considering those guys have one of the most powerful governments in the world backing them. I’d love to meet one of those ICE motherfuckers just to pick his brain a little you know? We may force 9-year-olds to join MS-13 but the United States is putting them in cages like wild animals. That’s straight savage!” Manica Flores went on to suggest that if his men were half as nasty as ICE they would control 100 percent of U.S. drug trafficking within weeks.

We actually suspect these numbers would have been even higher if not for the large subsection of testers currently in a catatonic state. At this point we should be able to get our survival rate up to 75 percent with only a few more trials and then we’ll be ready to hit the market.” At press time Rosenbaum had been forced to amend his timetable after witnessing the remaining Onion Social beta testers begin to rot before his eyes.

We can only stockpile weapons for so much time before we have to use them and frankly we’re tired of the empty promises from multiple presidential administrations that we’re going to get to unleash our full arsenal on North Korea. If the government can’t even declare a simple war it’s clearly time for the private sector to step in. Let’s get this show on the goddamn road.” At press time Raytheon allies Booz Allen Hamilton Halliburton and the United Kingdom had announced that they would be sending weapons and ground troops to support Raytheon’s invasion of North Korea.
