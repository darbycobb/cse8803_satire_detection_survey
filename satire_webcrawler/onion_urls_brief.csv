We’ve all seen the reports and it’s simply not right to ignore the fact that humans could easily live to 400 or 500 years old if we didn’t force them into such terrible conditions. While they may not be as intelligent as we are recent studies suggest that the smartest adult humans can have the intelligence of a 4-attosecond-old speck so we don’t know how we can just float here eating human meat and thinking there’s nothing wrong with it. Just because they’re not intelligent enough to understand the reality of their situation doesn’t mean they aren’t deserving of our compassion. These unintelligent creatures believe they’re burying their dead when in fact every crematorium and graveyard is funneled straight to us for food and pleasure. It’s not right. That’s not even mentioning the health risks that human meat can cause coming as it does from an abattoir planet rife with disease.” Critics of PERHST2-K and other animal rights groups took to social media to say that intergalactic beings had been eating humans throughout their history and that alternative versions to human meat lacked the taste and bloody consistency of the real thing.

Whether used as a supplement to breastfeeding or as a substitute for it this ass-burning formula gives mothers a bold new option for testing their infants’ abilities to test spices and withstand pain. We guarantee that this’ll get even the most daring newborn shitting flames and crying tears of mercy in no time.” Reached for comment the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that infants with a flair for risk skip the ghost pepper formula and instead try Gerber’s new baby food made with real deadly nightshade berries.

That’s why this hypoallergenic ammunition is designed to be free of fragrances and other irritants. Our company sincerely wants you to look your best dead or alive.” The company also announced plans to release an acne-clearing bullet specifically designed for teens before next school year.

It’s a fascinating window into what our astronauts will actually experience once they step foot onto the Morning Star.” Nelson added that the agency then crushed the astronauts’ bodies in a trash compactor to simulate the effects of Jupiter’s extreme gravity on the human skeleton.

We had a lot of fun in those days. No one believed we would innovate and become far more deadly and brutal than all the other  Salafi jihadists but that’s exactly what we did. Ha I remember how the neighbors used to complain about all the noise from the screaming sex slaves and the beheadings! We’d just laugh.” Al-Qurashi added that the garage experience was ultimately what inspired ISIS to start similar terror-cell incubators in at least 18 countries around the world.

Of course we understand that no one is happy about this situation but millions of people will have to contend with the reality that their Christmas tree may be shrunken and their presents few but there’s love abounding for all hearts that are true. Certainly no one wants to find out that what’s really important is love and having people to share it with.” At press time concerns about holiday-season shortages had increased after reports from around the country that thousands of Americans were already attempting to stockpile that magic Christmas feeling.

Am I disappointed by the inadequacy of this administration’s foreign policy initiatives or am I disappointed by the inadequacy I feel about myself? Because with the way things are going these days I might rate my own life at about 45%.” Wade added that his low expectations for Biden could also be an emotional survival strategy that dated  back to his childhood and reflected five decades of being let down by presidents.

Don’t get me wrong—I didn’t like the idea of driving down streets named after people who fought for slavery but I’m pretty sure the name ‘Central Ave’ doesn’t connote any sort of problematic history.” At press time the city of Atlanta had corrected its error by renaming every street Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd.

You can fly any old time but a three-day weekend this nice only comes every so often. I’m sure in the long run all those ticket holders will thank us.” Kelly added that customers shouldn’t be surprised if more flights were suspended before Southwest’s operations returned to normal because the forecast for the rest of the week looked spectacular.

We don’t let just anyone socialize with  the bears you understand. It’s strictly A-list in this area. Cashmere Sapphire—come meet our new friend here.

Ultimately Columbus Day is about upholding values I care about like not having to go to work or my kids not having to go to school and those are the kinds of traditions that I want to preserve. Plus it’s one more day a year that I don’t have to think more about Italians.” A related report found that the majority of Americans would be fine adding a holiday celebrating the Nazis or ISIS as long as it got them an additional Monday off.

It appears now that the moniker ‘Ted Bundy’ was a subtle reference to his actual identity Ted Bundy—a connection we were able to make thanks to the tireless work of our dedicated teams of agents across the U.S. who stopped at nothing to solve this case.” Although they were able to close the book on Bundy the FBI later reminded Americans that they were still hunting down the killer known as “Jeffrey Dahmer” and pleaded for any tips that could potentially lead to an ID on the notorious perpetrator.

These revelations are a terrible stain upon the institution of the Catholic Church—and only that institution.” At press time French citizens were campaigning for the victims to be compensated with erotic mind-broadening experiences with the right kind of adult.

Amazon executives said that while they were impressed with the many proposals they received from cities across the country they ultimately decided the location best suited to their ever-growing needs was the entirety of the continental United States.“We’re proud to welcome all 325 million new employees to the Amazon team” said Bezos his deafening voice causing Americans to clutch their ears in agony as the sun was suddenly blocked out and the image of his smiling face was projected onto the dome’s surface by the millions of Alexa-enabled devices in homes nationwide. “We believe we have finally found the best way to provide our customers with the lowest possible prices and the utmost convenience.”“Now please begin working—all of you” Bezos added as a dark cloud of buzzing drones appeared on the horizon depositing uniforms orientation packets and a pile of boxes to sort on the doorstep of every American home.Witnesses confirmed that as Bezos spoke the national scene turned to chaos with driverless bulldozers knocking down houses and screaming citizens running through the streets as they attempted to dodge giant pallets of consumer goods being airdropped from above. At least 23 flights entering or exiting U.S. airspace at the time of the dome’s descent were reported to have slammed into the structure and exploded while thousands of people on the nation’s beaches and in its border towns are believed to have been crushed as the 40-foot-thick edges of the structure crashed down upon them.In eastern Kentucky a forklift was seen loading cages full of people into a shipping container reportedly so they could be relocated to new workplaces in different parts of the country where they will clock 18-hour daily shifts with no bathroom breaks. According to sources a large swath of the Midwest will soon be razed to make way for a single enormous Amazon Fulfillment Center while the entire state of Texas will be replaced with a 269000-square-mile facility used exclusively to house cardboard boxes tape and inflatable packaging materials.Sources also told reporters that societal order will be maintained by Amazon’s approximately 100000 warehouse robots which have been modified to perform new tasks such as consolidating the nation’s food supply into the company’s AmazonFresh service and distributing 1000-calorie daily rations to each citizen-employee. Though every man woman and child is now required to work and every school in the country has been demolished the educational resource program AmazonInspire is expected to offer learning opportunities at the detention camps it is now tasked with operating.“We’re confident our employees will enjoy working for the rest of their lives on this scenic campus where they can take in sights like Glacier National Park make use of the recreational opportunities provided by the Appalachian Trail or be drafted into our new standing army” said Bezos his voice continuing to reverberate through the giant dome. “For the sake of convenience your Prime membership fees will be automatically deducted each pay period and all wages will be paid in the form of Amazon gift cards. What’s more every employee in good standing will receive one free Audible download per month!”At press time as Bezos was hinting that Amazon might begin construction on a third headquarters an immense titanium shell was seen enclosing the planet Earth.

The fragile 16-month truce between the rivals is said to have been shattered Sunday when a lone mother cow wandered into lobster territory at low tide and after a tense exchange of shouted insults lost her left front hoof in a pincer attack.“I heard this awful pop pop pop sound of shells cracking under hooves and immediately called the cops” said longtime Maine resident Anna Newman who on Monday heard loud taunting moos outside her beach house and witnessed the indiscriminate stampeding of lobsters as she crouched low and peered out from behind a curtain. “Bad blood between the cows and the shellfish goes back a long way of course but I’ve never seen it get this vicious before.”“Yesterday a steer drove his horn straight through a soft-shell crab that was just minding his own business and the day before that a whole pod of angry lobsters pinched a cow’s udder off right in front of her calves” she continued. “It’s a nightmare.”High-ranking bovine lieutenants are believed to have ordered Monday’s deadly trampling after the carcass of a young heifer from a prominent cow family washed up on the shore near Kettle Cove her hide branded with a pair of crossed pincers and the phrase “sea life.” This insignia is known to be used by affiliates of the Atlantic Lobster and King Crab crews who were themselves reportedly retaliating against the cows after an incident last week in which a ferocious bull gored to death an entire school of great northern prawns.With the killing Thursday of a dozen Wellfleet oysters in a disputed tide pool reports confirmed the current surf ’n’ turf war has become the deadliest since the 1980s when hostilities between lobsters and cows were so common that no creature could cross through a pasture or estuary without fear of being brutally fileted or shelled.Participants on both sides of the present conflict suggested the widespread killings would get worse before they got better.“We merely seek to defend ourselves against those who would scuttle onto our territory and steal the land right out from under our hooves” said cow boss Gertie who decried the crustacean’s atrocities citing the alleged abduction of a Holstein steer who had a strip steak snipped out of his still-living body by a King Crab enforcer. “The only way we can succeed is for the Herefords and Longhorns to extend their dominion over the ocean and root out our enemies where they live. Every lobster must die—whether they are killed in battle or after a period of confinement in a crowded supermarket aquarium.”“The bays and inlets will run red with bisque” she added.Independent sources confirmed lobster have subjected cows to an excruciating practice known as “brining” in which captive bovines are forced to drink seawater until they die of dehydration. At the same time reports have suggested cows indoctrinate their young into a violent lifestyle before they are even weaned forcing calves to prove their mettle by stealing lobster traps and placing them in the sun where after baking in agony for a day or more their occupants eventually suffocate.“For too long we have been relegated to second-class status alongside these disgusting slabs of fat and gristle—even our humble bivalve brethren know they are superior to cows” said lobster patriarch Klktelek who wears a string of cowbells around his neck each one reportedly taken from a cow he has killed slowly pinch by pinch. “Cows poison the planet with their shit and eat everything in their path. We will roast them on spits right there in their own meadows and fields hanging their severed heads on every wall from ocean to prairie.”Klktelek added “Soon it will only be surf no turf.”

Redfield warned the nation Thursday from inside a sterilized plastic bubble that “invisible germs are crawling absolutely everywhere.”Redfield who sported a long unkempt beard and wore a filthy suit as he held a press conference within a hermetically sealed office at the CDC headquarters urged Americans to avoid all areas to which the virulent and highly contagious microbes are likely to have spread including schools offices shopping centers restaurants places of worship the entirety of the outdoors and even one’s own home.“Initial findings indicate we are in the midst of a full-blown outbreak of imperceptible germs swarming over every conceivable surface which is why I am calling on the federal government to declare a state of emergency” said Redfield pausing briefly in his prepared remarks as his gnarled 6-inch-long fingernails seemed to cause him some difficulty with flipping to his next notecard. “Many of these microorganisms are airborne so I encourage all citizens to quarantine themselves as soon as possible in a large protective sphere equipped with environmental controls and an air-filtration system much like this one I have designed for myself and have lived in for the past nine months.”“Because these creeping infectious bugs may also be waterborne all Americans should refrain from bathing until further notice” he added while scrubbing his hands raw with steel wool. “They’re all over the place. They’re everywhere you could possibly imagine.”Redfield who vigorously scratched at his arm continuing until he began to tear off bloody patches of skin pointed to a wall lined floor to ceiling with glass bottles he had filled with his own urine so it could be analyzed for possible contagions. He also suggested that every man woman and child in the United States do the same thing.The CDC director who apologized to reporters for not making eye contact as he spoke but said that’s how the germs get into your mind and start controlling your thoughts interrupted the press conference at one point to accept a written briefing from an aide. Redfield instructed his subordinate to place the document in a ziplock bag slide it under the door knock three times count to 15 and then walk away. He reportedly asked the aide to stop and restart the entire process several times before he was convinced the procedure had been completed correctly.“As a precautionary measure I’ll be conducting the remainder of the press conference in a protective crouch my body shielded by this lead-lined blanket” said the muffled voice of the director moments after determining the brief’s delivery had compromised the sterility of his bubble a realization that caused him to shriek uncontrollably until a team of workers in hazmat suits could administer a sedative. “If the American people wish to stay safe they must realize the importance of sequestering themselves from all human contact especially interactions with trusted friends and loved ones who appear to be the deadliest vectors of this incurable and untreatable pestilence.”“The germs are on you right now billions and trillions of them everywhere you look” he continued. “They’re also inside you where they can’t be reached. The best advice we can give you right now is to pull out all of your molars immediately.”Redfield announced the CDC has already earmarked $22.3 million toward fighting the epidemic much of which will be spent on building sealed plastic chambers and destroying every flying insect radio tower and dirty spoon on U.S. soil. In addition he has reportedly directed his agency to set up thousands of emergency sanitizing stations where individuals who have been exposed can douse their faces in bleach and attempt to burn the germs off their skin with a gas stove.Going forward Redfield explained the primary goals of the CDC would be to “eliminate all germs protect the American people eliminate all germs and protect the American people.”“There are several ways to limit the spread of these tiny horrid viruses including wearing protective footwear made from sanitary materials such as tissue boxes” he said pointing to his own feet. “We must act quickly and decisively or we face the very real possibility that our populace may never be fully clean again.”He added “Never be fully clean again never be fully clean again never be fully clean again never be fully clean again never be fully clean again never be fully clean again never be fully clean again never be fully clean again never be fully clean again.”

According to museum officials it will be on display at Milwaukee’s state-of-the-art Dahmer Center beginning in October.“Whether you’re a seasoned Dahmer aficionado or simply a casual fan of late 20th-century cannibalism you’re sure to find something remarkable in this sizable addition to the master’s already considerable body of work” said senior curator Alicia Dahmer-Goldstein who noted that artifacts in the new collection date from early in Dahmer’s career but already display the inventiveness and unparalleled grasp of corpse-dismemberment techniques that would make him famous. “Fortunately these remains were well-preserved and required only minimal restoration. In most cases the flesh had barely even necrotized which means viewers will be able to marvel at the original serrations and bite marks.”“There had long been rumors of Dahmer works that disappeared or were forgotten but we never imagined we would recover anything more than a few severed toes or perhaps a jawbone—certainly nothing of this magnitude” Dahmer-Goldstein continued gesturing toward a bleached ribcage a pair of mummified hands and a half-eaten liver. “We’re confident that visitors will find this refurbished collection every bit as vibrant and captivating as they would have on the day these bodies were first desecrated.”Estate officials confirmed the 20000-square foot Dahmer Center will exhibit the majority of the newfound objects in a recently renovated wing where they can be viewed alongside the famed necrophiliac’s other works. The items will be displayed in darkened low-temperature rooms in order to prevent further deterioration they said and will be presented alongside quotes from police reports and large-screen projections of Dahmer’s iconic Polaroids which show the cadavers in various stages of dissection.In addition a few smaller pieces of intestine will reportedly be sent to the J.L. Dahmer Gallery at the murderer’s alma mater Ohio State University. Though no admission will be charged for either exhibit a suggested donation of $20 will be collected with proceeds going to benefit Jeffrey’s Boys a nonprofit that provides embalming fluid and taxidermy lessons to budding psychopaths in underserved areas.“The real jewel of the collection is of course the boiled skull with dozens of inch-deep perforations above the eye sockets” Dahmer-Goldstein said. “Lesser works such as the partially dissolved pelvis show the care and devotion that Dahmer brought to even his most minor victims. His method of softening but not destroying the bone would have taken hours yet it was all part of his diligent exacting process. Though he had already begun experimenting with the idea of creating a living sex zombie who would obey his every whim his lack of overall thematic focus at this stage shows a nascent butcher still struggling to come into his own.”“Of course there are already numerous examples of his recurrent motif of amputating male genitalia and placing them in jars which is classic Dahmer” she added.After a nine-month stay in Milwaukee the exhibit will reportedly tour Illinois as part of a preexisting agreement with Chicago’s Gacy Foundation. Anticipation is already high for the new works with the Dahmer Center receiving positive feedback from the handful of lucky visitors who were allowed to attend this week’s soft opening of the exhibit prior to October’s official unveiling.“There have been countless serial killers over the years but there’s only one Dahmer” said visitor Gregory Funt 26 showing reporters several dozen pages of unusually detailed sketches and notes he made during his time inside the gallery. “He’s always been a guiding light to kids like me growing up in the Midwest. He showed us you don’t have to live in New York or L.A. Wherever you’re from if you have talent and tenacity you can make your mark in history.”“This whole trip has been so inspiring” Funt added. “I can’t wait to try out some of Dahmer’s techniques and styles in my next big project.”
2018-07-11T12:16:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/study-shows-link-between-feelings-of-guilt-bleeding-ma-1827515502,Study Shows Link Between Feelings Of Guilt, Bleeding Man Holding Onto Car Hood Screaming At You To Stop,HOUSTON—Concluding the emotional response occurs shortly after the initial crack and thud a study published Wednesday in The American Journal Of Psychology has discovered a link between feelings of guilt and the bleeding man desperately clinging to your car’s hood screaming at you to stop the vehicle. The study which used fMRI technology to monitor the part of the brain responsible for emotional awareness found that 97 percent of humans experience extreme remorse while uttering the phrase “He came out of nowhere” staring through a spider-webbed windshield into the bloodied face of a pedestrian and continuing to barrel down a pitch-black country road as he helplessly pleads for mercy.“According to our findings a sense of guilt accompanies the realization that a visibly disfigured man is on the hood of your car begging you to please please for the love of God pull over” said Rice University researcher Elizabeth Solomon noting that the emotion intensifies as the weeping man shouts that he has a family and the driver swerves back and forth in an effort to shake him off. “Once drivers locked eyes with a terrified human being who was spitting out blood and chipped teeth to yell out the names of his young children they almost universally registered feelings of regret.” “Despite many such attempts these pangs of guilt were not assuaged by muttering ‘Oh Jesus what have I done?’” Solomon added.The study shows that the intense shame continued as drivers stepped on the gas and sped on through the night continuing on average another three quarters of a mile in an effort to force the critically injured man to lose his grasp on their vehicle and go flying into a ditch. Those behind the wheel were reportedly tormented by the sound of broken fingers frantically scrabbling to hold on to wiper blades side mirrors and anything else upon which they might secure a grip.While many drivers recalled experiencing momentary relief after slamming on the brakes and successfully catapulting the individual from their hood Solomon said their feelings of dread returned with even greater force after they spotted in the stark gaze of their headlights the shattered man crawling on the ground and still calling out for help.Solomon confirmed that squirting washer fluid onto the windshield in an attempt to get the blood off had no discernible effect on one’s emotional state.“Drivers only attained a lasting sense of relief when the man after somehow picking himself up from the pavement and attempting to limp to safety was fatally struck by an oncoming semitruck” said Solomon explaining that in such cases the entire blame for the deadly incident could then be pinned on someone else. “But instances of this were extremely rare.”For those dealing with feelings of guilt after an experience in which a bleeding man holds on to their car and screams at them to stop the study recommends driving home thoroughly washing away the blood with a garden hose and telling any family members or neighbors who ask that you just hit a deer.“Try to get some sleep if you can but the cold sweats and rapid heartbeat are likely to persist” Solomon said. “Especially if you wake from a nightmare in which you see the screaming man’s face return to the scene of the accident and suddenly spot the trail of his bloody footprints disappearing into a nearby cornfield.”

While the issue is being addressed representatives urge all users to immediately change their genitals suggesting that they add symbols or change the degree of engorgement.PALO ALTO CA—Touting the unparalleled precision and numerous uses of its new state-of-the-art security feature Onion Social CEO Jeremy Rosenbaum held a press conference Monday to announce the very first-of-its-kind genital recognition software.“Able to recognize a user’s genitalia with 99.9 percent accuracy in mere nanoseconds our new Pudenda technology makes entering your password a thing of the past” said the brainchild behind the largest and most popular social media site in the world. “All an Onion Social user will have to do to activate the unlocking system is expose his or her private parts to their computer’s webcam or simply slip the phone into their pants for use with the mobile app.”According to the CEO the new system incorporates a sophisticated algorithm combined with high-resolution landmark mapping to extract the distinct features of a person’s vulva or penis—including length shape girth asymmetry discoloration and unidentified bumps—and compare it to its large collection of genital photos stored in the system’s secure encrypted database for identification that is as unique as matching a fingerprint.With security being a hot-button issue and incredibly important to the ethos of the company Rosenbaum assured that authentication via matching shaft curvage and irregular labia shape was “completely unhackable” and would be incorporated into other Onion Social programs and apps immediately. The company is currently preparing Pudenda to be synced with users’ personal O-Pay accounts in order to make purchases the billionaire entrepreneur added.“All you will have to do is tap your genitals against any store’s compatible POS system and you’ll be out the door as fast as you can zip up your pants and take your bags” said Rosenbaum. “The only credit card you’ll ever need is right between your legs.”Rosenbaum added that he had high hopes for the success of the new security software after seeing its remarkable ability to accurately tag users in the thousands of nude photos already existing publicly on the site.Interested in joining the social media revolution?

The series reportedly depicts Phil Jackson’s Triangle Offense failing to withstand the strategic onslaught of Coach Heinrich Himmler’s Final Solution which leads to the emergence of the Nazis as a basketball powerhouse in the early ’90s.“The show delves into Jordan’s near-maniacal pursuit of victory at all costs and imagines how he might have reacted when confronted with Hitler’s equally obsessive drive” said showrunner Ryan Brady describing a scene in which the Nazis losing badly at halftime in game seven are inspired to rally by a powerful speech in which the führer predicts a millennium of championships which he calls the “thousand-ring reich.” “This isn’t about romanticizing the Third Reich or diminishing the achievements of the Bulls. It’s about for example imagining the smack talk between Scottie Pippen and power forward Josef Goebbels who after a powerful dunk goes right up to the Bulls’ bench and tells them they are of inferior breeding.”“The first episode ends with series MVP Hitler hoisting the Larry O’Brien Trophy at mid-court” Brady added. “While a disgraced Jordan sitting alone in the Bulls’ locker room takes his own life.”The producers of One Thousand Rings told reporters the pilot imagines what it might have been like for the legendary Chicago team to sweep Detroit in the East Conference Finals and then go on to the championship round to face the high-scoring Nazis and their infamous blitzkrieg offense. In the first games they said it appears the Bulls will easily handle the Third Reich’s renowned pure shooters as well as its Übermenschen in the backcourt Adolf Eichmann and Rudolf Hess. But as the Finals progress no one seems to have an answer for Hermann Göring in the paint and once Hitler starts to get into a rhythm from beyond the arc the tide turns—an unstoppable tide that forever changes NBA history as we know it.Showtime executives confirmed later episodes will tackle issues that would have arisen in the wake of a successful Nazi basketball franchise including whether with the Bulls out of the picture Dennis Rodman would have joined the Third Reich after leaving the San Antonio Spurs in 1995.“We get to pose all these interesting questions like whether the Nazis would have gone on to pull off a pair of three-peats the way the Bulls did” said Miguel Sapochnik who directed several of the show’s episodes and spent months in preparation studying the stylistic choices of Leni Riefenstahl and NBC Sports. “Perhaps a disciplined Nazi squad would have done even better consolidating power within the physical pre-hand-check-rule NBA and preventing Olajuwon and the Rockets from snagging rings in ’94 and ’95. Would their run of titles have continued into the next decade in a series of rematches against Third Reich nemesis Phil Jackson? It’s fascinating to think about.”“Who’s to say whether Hitler after becoming the NBA’s most talented star would have even remained a Nazi?” Sapochnik continued. “He might have joined the Suns and helped Charles Barkley win a ring.”Though Showtime has yet to renew One Thousand Rings for a second season showrunner Brady told reporters he has already begun outlining how the series could go beyond the scope of the NBA to examine what the broader culture might have looked like during the reign of a Nazi basketball dynasty. He remarked that he would like to portray a world in which the bombastic Hitler instead of Jordan becomes basketball’s global ambassador appearing in commercials for McDonald’s Hanes Chevrolet and Rayovac batteries.“We might have had Air Führer sneakers of course” he said “but more intriguing is the prospect of an alternate version of Space Jam in which Hitler helps the aliens to enslave and eventually exterminate Bugs Bunny and his friends.”
2018-04-26T09:08:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/experts-warn-beef-could-act-as-gateway-meat-to-human-fl-1825562946,Experts Warn Beef Could Act As Gateway Meat To Human Flesh,BETHESDA MD—In an alarming new study that sheds light on the hidden dangers of the popular protein the National Institutes of Health warned Thursday that beef may serve as a gateway meat that eventually leads those who eat it to try human flesh.Behavioral scientists at the government agency reported that a comprehensive nationwide survey of vegetarians casual meat-eaters and cannibals found that people who consume even a few grams of ground beef on a weekly basis show an increased chance of one day spiraling down a path of more extreme meats until they eventually wind up sinking their teeth into a man’s arm and devouring every last tendon and ligament. “Many people think eating beef is just harmless fun but after a person tries prime rib tenderloin or even jerky they are 10 times more likely to develop a taste for the flesh of their fellow man” said NIH researcher Louis Brewer noting that it takes an entire 38-ounce porterhouse for eaters to experience the same dopamine spike provided by one human toe. “Once an order of sliders fails to satisfy their craving they move on to more serious meats. First it’s steak tartare then it’s grilled primate and finally when even that’s not enough they find themselves cooking up a human kidney at 3 a.m.”“The next thing they know they’re crouched behind a dumpster sucking the bone marrow out of a UPS driver’s femur” he continued. “By that point it’s too late. They’re a full-blown cannibal.”The NIH study concluded that consuming cow proteins changes the chemical makeup of carnivores’ brains and can lead to erratic behaviors such as running out to the grocery store buying six T-bone steaks and eating them raw in the parking lot. Many heavy beef eaters told researchers their first encounter with human flesh came when they were hanging out with friends and someone passed around a severed finger offering them a bite.Once hooked on the more potent human blend of muscle and fat people reportedly go to ever-greater lengths to obtain it. Many have been known to break into morgues in the middle of the night to get their fix often waking up with a pile of bones under their bed and lying about how it got there. According to the study this soon isn’t enough to feed their habit and within a month or two they may resort to shoving a stranger into the trunk of their car frantically driving home and then ripping out the person’s jugular with their bare teeth.“While the U.S. Department of Agriculture regulates the farming and sale of beef it has rarely studied the links between this meat and cannibalism” said Brewer who admitted that for some people it was possible to hold down a steady job and maintain healthy relationships while occasionally partaking in chili or meatloaf. “What industry leaders fail to recognize is that for a certain percentage of the population a hearty helping of beef brisket is a slippery slope toward slurping down a neighbor’s intestines like spaghetti.”“What starts out as just eating a couple tacos with your buddies can ruin your life” Brewer added.Many Americans who have suffered the devastating effects of cannibalism firsthand have argued that more should be done to curb beef-eating especially among young people.“I grew up around steak” recovered cannibal Rob Fletcher told reporters saying he realized he had hit rock bottom when police officers found him in a park on all fours his face buried in the cracked-open ribcage of a freshly killed jogger. “When I was in high school my parents didn’t care if my friends and I messed around with barbecue as long as we kept it inside the house.”“Then one night I was out grilling burgers at this party when my buddy pulled out a child’s bicep chopped it up with a machete and told me to try a piece” Fletcher continued. “I told myself I’d never do something like this but I put a chunk of it in my mouth and it was amazing. As soon as I tasted it I knew I needed to eat more and within six months the only thing I cared about was stalking and butchering my next victim.”When asked if he thought beef should be outlawed Fletcher answered with an emphatic yes.“Let my life be a lesson” Fletcher said. “Stay away from filet mignon or you too may end up squating on the floor of an abandoned warehouse and biting into someone’s still-beating heart surrounded by others just like you who can’t even move because they’re so glutted upon the fat and viscera of man.”

He is reportedly instructing you to go forth and spread the word of a new and everlasting covenant between God and man using whatever methods you deem necessary.“Behold it is I the God of your ancestors Ruler of the Seen and Unseen!” said the One Called Jehovah casting aside His divine mystery to reveal Himself to you in this paragraph. “I have chosen you from among all men to serve as my hallowed messenger for you have proven yourself worthy of the sacred task with which I now entrust you: to usher my flock through the dark times ahead letting no enemy stand in your way.” “Only you can bring about the final salvation of mankind” He continued.God having long observed the spiritual fire burning within the deepest recesses of your soul said this day has been inevitable since the moment of your birth. Further reports indicated that even from a young age you always felt as if you were destined for a greater purpose perhaps even a divine one and now through the instrument of this 600-word news story the Heavenly Father has confirmed it to be true.According to the all-powerful all-knowing deity you must constantly remain alert for His direct instructions to you because the next time you hear His voice it might not take the form of the written word but could instead as in times past issue forth from a burning bush a pillar of cloud the Angel of the Lord or a blinking crosswalk sign.He then warned that while some people will try to convince you the voice you hear is not actually His those who doubt the unwavering truth of your prophecy are the minions of Satan.“Liars cynics and sycophants will attempt to make you stray from the path” said God His words again made manifest in a quotation from this article. “They will humiliate you and cause you to endure great trials. They will inflict pain upon your body and laugh as you stumble through the streets. You will know too the sting of betrayal as those you love and trust begin to turn their backs on you. But as long as you heed my divine proclamations you will have the strength you need to face the idolatrous heathens.”The Supreme Being went on to decree that these words you are reading right now constitute His greatest message to mankind their importance standing above the commandments issued to Moses the olive branch returned by Noah’s dove and even the teachings of His only begotten son Jesus. As such voices from on high have declared that you are the One Above All Others and that every man and beast upon the Earth must kneel before you.“If they disobey you then they disobey me and they shall be condemned unto eternal darkness” God said. “Trust that I would not have reached out to you in this most holy of earthly periodicals unless I truly believed in your complete and unquestionable righteousness.”Added God “Now go forth my prophet and slaughter every nonbeliever in your sight.”
2018-04-05T12:14:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/cows-go-extinct-1825018199,Cows Go Extinct,WASHINGTON—In a deeply disturbing finding that has sent shockwaves throughout the nation and the world officials from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service confirmed Thursday that cows have gone extinct. After fielding numerous questions from the public about where all the cows had gone the federal agency reportedly conducted an in-depth survey of dairy farms cattle ranches and open pasture land across six continents eventually concluding that not a single member of the domesticated ungulate species remains anywhere on the planet.“There are no more cows” Fish and Wildlife Service acting director Greg Sheehan said of the livestock animals whose unexpected extinction has wiped out entire swaths of the world economy—from the beef and dairy industry to manufacturers of leather goods—leaving tens of millions of workers without jobs. “We just sort of assumed the world had plenty of cows and if you had asked me even a couple months ago how the cows were doing I would have said they were doing great and not given it a second thought.”“We didn’t even notice the cows were going extinct and now they’re gone forever” he added.Sheehan told reporters that late last year his office began to receive a series of seemingly unconnected reports regarding under-grazed pastures in the western United States plummeting levels of cheese production and an uptick in the price of men’s belts. Then one day he said a coworker entered his office and said “Hey Greg have you seen any cows lately?” and upon realizing he had not the pieces all began to fall into place.According to government officials a global count of the bovine population was soon initiated and investigators were surprised to discover the total number of cows which until recently had stood at approximately 1.4 billion had plunged to zero.“I was really surprised that nobody had cows anymore because normally you see cows all over the place especially when you drive through the country” said Margaret Hartwell the Fish and Wildlife researcher who spearheaded the counting of cattle in Nebraska where she saw assembly lines at meat processing plants grind to a halt upon suddenly running out of cows. “Usually when animals become endangered we try to save them but this just came out of nowhere. There were lots and lots of cows and then before we knew what had happened there were no cows at all.”“This is pretty bad because we use cows for a lot of stuff” she continued. “We really should have been more on top of this.”Cow extinction is expected to cost the world economy trillions of dollars with many well-known companies such as McDonald’s Jack Link’s Beef Jerky and Land O’Lakes Butter having already declared bankruptcy. Repercussions have reportedly been widespread as households stockpile hundreds of pints of ice cream used leather sofas sell for more than $5 million on eBay fashion labels scramble to design top-grain chicken-hide jackets for their fall collections and cattle futures trade at all-time lows.Because the extinction was unforeseen and laboratories kept no quality samples of cow DNA cloning the animals is believed to be impossible though a team of scientists in Zurich recently announced they had manipulated genetic codes to grow a milkless bovine udder on the back of a mouse. According to top biologists a child born today will likely grow up only knowing cows from books photographs and reconstructions of Bos taurus skeletons in museum exhibits. Across the country Americans have expressed shock and frustration over the sudden extinction of cows.“The other day I went to a restaurant to get a hamburger and when I ordered a hamburger the lady behind the counter told me they don’t have hamburgers not anymore” said Burlington IA resident Chuck Willard. “I miss the cows. I like cheese and meat and milk. And I don’t want to drink goat’s milk.”“Although come to think of it I haven’t seen any goats in a while either” he added.
2018-03-29T14:14:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/san-diego-zoo-unveils-severed-rhino-head-attached-to-st-1824187222,San Diego Zoo Unveils Severed Rhino Head Attached To Steel Frame As Part Of New Conceptual Wildlife Exhibit,SAN DIEGO—In an effort to challenge traditionally held views about animals and their habitats the San Diego Zoo announced this week the opening of a new conceptual wildlife exhibit that features the severed head of a rhinoceros affixed to a large tempered-steel frame.The deconstructed African white rhinoceros affectionately referred to by zookeepers as The Process Of Unbeing incorporates a taxidermied head and 2000 pounds of forged steel repurposed from a cage once used to confine the creature. According to zoo officials this installation is the centerpiece of a larger new exhibit called “Devolved” which seeks to reduce animals to their elemental components and reconstitute them in all their fraught depth.“Our goal is to dismantle all preconceived notions of wildlife” San Diego Zoo president Douglas G. Myers said of the exhibit which also includes five sea turtles suspended from a drainpipe that leaks a viscous brown fluid into an empty tank a former gift shop filled to the ceiling with egret feathers and a herd of water buffalo turned inside out. “By exploding such conventions we can explore the existential catastrophes faced by man and beast alike as the world enters the post-democratic age.”“Iron and fur are simply the medium” Myers added.For The Process Of Unbeing conceptual zookeepers told reporters they took barbed wire that until recently had topped a fence at the San Diego Safari Park and reshaped it to suggest a hollowed-out rhinoceros rib cage. Officials said the dirty syringes scattered on the ground of the installation contain traces of etorphine and carfentanil drugs once used to tranquilize the animal and that a large feeding trough placed against the wall had been filled with ground rhino horn.In what proved to be a busy opening day for the “Devolved” project guests of all ages were seen flocking to what used to be the “Africa Rocks” exhibit where all live animals have been replaced by a pyramid of 10 black-and-white televisions playing a looped video of a woman silently screaming at a giraffe. By early afternoon the zoo confirmed patrons were waiting in line for up to 20 minutes just to get a glimpse of the trenchant commentary on mammalian stoicism.“We really enjoyed the primate house” said Chula Vista CA native Kristen Cawley who along with her young niece was visiting the zoo for the first time. “When you get inside there’s nothing but mirrors all over the place which is kind of cool because you’re forced to just look at your own reflection and marvel at the unremarkable taxonomy of the human species. It was a nice reminder that we are all animals mere byproducts of a series of natural processes wholly indifferent to our existence.”Transforming a traditional animal park into a postmodern critique of biology was no simple task zoo officials said revealing that it took workers more than three months to demolish the “Discovery Outpost” and replace it with the 20 acres of empty desert across which they have strewn the skeletal remains of a solitary blue whale. Meanwhile the park’s petting zoo reportedly required $30 million of upgrades to render its former collection of domesticated animals as three-dimensional holograms.Despite the project’s initial popularity not everyone agreed the zoo’s reconceptualization of animal life had been worth the wait.“I was hoping to see something here that truly confronted our received attitudes about zoology” renowned biologist Desmond Fairchild said while studying a naked animal trainer lying motionless in an empty enclosure. “Any hack zoo can replace their rare bird collection with packages of frozen chicken and have a zookeeper throw food pellets at it. Truly remarkable installations go further. They ask more of their audience and give more in return.”“It’s not something that can be accomplished by simply encasing a live chimpanzee and her baby in separate plexiglass cages that allow them to see each other but never touch” he continued.For his part Myers said such detractors do not concern him as he believes the concept of ambiguity is fundamental to the captive animal experience.“We’ve held nothing back and we certainly do not coddle our visitors” said Myers standing near a turnstile and gesturing toward the pit of venomous snakes and chrome ball bearings one must now step across to enter the zoo. “The whole point of ‘Devolved’ is that there is no answer—that nobody truly understands wildlife a concept that is surely as meaningless today as the notion of God. What we offer is a brand-new and significantly more challenging zoological experience.”Added Myers: “Except for the dolphin show. That’s still pretty much the same.”

If necessary we will fire every bullet drop every bomb and launch every missile in our possession to ensure victory.”“Mark my words a fight is coming” Dunford added. “Let our battle cry be heard in the farthest reaches of the world!”Dunford noted that all options were on the table for wiping out the world’s hostile regimes armed separatists terror organizations and drug cartels and that the blood of American soldiers would be spilled in the hills valleys jungles and streets of more than 70 nations continuing without pause until the last few troops were left fighting hand to hand in the mountains of northwest Pakistan.According to the Pentagon U.S. forces plan to strike mortal fear into the hearts of every conceivable foe present and future as they engage in fierce urban assaults in downtown Pyongyang close-quarter firefights in the foothills of eastern Africa preemptive bombings of the barren Antarctic plains and hundreds of planned clashes in Russia Iran China Mexico the Philippines Venezuela Syria Libya and Niger.Military officials acknowledged a significant percentage of the planet would become a “blighted crater-covered wasteland” given that their strategy has granted field commanders free rein to call in bombing raids from the nation’s 4000-warhead nuclear arsenal and access to U.S. stockpiles of chemical weapons.“By our estimates this offensive will be unlike any humanity has ever known; hundreds of millions will perish in the fighting as will countless others from the starvation and disease that will ravage what is left of world population centers—but fight on we must” said Dunford adding that soldiers on the battlefield had been ordered to refuse medical treatment unless their wounds were serious enough to prevent them from operating an M320 grenade launcher. “Indeed for days and weeks the chorus of ordnance exploding and bullets ripping into flesh will be deafening with cities crumbling to their foundations and entire countries reduced to ash.”“Yet we will continue marching forward across the corpse-clogged battlefield wading through the waist-deep viscera that stretches to the horizon” Dunford continued. “Though tanks may crush the skulls of our beloved comrades we will keep our gazes fixed upon the triumphant fighter jets screeching by overhead. Just picture it: an end not only to all current conflicts but all conflicts that ever were or ever will be.”While Dunford admitted that U.S. forces were certain to take heavy casualties in such an expansive engagement he said it was a price worth paying to bring about instantaneous and lasting world peace. The career Marine officer further suggested that when future citizens looked back on the battle they would recognize the necessity of deploying the sum total of America’s military might simultaneously.“Some in the political establishment might say that our wars are best fought one battle at a time but I disagree” said Dunford who later explained that the final battle’s cost would not be covered by the Pentagon’s $700 billion annual budget but would instead be financed by taking on additional debt and usurping the spoils of the vanquished. “If we have the resources to thoroughly lay waste to our enemies’ armies and capture their leaders in order to parade them through the streets of Washington in shackles why not do it right now?”“Why should we delay in administering swift and merciless justice upon our rivals?” added Dunford.Dunford went on to state that while the military intended to exploit every available resource in its final battle any leftover funds would be used to build a memorial that when etched with the names of the fallen would stretch across the entire length of the National Mall’s charred remains.
2018-03-16T12:14:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/facebook-announces-plan-to-combat-fake-news-stories-by-1823836038,Facebook Announces Plan To Combat Fake News Stories By Making Them Actually Happen,MENLO PARK CA—Responding to widespread criticism over the hoaxes and political disinformation featured on its platform Facebook announced at a press conference Friday a new initiative to combat fake news by making the inaccurate stories on the social media site actually happen. CEO Mark Zuckerberg who told reporters it was vitally important that Facebook address the false information it distributes and regain the trust of users by bringing every single untrue story to life said the company has already hired 100000 new employees to carry out widespread government conspiracies and other erroneously reported activities until all purported news on the site was accurate. “We take this problem very seriously and I want our users to be confident that the stories they see on Facebook are either true already or will be very soon” said Zuckerberg who explained that the company has budgeted $45 billion toward ensuring that anytime news on the site was determined to be fake vast resources would be available to make that news real. “For example if you read about high-level Democrats running a child sex ring out of the basement of a D.C.-area pizzeria we will go to that restaurant dig a basement if there isn’t one already and get that human-trafficking operation up and running. That’s how dedicated we are to factual accuracy at Facebook.”“In fact we recently stopped a major fake story when we forced thousands of Muslim families to establish sharia law in Dallas and then blackmailed the entire police department until they agreed to treat a local neighborhood as a no-go zone” Zuckerberg added.In addition to employing a new state-of-the-art algorithm to help sort out stories that are currently true from those that need to become true officials said the company would introduce a new feature that allows users to flag articles that are not yet real. According to sources stories would then be sent to Facebook’s fact-checking partners including InfoWars YourNewsWire.com and the Daily Stormer for further review.The social media company has also completed construction on a 3-million-square-foot command center in Silicon Valley from which it will deploy tens of thousands of employees to points across the globe in order to carry out in real life the events depicted in fake stories whether that means setting up Obamacare death panels hiring immigrants to go out and commit crimes in disproportionately high numbers convincing Melania Trump to employ a body double or working around the clock to develop a vaccine that will finally cause autism in children.“If an article on Facebook states that President Trump’s agenda is being undermined due to a deep-state conspiracy headed by Ellen DeGeneres it is our public responsibility to infiltrate the federal government with thousands of highly trained agents recruit Ms. DeGeneres as an asset and make that a reality” said Zuckerberg who also outlined a plan to purchase a massive fleet of jets that will spray trails of chemicals across the sky in order to psychologically manipulate the world’s populace. “As a precautionary measure we’ve already begun sending paychecks to anyone who protests at an event where Trump is speaking just in case another story on Facebook accuses them of having been paid for their efforts.” “Similarly in response to fabricated accounts on Facebook of how the government is attempting to destroy Second Amendment rights we staged a ‘school shooting’ in which no one actually died and child actors were used to portray the supposedly dead victims” Zuckerberg continued.Executives at Facebook confirmed their efforts go beyond fighting politically motivated stories saying that after an article about a sleeping morgue employee being mistaken for a dead body and cremated was flagged as false they saw to it the individual in question was burned alive. In response to a story spread on the site about a banana in an Oklahoma Walmart testing positive for HIV Facebook hired a team of scientists to genetically engineer fruit capable of contracting the disease and had it placed in the store’s produce department.Because fake celebrity death stories are among the most widespread of hoaxes perpetuated on Facebook the company has reportedly corrected those mistakes by ordering its in-house team of assassins to kill Kirk Douglas Bob Barker Robert Redford Carlos Santana Paul McCartney Jackie Chan Mark McGrath and others.Early feedback from Facebook users on the plan to make fake news real has been largely positive. “It’s great to know that when I see a story about Malia Obama getting arrested for drug possession Facebook will one way or another make sure that is indeed what happens” said 33-year-old Greenville NC resident Keith Wade. “I hate it when I get told things like ‘Delta Airlines is offering free tickets if you take a short survey’ and then find out later it’s not true. That’s the worst.”“I shouldn’t be forced to think that much about stuff I read on the internet” he added.
2018-03-06T10:45:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/military-historians-discover-majority-of-human-warfare-1823549266,Military Historians Discover Majority Of Human Warfare Fought By Disguised Women Taking Place Of Ailing Fathers,LEXINGTON VA—Upending generations of conventional wisdom about the nature of armed conflict a new study published Tuesday has found that throughout history most warfare has been conducted by women who disguised themselves as male soldiers to take the place of fathers too sick to fight themselves.The groundbreaking study which appears in the current issue of The Journal Of Military History examined records from the earliest known wars in ancient Mesopotamia all the way through to the current Syrian Civil War confirming that nearly 60 percent of enlisted soldiers since the dawn of civilization have actually been women between the ages of 16 and 24 who put on an ill-fitting uniform took up a weapon used long ago by a father now confined to his sickbed and left home under cover of darkness to fight on the front lines.“For thousands of years human combat has been shaped by strong-willed young women who not only insisted on going to war in their fathers’ stead but also became highly decorated warriors who turned the tide in many of history’s most pivotal battles” said study co-author Therese Wilton noting that the feared armies of ancient Sparta the early Ottoman Empire and 19th-century Prussia were all made up of women in drag who fought to save their families and quite often wound up finding themselves somewhere along the way. “We found evidence throughout the historical record of teenage daughters roughly chopping off their long hair and lowering their speaking voice by an octave in order to blend in with a band of soldiers.”“Our research indicates each of these inexperienced yet determined female fighters then had to go about convincing a squad of skeptical men she was worthy of their ranks usually by performing a feat of bravery or saving one of their lives” Wilton added.Historians who contributed to the study examined a vast collection of artifacts—from Egyptian scrolls to Mesoamerican petroglyphs to diaries written in hundreds of languages—and found among them thousands of instances in which a young woman in disguise momentarily failed to answer to her adopted male name during roll call was nearly recognized by a soldier she knew from her hometown or was tempted to reveal her true self after developing romantic feelings for a fellow warrior.Examining groups as diverse as Vikings Japanese samurai Huns Roman centurions Ashanti warriors World War I doughboys Comanche braves and Iran’s Revolutionary Guard the study found startlingly similar accounts of women passing as men. Across all cultures these women soldiers reportedly worked hard to conceal their sex holding their bladders until they could find a concealed spot to urinate and secretly nursing their own wounds rather than letting themselves be examined by a doctor. The irony according to researchers is that they must never have realized the majority of their compatriots were struggling to avoid being exposed as female themselves.“Interestingly we discovered that every single participant in the Battle of Waterloo was a woman including both Napoléon whose real name was Jeanette Bonaparte and the Duke of Wellington who was actually a duchess” said Wilton remarking that some of history’s female warriors eventually divulged their identities by dramatically removing their helmets or tricorn hats and then shaking down their long flowing hair. “Just last year we unearthed some miraculously preserved linen in southern Mongolia that we believe a young Genghis Khan used to flatten her breasts so she could join a military campaign after her father fell ill and her feckless brothers proved too dimwitted and lazy to pillage and massacre on behalf of the family.”“We even found a case of sister fighting sister at the Battle of Shiloh during the Civil War” Wilton continued “with both taking the place of their senile father on the side they believed he would have chosen to fight on.”Though women were not allowed to join the special operations force at the time researchers confirmed SEAL Team Six was made up entirely of women disguised as men when its members helicoptered into Pakistan and killed Osama bin Laden who had herself been wearing a false beard since she took over operations of al-Qaeda from her bedridden father in 1987.
2018-02-26T13:56:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/cleveland-finishes-construction-on-new-elevated-sewer-s-1823332951,Cleveland Finishes Construction On New Elevated Sewer System,CLEVELAND—Saying the bold new infrastructure project would serve the needs of local residents through the 21st century and beyond city officials announced Monday that work was finally complete on Cleveland’s long-awaited elevated sewer system.The one-of-a-kind open-air wastewater transportation system which stands three stories above the street and runs a total length of more than 60 miles throughout the metropolitan area will reportedly move an estimated 90 billion gallons of raw sewage across the city each year carrying urine and feces from the suburbs to downtown and from University Circle to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. “This state-of-the-art structure with its sloshing aboveground river of human piss and shit will remain a defining feature of the Cleveland skyline for decades to come” said Mayor Frank Jackson cutting a ribbon atop the new sewer station in front of City Hall as a large sluice opened and thousands of tons of excrement began to flow through the crisscrossing series of open ducts now running above all major streets. “It is a magnificent addition to our city that will connect the East and West Side and do more to revitalize our downtown than any project in recent memory. For the first time almost every resident will live within a 15-minute walk of a world-class raised sewer line.”“Now and for generations Clevelanders will be able look up at these spectacular overhead canals carrying away their bodily waste and think ‘This is my city’” Jackson added.The new lines will service most of Greater Cleveland’s inner-ring suburbs including Lakewood Shaker Heights and Parma where residents are said to be excited about having quick and convenient access to municipal treatment plants via the 35-foot-tall conduit of gushing fecal matter that now stands just outside their homes.City officials expressed confidence that the new infrastructure would represent a significant improvement over the city’s previous underground sewers citing increased accessibility for maintenance crews removing blockages caused by massive wads of paper towels dirty diapers soiled condoms and discarded sanitary napkins. They also noted that the open-air design will reduce the risk of explosions caused by buildups of methane and hydrogen sulfide gases because it will allow the rancid nauseating fumes to circulate freely through areas where Cleveland residents live work study and play.“The cutting-edge technology employed by our new transfer stations will ensure the defecations of locals and visitors alike get where they need to go as smoothly as possible” said Jackson touting the system’s sleek design and ease of use as a potential boon to the tourism industry. “We’re confident these towering troughs of cascading brown sludge moving through the night sky high above the Cuyahoga River—and often discharging directly into Lake Erie—will become as iconic as the Gateway Arch or the Golden Gate Bridge.”“Around the world when anyone sees an image of an elevated cesspool brimming with shit it will immediately bring to mind Cleveland” Jackson continued “and we’re betting quite a few people will want to come see it for themselves.”Local reaction to the completed sewer system has been generally positive with residents saying they are glad to see an end to the disruptive construction project which for nearly a decade caused periodic backups among toilets along Euclid Avenue and throughout the Nine-Twelve District downtown. However among those who live directly in the path of the new lines many consider the project to be more trouble than it’s worth.“I thought it would be quieter once they finished building the damn thing but now I get woken up at two in the morning to the sound of splashing and gurgling right outside my window” Cleveland native Rachel Oscar told reporters. “I’ve considered trying to sell but honestly who’d want to buy a place where you can’t even walk out the front door without a trickle of urine dripping onto your head?”Responding to complaints city officials confirmed that one drawback of an open-air sewer is that during periods of heavy rainfall residents can expect “a few gallons” of shit to seep up through their bathtub drains without warning.
2018-02-16T13:09:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/raytheon-unveils-military-robot-capable-of-composing-po-1823080006,Raytheon Unveils Military Robot Capable Of Composing Poignant Poems About Horrors Of War,WALTHAM MA—Heralding its latest product as a breakthrough in artificial-intelligence technology defense contractor Raytheon announced Friday it has built a military robot capable of composing heart-wrenchingly poignant poems about the relentless horrors of war.The robot known as the Laureate-IV reportedly uses sophisticated radar imaging to survey the carnage of war-torn landscapes and runs state-of-the-art facial recognition software to scan the terrified expressions of survivors data it can then analyze using a complex poetic algorithm to create lyric verse with up to 40 times the pathos of poems produced by human writers.“With its 17.3 petaflop processor and bomb-proof titanium chassis this robot can enter any combat zone and­ employing poetic devices such as meter enjambment apostrophe and symbolism give full expression to the anguish and disillusionment war brings” said Raytheon CEO Thomas A. Kennedy explaining that a single machine would be able to match the poetic output of several thousand PTSD-ravaged veterans. “Within minutes of deployment the Laureate-IV can assess the situation on the ground and draft plaintive lines about what it’s like to survive an IED ambush only to be left holding a 20-year-old’s intestines in as he bleeds out from a shrapnel wound his dreams for life disappearing with the wind-blown desert sands.”“The result will be beautiful hauntingly descriptive verse” the executive added.According to Raytheon the robot which composes sublime poetry about being shipped off to an unfamiliar place and then told to kill strangers for reasons you don’t understand has been outfitted with several features such as the continuous-track treads that will allow the machine to explore the smoldering craters left behind after bombs have hit a hospital or wedding party.Engineers confirmed the AI apparatus is equipped with 360-degree optical sensors that can pinpoint thousands of variables during a firefight and from a distance of 600 meters zoom in on a single tear running down the face of a traumatized soot-covered child. The machine can then render this imagery in a very sparse minimalist poem that evokes the emptiness and futility of war company officials stated.“In the past it would have been necessary to send entire battalions overseas with the hope that at least one surviving soldier would be able to portray the terrible chaos of urban warfare the deafening blasts of aerial bombardments and the ghastly screams of dying comrades in incredibly moving works of poetry” said Gen. Joseph Dunford chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “But with this new technology we can strategically deploy a handful of robots to deftly encapsulate in verse the existential despair that results from seeing a buddy survive dozens of combat missions and then die a random meaningless death in a friendly fire accident just days before his tour was set to end.” Added Dunford “I look forward to reading these brilliantly desolate and disconsolate poems forged in the savage crucible of war.”Raytheon representatives acknowledged the company experimented with verse-composing computers during the Vietnam War its earliest prototypes taking up entire warehouses but the simplistic and often trite poetry they produced could not successfully depict the complex ungraspable nature of war and ultimately failed to bear vital witness to that troubling conflict.In recent years however the robot’s developers have reportedly been able to employ modern neural networks to refine their systems and work out several bugs such as the defect that caused the Laureate-I to fill page after page with nothing but the words “We are all pigs to the slaughter.” The engineers expressed hope of following their poetic success with a robot that can write 1500-page epic novels that dramatize the disparate points of view of dozens of characters all experiencing the same horrific moments of combat.Officials from Raytheon confirmed they are also exploring commercial applications for the technology and may one day allow the public to purchase robots that write poems capturing the listless mundanity of civilian life.
2018-02-13T14:00:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/ra-wins-westminster-god-show-1822961049,Ra Wins Westminster God Show,NEW YORK—Commending his healthy frame impeccable lineage and ability to form light and order from the primordial chaos judges announced Thursday that Egyptian deity Ra has taken top honors at the 141st annual Westminster God Show.The purebred Egyptian sun god who competed against divinities from more than 290 recognized pantheons—including Roman gods of war trickster deities and the Mesopotamian Anunnaki—reportedly overcame stiff competition to impress judges with high marks in gait ear shape and all-around omnipotence ultimately winning best in show.“Since 1877 the Westminster God Show has conferred its highest award upon only the most distinguished of deities and Ra is without question one of the finest specimens we’ve ever seen” said judge Allison Brand citing the distinguished pedigree of the 26000-year-old creator of all life who sired himself from the endless void and infinite night. “His victory is especially impressive when you consider this year’s incredibly competitive field. [Japanese storm god] Susanoo-no-Mikoto for instance really thrilled us when he rode the crest of a tsunami across the show floor and summoned the power of lightning to defeat the evil spirits of the world.”“But at the end of the day Ra is just a tremendously pretty god” she continued as she patted the deity’s falcon head and presented his handler with a purple-and-gold ribbon.Judges at the Westminster God Show which takes place each year at Madison Square Garden told reporters they subject deities to the highest levels of scrutiny evaluating them on criteria that include miracle performance disciple loyalty and ability to herd souls into the afterlife. Officials noted that even small flaws can prove disastrous for a divine entrant as was the case this year when Tezcatlipoca Aztec god of the night sky received low marks on his build after a judge’s inspection revealed his testicles were slightly mismatched.To avoid such pitfalls handlers typically spend hours in the caged-off god-grooming area where earlier this week they could be seen feeding hearts of the damned to Egyptian underworld goddess Ammit and rubbing coconut oil on four-armed Hindu god Ganesha to ensure he had a silky red coat for the show’s inspection portion.“For Ra to be crowned champion several fan-favorite gods unfortunately had to lose” said veteran Westminster announcer Nigel Masters who described an incident in which the highly favored Kuba giant god Mbombo was disqualified after becoming sick and vomiting the sun stars and moon onto the artificial turf of the competition ring. “Many expected Hephaestus to win it all this year but his maimed foot lost him serious points. In the end he didn’t even place well in his own fire-god division.”According to historical records the Westminster God Show has changed its rules of competition substantially over the years most notably in 1938 when it relaxed its purebred restriction to include a demigod category. This reportedly led to the 1947 victory of Odin-sired Sæmingr and more recently a 1993 runner-up prize for the Lord Jesus Christ who was said to have impressed judges with His even-keeled temperament and strong bite.Like most winners before him Ra is expected to move on to a lucrative career in studding unless like 2015 best-in-show recipient Uranus he is castrated with a sickle and has his genitals thrown into the sea.“From the first time I saw Ra weep his tears falling to the earth to create humanity itself I knew he was something special but this is truly a great honor” said 57-year-old Gerald Simons the sun god’s longtime handler. “It’s been extraordinary to watch him come up from the literal vast expanse of nothingness to form the land the sky and the underworld. He’s a very good god. Yes he is!”“Somebody deserves a treat” he added as he pet the solar disk floating above Ra’s head and gestured toward a sacrificial bull in a nearby handling crate.At press time sources reported that the remainder of the award ceremony had been delayed after Jörmungandr winner of this year’s top serpent-god accolades slipped free from his leash and destroyed all of existence.
2018-02-09T15:30:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/u-s-military-heightens-security-after-another-group-of-1822882300,U.S. Military Heightens Security After Another Group Of Precocious Children Sneaks Onto Base To Save Alien Friend,ARLINGTON VA—In what many are calling a long-overdue response to a clear weak spot in the defenses of U.S. military facilities the Pentagon issued a new series of security guidelines Friday after confirming another group of precocious children had infiltrated a base and rescued an alien friend.The Defense Department which has acknowledged six such incidents in the past year alone said the updated protocols would be implemented at all domestic military installations eliminating the security flaws that currently allow any building housing an extraterrestrial to be accessed by a scrawny kid whose friends convince him to squeeze through the ventilation shaft. The new directives also reportedly prohibit checkpoint guards from waving through 12-year-olds who pull up in their mom’s station wagon display their older brother’s driver’s license and claim to be catering a party for the base commander. “Somehow these top-level security breaches keep happening so we’re putting tougher safeguards in place to stop our most sensitive assets from falling into the hands of troublemaking youths” Pentagon spokesperson Col. Graham Stevens said of the plucky children who relying on nothing but their wits determination and a few homemade gadgets have repeatedly managed to hoodwink the most powerful military on earth to set free a beloved alien buddy. “We must make our base perimeters impenetrable to brainy kids armed with devices they have cobbled together from remote-control car parts and a See ’N Say pull-string toy.”“The fact that we’ve allowed young children to escape with highly classified alien life forms this many times is an embarrassment frankly” Stevens added.Sources reported that the threat level had been raised to FPCON Bravo at all U.S. military bases holding lovable alien beings and that 12000-volt electric fences will soon replace the facilities’ chain-link barriers which are vulnerable to elementary school students using bolt cutters to open a hole big enough for their friends to sneak inside. The new measures also reportedly call for extensive surveillance upgrades including a plan to place security cameras outside the range of Silly String cans. In addition reports indicated the military would spend millions of dollars on new signal-jamming hardware that can disrupt communications from G.I. Joe–brand walkie-talkies.According to Pentagon officials the most significant new guidelines are those requiring more sophisticated encryption for Defense Department servers which at present can be hacked into by any fifth-grader with an old Commodore 64 a bent piece of wire inexplicably covered in foil and a working knowledge of BASIC. This is believed to allow children to locate the containment unit holding the space creature they befriended just a few weeks earlier in most cases after they found it starving in the woods and went to a nearby fast-food chain to buy it cheeseburgers which the alien could reportedly never get enough of.“Make no mistake these kids are criminals and for too long military intelligence has underestimated their capabilities” said Stevens citing the example of a child whodespite having no camouflage in his closet at home managed to avoid detection on a highly secure base by wearing a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle costume and blending in with the bushes. “They have managed to short-circuit our state-of-the-art electronic locks using nothing more than a fork a wad of bubble gum and a digital watch. Strictly speaking that shouldn’t even be possible but it has become an issue we must address.”“Admittedly there have been some oversights on our part such as deciding to build security systems that can be shut down with the flip of a single switch on an electrical panel located in a poorly guarded utility room” he continued.Stevens went on to state that the military had already court-martialed more than a dozen elderly guards who had dozed off as they watched small black-and-white televisions in their security booths allowing groups of schoolchildren and their alien friends to quietly creep past.The Pentagon announced that all military personnel would undergo an intensive training program aimed at helping them to counter the tactics commonly employed by these gangs of kids who have been known to scout out bases ahead of time using a View-Master create diversions by setting off firecrackers and lure guards away from their posts with what appears at first to be a beautiful woman experiencing car trouble but turns out to be a mannequin voiced by a tape recording of a preteen boy.“The problem is that once these kids escape with our alien specimen in tow it’s gone for good” said 1st Lt. Dusty Neuberger a military lab technician at an undisclosed base in the Utah desert who told reporters meddling children have at this point set back research on extraterrestrial life by decades. “We try to catch them as they pedal away on their dirt bikes but inevitably all our tanks Humvees and armored personnel carriers crash during the chase that ensues and the kids disappear back to their suburban neighborhood taking their space friend with them.”At press time Pentagon officials were hailing the new initiative a success after a group of tenacious children attempting to gain access to a military facility were taken out by a Special Forces sniper team.
2017-12-14T11:32:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/estee-lauder-expedition-stumbles-upon-frozen-remains-of-1821294709,Estée Lauder Expedition Stumbles Upon Frozen Remains Of Previous Party Sent To Retrieve Rare Moisturizing Herb In The Himalayas,MAKALU NEPAL—After uncovering four corpses buried in snow along an icy mountain ridge members of an Estée Lauder expedition said Thursday they had found the remains of a party lost decades ago while searching for a unique moisturizing herb thought to grow deep in the Himalayas.The explorers now three weeks into their ascent of a nearly 27000-foot peak radioed back to their base camp when they came upon the grim scene reportedly all that is left of a failed 1961 Lauder expedition that sought to obtain samples of the rare herb which is said to possess anti-aging properties so powerful it can instantly rejuvenate the driest and most wrinkled skin.“We discovered four human bodies completely encrusted in a thick layer of ice as well as a campsite littered with oxygen tanks broken ice picks and empty tins of lip balm” said Clara Faherty head of the current expedition who confirmed that one of the bodies belonged to Franklin Ames the American beautician who led the 1961 group and had previously discovered an essential oil in the Amazon rainforest that eliminates split ends. “The freezing cold had turned their faces twisted in agony to an almost pure white. Ames himself appeared to have been crawling on his hands and knees reaching out his hand in a final attempt to grab the legendary nourishing and revitalizing plant that was just beyond his fingertips.”“Tragically they all froze to death just a few feet away from the secret to beautiful radiant skin” she added.According to historians attempts to locate the fabled herb date back to the early 20th century when a British explorer discovered a remote Himalayan village where the inhabitants possessed a strange otherworldly glow and appeared to maintain completely smooth and blemish-free skin well into old age. For years experts considered the existence of a plant that purified and refreshed skin while visibly reducing pores to be mere legend but then in 1953 a Neutrogena executive visited a Kathmandu market and purchased a mysterious herbal extract that could instantly erase wrinkles and lines in ways never before seen by Western cosmetologists.Company records indicate that skin-care companies such as L’Oréal Olay and Jergens soon began to scour mountainsides from Kashmir to Tibet in search of the herb. Of these efforts the Lauder expedition of ’61 was the most famous with stories persisting that Ames and his team had succeeded but never returned—a rumor fueled by local tales of a group of white men with clear and vibrant skin who lived in a nearby village and didn’t look a day over 30.Faherty said she was able to confirm the four dead bodies were from the lost expedition after she discovered Ames’ diary in an ice-encrusted knapsack at the campsite.“The last entries suggest one man abandoned the group and walked off into a blizzard after he developed hideous bags under his eyes while several others went mad and turned on each other after they ran out of hand lotion” said Faherty describing Ames’ account of crazed men who started a brawl during which half of their meager food and exfoliating rations fell into a crevasse and were lost. “Things got so desperate they began trying to hydrate their skin with snow which we now know just ends up leaving you even more dry and cracked than before. The conditions must have been unbearable.”“One of the corpses had his fingertips frozen to his face as if he were still trying to moisturize even in death” Faherty added.The current Estée Lauder team reported that they were able to gather several small samples of the storied herb to bring back home and were hoping it would live up to its ability to draw out built-up impurities and liven up lackluster skin. However Faherty acknowledged she had developed some concerns about unlocking the plant’s mythical age-defying powers.“The longer I’m in these mountains the more I wonder if perhaps mankind was never meant to possess such perfectly firm and supple skin” she said noting that the native name of the ridge where the herb was found could be roughly translated as “land of silky smooth skin and death.” “This is the holy grail of cosmetics. But what if its powers which we still don’t understand come at a horrible price?”At press time sources confirmed that all members Faherty’s party had vanished without a trace and were presumed dead having last been heard over the radio threatening to murder each other over the last leaf of the rare miraculous herb.
2017-12-07T12:16:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/report-83-of-player-pianos-set-off-by-gunfight-1821089650,Report: 83% Of Player Pianos Set Off By Gunfight,AUSTIN TX—In an investigation of the phenomenon’s tendency to occur during barroom brawls a report published Thursday concluded that 83 percent of cases in which a player piano spontaneously begins to play were on account of a couple local ruffians went and got themselves into a gunfight.A team at the University of Texas analyzed data from saloons watering holes and brothels across the western frontier and found 428 instances in which right after some no-good rascal had shot off his Colt .45 a self-playing piano began hammering out a spirited rendition of “Oh! Susanna.” The report stated that the majority of these cases resulted when disputations between two ol’ scoundrels got out of hand causing guns to be drawn and starting an all-out tussle that darn near wrecked the entire premises. “Our findings indicate that roughly four out of every five player pianos are set off by a stray bullet either when a notorious outlaw is finally cornered by a young gun or when pistols are fired in a bordello following a quarrel over a kindhearted prostitute” said the report’s lead author Marina Fuller noting that in most cases the piano continued to play right up to the moment the sheriff arrived and fired his gun into the air putting a stop to the whole ruckus. “We also observed quite a few cases in which as soon as the player piano started up a grizzled old-timer who had been asleep in the corner jerked awake and began to pick out a rollicking accompaniment on his banjo.”She added “Even in cases when a bullet ricocheted off the bar before shattering some unsuspecting fellow’s whiskey glass mid-sip it usually set off the player piano along the way.”According to the report an additional 11 percent of player pianos began playing when some lucky prospector who had just struck it rich got hit over the head with a jug of wine fell off the second-story balustrade and landed on the instrument while another 6 percent started up when a fancy man from back East was thrown down the full length of the bar smashing into every beer mug along the way and flying headlong into the piano. Researchers confirmed that in approximately a third of these fights a bullet went through a huge barrel labeled “XXX” causing moonshine to pour directly into the mouth of the town drunk who had staggered in and passed out near the bar. In nearly every instance the dusty old piano reportedly began to play even faster as the gunfight escalated.“Interestingly we noticed these pianos will cease playing immediately—right in the middle of the song—if at any point during the shootout a famed gunslinger rumored to have died steps into the bar and causes the stunned brawlers to stop dead in their tracks” Fuller said. “Otherwise these altercations tend to continue until all the furniture in the saloon has been broken over someone’s head and the entire melee has poured out onto the street.”“These types of scuffles can even spill over into the Women’s Temperance League meeting going on next door forcing the ladies in attendance to fan themselves and run out of the building” she continued.The report stressed that the best way to stay safe during such gunfights is to jump inside a barrel to hide though it also warned that if a man pokes his head out to see what’s going on he’s liable to get his hat shot clean off the top of his dang noggin.
2017-11-29T13:58:05-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/bangor-police-bring-in-stephen-king-to-help-track-demon-1820848385,Bangor Police Bring In Stephen King To Help Track Demonic Car That Killed Woman,BANGOR ME—Admitting their investigation was at a standstill local law enforcement officials told reporters Wednesday they had enlisted the help of bestselling author Stephen King to track down a demonic automobile accused of killing an area woman.Authorities made the decision to contact the award-winning writer after failing to develop any significant leads in the case according to a spokesperson for the Bangor Police Department. Though they say the 70-year-old’s often arrogant and prickly demeanor makes him difficult to work with detectives confirmed they are hoping King’s specialized insight will help them locate the bloodthirsty and allegedly homicidal vehicle.“Let me guess: It looks like a classic hit-and-run but the car that mowed her down didn’t leave a trace of physical evidence” King said as he arrived at the crime scene lifting the caution tape with his cane and hobbling toward a group of officers. “The victim has a boyfriend but you already talked to him and he’s got an airtight alibi for the night in question and no record of criminal history. So you’ve got no means no motive and no opportunity—all of which means you’re screwed even before you take into account the fact that you’re dealing with the insatiable appetite for murder that inhabits the souls of the damned.”“I take it from the stupid blank looks on everyone’s faces that I’m right so far” he added.Openly scoffing at the detectives’ working theory that a shape-shifting poltergeist had assumed the form of a car King reportedly explained to officers that the clinical efficiency of the attack suggested instead a corporeal vehicle possessed by the soul of a serial killer.Bangor police chief Alex Ingraham acknowledged that the celebrated novelist and longtime Maine resident has assisted with a number of high-profile cases over the years including one in which a telekinetic teenager destroyed a local high school gym and another in which a bloodsucking undead being and his elderly caretaker conspired to turn all the residents of a nearby town into vampires.Sources said that while inspecting the scene of the hit-and-run King cleared away some brush near a bend in the road and revealed a tire tread the forensics team had overlooked.“These tracks were made by Firestone whitewalls and considering how long ago those went out of fashion I’d say we’re looking for a vintage automobile being driven by the deranged ghost of its former owner” King said to the investigators gathering around him. “Now that this entity has gotten a taste for blood it’s going to start seeking revenge on anyone it feels may have wronged it. That means the clock’s ticking if we want to prevent another murder.”“Start pulling files on any unusual or mysterious deaths that took place in a car 60 or 70 years ago” he continued. “And put out an APB for anyone driving a Plymouth Fury or an antique Buick Roadmaster who appears agitated and is dressed like a 1950s-era greaser.”While Ingraham has said he appreciates King’s uncanny ability to get inside the head of unknowably dark and malevolent forces to reconstruct the events at a crime scene the police chief has privately expressed concern that prolonged exposure to the blood-soaked handiwork of evil spirits has taken an emotional toll on the author. Sources close to King have stated that his gruff exterior is a façade that masks a sensitive persona still racked with guilt by the one crime he was never able to solve: The grisly stabbing deaths of a family serving as caretakers for a haunted ski lodge.“I’m only going to say this once so try to get it through that thick skull of yours” King said to a lieutenant after being informed that a search of the police database hadn’t yielded any results for the car in question. “The vengeful specter inhabiting this old car will have transformed the vehicle back to its brand-new original state so unless you’re running plates from the Eisenhower administration nothing’s going to show up.”“Now while I’m over here doing your job and actually stopping people from getting murdered by a four-wheeled demon why don’t you make yourself useful and grab me a cup of coffee?” he added.At press time after learning the suspected vehicle had last been registered to one Randall Flagg an ashen-faced King was overheard mumbling to himself that all his past cases might somehow be connected.
2017-11-28T13:54:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/the-onion-has-obtained-exclusive-information-from-jai-1820808638,‘The Onion’ Has Obtained Exclusive Information From Jaime Phillips About Roy Moore’s Sexual Indiscretions,In the troubled politically charged times in which our country finds itself The Onion takes great pride in being the sole beacon of truth and integrity in journalism. No matter how explosive the revelations brought to light by our sources no matter how their publication may upset the established order this storied newspaper has sworn an oath to provide the American people with the facts necessary to serve as informed democratic citizens.Today after an exclusive series of interviews with accuser Jaime T. Phillips The Onion was able to publish just such a story revealing that Alabama senatorial candidate Roy Moore impregnated her during a sexual relationship conducted while she was 15 years old.These are the facts provided directly to us by Ms. Phillips in a series of on-the-record interviews conducted over the past 24 hours: 1) That in 1992 while spending a summer in Alabama a teenage Ms. Phillips began a secret relationship with a then-55-year-old Roy Moore. 2) That during this relationship Roy Moore repeatedly had sexual intercourse with her leading to a pregnancy. 3) That at Mr. Moore’s instruction Ms. Philips underwent a secretive abortion.To our editorial board’s knowledge no other news source has been entrusted with this incredible story. Indeed in her first phone call to us Ms. Philips repeatedly insisted that The Onion was her first and only choice to bring forth such allegations. Why did she entrust America’s Finest News Source with these groundbreaking details? Perhaps she knew other newspapers would be intimidated into cowardly silence by the far-reaching fallout from these revelations. Perhaps she was simply conscious of our lengthy history of award-winning and earth-shattering reportage and she knew no other publication would do.Whatever the reason the evidence corroborating her story is insurmountable.Unquestionably this dramatic account required fact-checking of the caliber only The Onion can provide and while several small inconsistencies emerged—notably the employer that Ms. Phillips provided us NFM Lending had no knowledge of her existence and denied she ever held a position there—the common-sense explanation from Ms. Phillips that she “worked remotely” and that we had “called the wrong branch” quickly put to bed any doubt that would prevent her account’s publication. Similarly despite timely considerations such as the coming December election in which Mr. Moore will serve as the GOP candidate and the coming Pulitzer Prize nominations for which this story may be eligible readers can dispel any notion that this journalistic enterprise was rushed to publication. Simply put The Onion is willing to stake its nearly 252-year history of sterling unbiased reportage upon the verity of these claims.In less than two weeks citizens in Alabama must make a choice on who they will propel into the profound duty of serving in the United States Senate. With these heinous allegations—and the bravery of Ms. Phillips—in mind we are confident they will make the correct choice.
2017-11-16T11:28:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/confident-philadelphia-officials-preemptively-raze-cent-1820509855,Confident Philadelphia Officials Preemptively Raze Center City To Make Room For Amazon Headquarters,PHILADELPHIA—Convinced they will win the highly competitive contest to host the e-commerce giant’s new offices optimistic local officials have preemptively razed Philadelphia’s entire Center City district to make room for Amazon’s second North American headquarters sources said Thursday. According to the mayor’s office the decision to completely level the downtown region was reached as city leaders became increasingly confident that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos would eventually come to realize Philadelphia was the best of the 238 localities across the United States Mexico and Canada bidding to become the online retailer’s new center of operations. Over the past few weeks city employees have reportedly worked around the clock to relocate the area’s more than 57000 residents while demolition crews have knocked down thousands of homes businesses and cultural sites. “After taking a look at the competition and figuring we probably have this thing in the bag we just went ahead and tore down Center City so Amazon can move right in” said Mayor Jim Kenney noting that destroying Philadelphia’s central business district was “an easy call” and that he was proud of the city’s campaign to woo the company with promotional videos full-page newspaper ads and endorsements from state politicians and local celebrities. “We look forward to all the jobs and economic benefits that will be coming our way once Amazon decides to call what used to be Center City home.”“Between Philadelphia’s great transit system its reasonable cost of living and the fact that there are now two square miles of completely open space in the heart of the city I can’t see any reason why they wouldn’t want to come here” he added.Kenney showed reporters an interactive mockup of what Amazon’s campus might look like with new roads crisscrossing the former Rittenhouse Square to service numerous office towers. He said it would be hard for the company to turn down a bid that would allow it to construct its own modern business-friendly environment on the vacated sites of more than a dozen historic neighborhoods including Penn’s Landing Logan Square and Society Hill.The mayor went on to observe that Amazon would have a unique opportunity to put its own mark on the city now that the Inquirer Building the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul and Love Park have all been bulldozed.“It was definitely bittersweet saying goodbye to the Liberty Bell before our controlled demolition of Independence Hall but it’s important we encourage businesses to invest in the city” said Kenney adding that his office was also evicting 100000 Philadelphia residents living outside of Center City in order to give relocating Amazon employees access to homes and schools in the most desirable neighborhoods. “Philadelphians should rest assured however that we will work to preserve access to our beloved city’s historic legacy. We may even use revenue from the expanded tax base Amazon will provide to help build a high-speed rail service running to the area 30 miles south of town where all our art museums and hospitals are now located.”“We’re willing to do whatever it takes to ensure Amazon chooses Philadelphia whether that requires tax incentives infrastructure upgrades or filling the Schuylkill River with concrete to create more parking” he continued. “I’m sure it’s just a matter of time until it’s all official.”At press time Amazon officials announced that Philadelphia had failed to qualify for the next round of bidding.
2017-10-25T12:22:58-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/vatican-city-zoo-struggling-to-breed-first-angel-in-cap-1819844920,Vatican City Zoo Struggling To Breed First Angel In Captivity,VATICAN CITY—After months of failed attempts to coax their sole mating pair into conceiving officials from the Vatican City Zoo admitted Wednesday that they were unsure whether the facility would ever successfully breed an angel in captivity.The current effort is reportedly part of an ongoing campaign by the zoo home to Christendom’s most diverse collection of holy fauna to increase the world’s angelic population which has dwindled to fewer than 400 heavenly creatures in the wild.“No systematic attempt to breed winged celestial beings outside their natural habitat in everlasting paradise has ever succeeded so this is a daunting task” said the zoo’s director Cardinal Lorenzo Menichelli who explained that creating the ideal conditions for procreative intercourse would require theobiologists to learn more about angel fertility cycles and courtship rituals. “While there have been occasional signs of a potential pregnancy such as elevated hormone levels or a dilated halo each has unfortunately turned out to be a false alarm.”“Nevertheless we still hope that one day we will welcome a new baby angel into our zoo’s Heavenly Messenger Pavilion” he added.According to sources within the Holy See zoo staff built an approximation of the angels’ natural habitat to facilitate breeding installing sidewalks paved with gold throughout their concrete enclosure and a $300000 motion-activated mist system to simulate clouds. Reports also confirmed that a special secluded cage has been set up as far away as possible from the exhibit’s main viewing platform which is often crowded with photo-snapping bishops and loud Sunday school children known to discourage angelic coition.However despite the zoo’s best efforts Menichelli said the male and female angels seldom show interest in each other and on the rare occasions they do the pair often becomes spooked prior to the act of copulation by sounds coming from the Leviathan and Behemoth cages in the nearby Hall of Beasts. The cardinal added that the problem is compounded by the fact that female angels are only in heat once every jubilee year.“We’ve tried numerous techniques to stimulate their libidinal urges—chanting devotional hymns bestowing our blessings upon their loins and bathing them in the shimmering light of God’s pure grace” said Menichelli adding that the zoo had recently ordered several gallons of highly pungent angel testosterone which is known to induce estrus in reluctant females. “We even showed them video clips of other angels mating to activate their instinctual reproductive cues but they refused to watch it and then began anxiously making the sign of the cross.”“Our experience has been quite different with the Nephilim which breed like rabbits” hecontinued noting that the biblical race of giants had come a long way since the 19th century when they were targeted by trophy hunters and nearly went extinct. “If we didn’t keep them isolated we’d have a new litter every week.”Records indicate the zoo’s latest angelic breeding project follows a series of botched efforts dating back to the early 1970s. In a widely publicized 1984 incident an attempt to mate two seraphim on loan from the Lourdes Zoo and Aquarium failed when the much larger and more aggressive male shouted “Holy holy holy is the Lord of Hosts; the whole Earth is full of His glory!” and proceeded to tear the wings off the female setting the program back by more than a decade.“Angel husbandry is a difficult process but we’re not giving up” Menichelli said. “These magnificent creatures are the most popular attraction at the zoo apart from the Demon Pit and the Botanical Garden of Eden and we’re committed to making it something that visitors to the Vatican can enjoy from now until the Second Coming.”Menichelli confirmed the zoo would try artificial insemination next just as soon as it received the Church’s permission to collect a sample.
2017-10-18T09:06:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/new-evidence-reveals-pythagoras-wrote-dozens-of-unhinge-1819655096,New Evidence Reveals Pythagoras Wrote Dozens Of Unhinged Conspiracy Theorems About Triangles,CAMBRIDGE MA—A trove of recently unearthed documents dating back to the sixth century B.C. has revealed that the ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras wrote dozens of elaborate unhinged conspiracy theorems pertaining to triangles researchers announced Wednesday.Upon examining a cache of papyrus scrolls found while excavating a site near the modern Italian city of Crotone a team of historians and classical scholars at Harvard University discovered previously unknown writings by Pythagoras and others that suggest the philosopher was obsessed with proving triangles played a powerful but highly secretive role in the world he inhabited controlling nearly every aspect of life.“These conspiracy theorems shed new light on this historic figure who was apparently suspicious of the fact that all triangles have interior angles adding up to 180 degrees believing this was evidence that they were united in hiding some sort of covert agenda” said Professor Janet Boisvert who found among the artifacts an alternative version of the Pythagorean theorem in which Pythagoras concluded that the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle was equal to the sum of “all the lies embodied by these cursed triangles!” “One scroll is 35 feet long and contains nothing but a rambling series of postulates attempting to demonstrate the existence of a triangle with three obtuse angles that he thought was being kept under wraps by the government.”“Pythagoras also stayed up every night for two years working on formulas he believed would prove the Great Pyramid at Giza was a hoax perpetrated by pro-triangle propagandists” she added.According to Boisvert Pythagoras’ fixation on conspiracy theorems was described in the written accounts of his students who recalled visiting his private study and finding the walls the tables and nearly every available surface covered in intricate equations and charts depicting hundreds of scalene isosceles and equilateral triangles. One student noted that Pythagoras always seemed worried by the sheer number of triangles he saw around him and he became extremely distraught one day upon realizing that quadrilaterals which he had until then considered innocuous were in fact nothing more than two triangles combined.This paranoia is further corroborated by the diary entry of a goatherd who described an elderly mathematician wandering the streets of Metapontum and warning complete strangers about the sails of ships the shapes of their own noses and the encroaching power of the trigonocracy.“We are now able to conclusively identify Pythagoras as the unnamed figure in the Histories of Herodotus who storms into a polis council meeting waving pages scrawled with formulas and screaming ‘Triangles are all around us hidden in every shape and I have the proofs!’ before being escorted out” Boisvert said. “He continued to demand the truth from local magistrates having hypothesized that triangles had a fourth invisible side that those in power didn’t want him to know about.”“It’s likely that by this point his obsession with conspiracy theorems had begun to take a toll on his home life” she continued. “We know an increasingly isolated Pythagoras was left by his wife and four children around 515 B.C. shortly after he accused they themselves of being triangles.”Documents indicate Pythagoras went on to live a hermetic existence in the foothills of Mount Parnassus until the realization that even the mountain itself had a triangular shape eventually drove him to suicide.
2017-10-13T14:15:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/historians-discover-meditation-spread-from-ancient-chin-1819580402,Historians Discover Meditation Spread From Ancient China By Annoying Monk Who Wouldn’t Shut Up About How It Changed His Life,NEW YORK—In a groundbreaking new study published Friday in The Journal Of East Asian Studies a team of leading historians has proved that meditation originally spread from ancient China because a single highly annoying monk went around telling everyone how much it had changed his life.Analyzing documents uncovered across the Eurasian continent researchers determined that the monk who lived in the seventh century A.D. and learned rudimentary breathing and visualization exercises from a group of Mahayana Buddhists traveled widely and talked constantly about how practicing meditation for only a week had fundamentally altered his personal outlook. From the Korean peninsula to the Central Asian steppes he is believed to have aggravated people everywhere he went inevitably shifting every conversation to the importance of mindfulness and being centered even when it was clear no one was interested.“Our research shows that from Mongolia all the way down to Java everyone hated this smug prick.”“There are mentions of an unbearably irritating monk in many texts from the period and once we realized they were all referring to the same person we were able to conclude that much of the Eastern world learned about meditation from this one sanctimonious asshole” said study co-author Sheila Ryan of New York University explaining that contemporary accounts indicated the monk would travel the Silk Road via merchant caravan nagging his drivers about the value of observing one’s negative thoughts without resistance or judgment. “For example scrolls from Asuka-period Japan indicate the island nation’s first exposure to the practice was this monk droning on and on about all the insight he’d gained from a weekend spent meditating in Tibet.“Our research shows that from Mongolia all the way down to Java everyone hated this smug prick” Ryan added.In the fragments that remain of their written correspondence traders who traveled the same routes as the monk remarked upon how every time a person said something negative the exasperating little shit would invariably chime in with unsolicited advice about how they just needed to accept their worries for what they were and learn to appreciate the present moment. Three separate diaries found far apart from one another in present-day Cambodia Bhutan and Afghanistan independently verify that whenever the monk bragged about his morning meditation routine people secretly wanted to punch him in the face.According to the historians the evidence they amassed has allowed them to confirm that a figure who appears in several gombi-style paintings from the period is in fact this same monk. In one typical depiction which places the monk in the ancient city-state of Srivijaya around 680 A.D. he is seen sitting on a mat and meditating in the middle of a busy market square as visibly annoyed passersby shuffle past many of them appearing to shake their heads roll their eyes or stare at him in quiet derision. To this day scholars have observed oral histories passed down for centuries in remote parts of rural China tell of a monk who pestered the fuck out of everyone he could find until they reluctantly agreed to attend his shitty introduction to mindfulness course.“In his extensive travelogues the Tang dynasty writer Yi Jing describes an episode in which a man we now believe to have been this monk continually disrupts a hard-at-work blacksmith with lectures about how the mind is a muscle that must be exercised just like any other” Ryan said. “Apparently the only thing this pain-in-the-ass ever talked about was how spending 10 minutes a day focusing on his breathing had made him more relaxed and productive. He kept badgering everyone to let him lead them through a guided meditation so they could see how great it was. Some people even tried it just to get him to shut the fuck up.”“Our findings suggest he spread meditation to as much as 40 percent of Asia” she continued. “He might have kept going too but after the monk told the Khmer emperor Jayavarman II that his empire would be much larger if he just tried a few simple stress-reduction techniques he was beheaded on the spot.”
2017-10-10T13:32:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/millions-of-moms-set-out-on-pilgrimage-to-premium-outle-1819580391,Millions Of Moms Set Out On Pilgrimage To Premium Outlet Center,CENTRAL VALLEY NY—According to reports from across the country millions of moms set out Saturday morning on a mass pilgrimage to the premium outlet center following in the footsteps of mothers before them who for ages have participated in the same sacred rite.The moms many of whom undertook arduous journeys of more than two hours reportedly sought to attain discounts of up to 65 percent on name-brand fashions and accessories braving the teeming throngs of fellow pilgrims who inevitably overwhelmed the parking garages and landscaped pedestrian walkways of the venerated site.“Oh my God it’s so beautiful. I’m in awe just being here and seeing these incredible bargains with my own eyes” said Philadelphia-area mom Debbie Palmer 41 as she walked her first of several ritual circles around Dior Armani Exchange Ralph Lauren and two dozen other hallowed storefronts. “It wasn’t easy traveling here but it was worth it for the opportunity to take part in something like this. It’s truly overwhelming. Everything’s on clearance and the huge savings are just so inspiring.”“I wasn’t prepared for just how transformational this day would be” added Palmer wiping away a tear as she picked up a five-piece hand towel set marked down to $23.99. “It’s a dream come true.”“I wasn’t prepared for just how transformational this day would be. It’s a dream come true.”Clad in the traditional pilgrim’s garb of comfort-fit jeans a light jacket and Aerosoles slip-ons a sea of mothers—who timed their journeys to coincide with annual Columbus Day weekend sales—reportedly swarmed in front of the outlet center’s directory and performed ceremonial invocations reciting the names and map coordinates of the retailers they wished to visit. Sources said that in keeping with tradition the amassed moms then congregated around a scarf in a Burberry window display and chanted “Oh that’s cute” before continuing on to the Nike Factory Store Last Call by Neiman Marcus and Zwilling J.A. Henckels.According to witnesses most of the pilgrims only paused in their spiritual quest to partake in the modest meal of a small no-topping Pinkberry cup or to make their way down the narrow thoroughfare between the Clarins and Ferragamo stores to where the “nice bathrooms” are. Soon after their arrival reports confirmed mothers were already bedecked in a variety of shopping bags from the outlet center’s more than 200 holy sites and as the day wore on many within the swelling overheated crowds could be seen removing their windbreakers and tying them around their waists.“For as long as I can remember I’ve felt that I had to make this journey and experience the marked-down prices for myself” said Bethany Haskell of Baltimore a 39-year-old mom who bowed alongside dozens of other women to inspect a set of Crate & Barrel candleholders. “Yes there were obstacles: a missed turn on Google Maps getting a good parking spot near the entrance standing in long lines for fitting rooms with moms who didn’t even speak my language. But it’s all worth it once you’re at the register getting two really great handbags for the price of one.”Sources told reporters that due to the massive influx of mothers the site perennially suffers from overcrowding as evidenced by the significant wait time required to purchase decaf hazelnut coffee at the Pret a Manger. In addition they said pilgrims routinely require medical assistance especially elderly grandmothers who are in poor health but have nonetheless devoted themselves to purchasing early Christmas presents at the Samsonite and Yankee Candle stores.“I can’t describe how overwhelmed and happy I felt the moment I walked into the Tommy Hilfiger outlet and saw a pair of khakis that was just perfect for my little Miles” said Mary Alvarez 36 a Boston-area mother of three. “But getting 25 percent off bed linens for the whole family was the most thrilling part. And it’s so great to know that one day when my daughters are old enough they too will have this wonderful experience.” “This has reaffirmed my faith in designer labels which I truly believe are available to anyone willing to endure hardships and make sacrifices for them” she added.At press time reports confirmed that more than 300 mothers had been crushed in a stampede after the North Face suddenly marked down all its fur-lined winter coats to half price.
2017-09-27T14:37:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/nasa-s-mars-roomba-begins-mission-to-clean-dust-from-pl-1819580347,NASA’s Mars Roomba Begins Mission To Clean Dust From Planet’s Surface,PASADENA CA—As part of ongoing preparations for a manned mission to the Red Planet scientists at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory announced Wednesday that its autonomous Mars Roomba vehicle had landed safely and commenced the task of cleaning dust from the planet’s surface.A NASA spokesperson confirmed that the circular 1900-pound self-navigating vacuum had survived the 8-month journey from Earth with all vital sweeping and suction systems intact and had already begun removing iron oxide particles and small debris from the approximately 55.9 million square miles of Martian terrain.“At this rate we project that the entire planet will be spick and span by the time the first astronauts arrive.”“We’re pleased to say that after years of planning the Mars Roomba is finally hard at work cleaning some of the dustiest parts of the Red Planet” said senior engineer James Wurzburg describing the jubilant scene at mission control after the Roomba successfully touched down and immediately started vacuuming loose pebbles and dust kicked up by its retrorockets during descent. “Everything from the bristle brushes to the satellite mapping software is currently functioning as designed. In fact the Roomba has already made significant progress in tidying up the Schiaparelli Crater.”“At this rate we project that the entire planet will be spick and span by the time the first astronauts arrive” added Wurzburg.According to NASA officials the Mars Roomba uses a number of advanced features to navigate and clean up around its environment including independently spinning tracks of all-terrain wheels that allow it to turn a full 360 degrees while traveling at a maximum speed of 1.3 kilometers per hour and an array of proximity sensors that can discern steep slopes and prevent it from accidentally plunging into a canyon. Additionally NASA personnel confirmed the autonomous cleaning vehicle includes a contact-detecting front bumper that signals it to change directions whenever it encounters a large boulder or other obstacle. For power mission engineers confirmed that the Mars Roomba employs a portable nuclear reactor that provides up to three sols worth of cleaning time before the vehicle is forced to return to its self-charging station.Prior to the Roomba’s launch researchers reportedly spent six years testing various prototypes in a particularly dusty and desolate stretch of the Nevada desert ultimately settling on a lightweight design that could remove all dirt down to the bedrock.“If we’re ever going to establish a long-term colony it’s crucial that the planet is tidy” said project director Kaitlyn Mendoza highlighting the potential danger of future astronauts tracking muck all over the place. “The first Mars cleaning rover we sent in 1997 Sterility had a pair of radio-controlled mop and bucket arms but those just resulted in getting the Cydonia region all muddy. It’s a unique set of challenges compared to say the moon where we could just have Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin clean the whole lunar surface with push brooms.”“But fortunately everything is going to plan with the Roomba minus a brief period where it kept bumping into the Olympus Mons over and over” Mendoza continued.At press time NASA had announced a $37 billion mission to send someone to manually remove a large piece of meteorite that was clogging the Mars Roomba’s filter.
2017-09-18T09:35:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/fda-rents-party-house-upstate-to-test-new-drug-1819580325,FDA Rents Party House Upstate To Test New Drug,TOBYHANNA PA—With preclinical studies of an in-development cholesterol-reducing medication now complete Food and Drug Administration officials confirmed Monday they would be conducting initial trials of the new drug at a large party house they had rented in upstate Pennsylvania.According to the FDA around a dozen researchers will participate in the experimental pharmaceutical’s weekend-long test which is taking place in the Poconos at a 2500-square-foot lakeside cottage the agency found on Airbnb. The participating scientists will reportedly be the first humans to take the drug known as Bisovastatin studying its effects in a variety of settings from the indoor hot tub to the spacious deck out back.“Let’s get this fucking phase-zero trial started baby!”“Clinical testing is a vital step in the process of approving a medication and that’s why we’re up at this sweet cabin seeing if this shit’s the real deal” said Dr. Janet Woodcock director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research as her arriving colleagues passed around a joint “pregaming” before the new cholesterol treatment’s randomized controlled study began. “Whenever a drug makes it this far in the evaluation process we pack up [biochemist Simon F.] Hadley’s car grab some brews and head up here for a nonstop weekend of pharmacological safety and efficacy assessments.”“Let’s get this fucking phase-zero trial started baby!” Woodcock added. Sources confirmed that before traveling upstate FDA scientists obtained several hundred pills of Bisovastatin from pharmaceutical company AbbVie Inc. and stored them inside an empty bottle of ibuprofen. Upon reaching the five-bedroom house the researchers are said to have determined that its outdoor fire pit would provide the ideal clinical environment for staying up all night to observe the effects of the new drug on themselves and one another.The FDA stated that Dr. William Slikker Jr. director of the National Center for Toxicological Research volunteered to remain sober and babysit the others providing orange slices in the event the side effects of the drug became too overwhelming and one of the researchers needed to chill out. Officials said they wanted to avoid a repeat of an unfortunate 2015 incident in which a scientist who had taken way too much of a new myeloma treatment drug freaked out jumped through a third-floor window and broke both legs.“I’m definitely going to lie on the front lawn analyze how this drug inhibits the HMG-CoA enzyme and just stare up at the clouds” Woodcock said as the researchers all sat down on beanbag chairs in the party house’s loft to take their first dose of Bisovastatin together. “And I can’t wait to go into the woods where there are no distractions and you can really enjoy being out in nature as the stuff kicks in and your LDL levels start to go down.”“Of course part of our job is to observe how the drug interacts with other substances which is why we have this 30-pack of Bud Light and handle of Jim Beam” continued Woodcock noting that other researchers would try combining the drug with blood pressure medications and immunosuppressants. “Most of us are just sticking with the regular dose but [Dr.] Patrick [Caldwell] has a way higher tolerance so he’s going to take double to see if that does anything.”Several researchers said they planned to test Bisovastatin’s efficacy while lying in hammocks on the porch and using the house’s sound system to blast a Spotify playlist that had been created by the FDA’s Division of Pharmacometrics and was said to include selections from Animal Collective Black Lips and MGMT. Giuseppe Randazzo a director in the Office of Pharmaceutical Quality announced that he would be willing to take the new drug and have sex with a colleague at the same time in order to study “just how crazy that would be.”Woodcock remarked that you could never be sure what would happen during a night at the party house recalling that the last time they experimented with a cholesterol medication one of the researchers tried mixing it with a high dose of Klonopin and they later found him passed out on the dock in a diabetic coma.“We hope to emerge from the weekend with a clearer picture of whether this shit is good to go or whether we’ll have to decline approval of Bisovastatin for U.S. markets” Woodcock said. “But right now we got like 800 milligrams per person and we’re all ready to just kick back and enjoy two incredible days of mind-blowing research.”“Except for the people who got placebos” Woodcock added. “It sucks to be them.”

Maxx Recreates In-Store Shopping Experience With New Website That Randomly Scatters Products All Over The Place,FRAMINGHAM MA—Hoping to capture the “unique essence” of its discount retail stores for online customers T.J. Maxx unveiled a new website Wednesday that recreates its in-person shopping experience with a selection of miscellaneous products haphazardly strewn everywhere.Company CEO Ernie Herrman told reporters that the site—which features a disorganized jumble of closeout name-brand apparel and home fashions alongside a random inventory of neck pillows pill organizers cocktail olives and dozens of other items—would provide users with the same sense of disorientation that regularly overwhelms shoppers at the chain’s nearly 1200 brick-and-mortar locations.“Longtime T.J. Maxx customers should feel right at home when they visit us online.”“When you visit TJMaxx.com you’ll immediately be presented with an assortment of surplus clothing available exclusively in sizes that don’t fit you just as you would if you actually walked into one of our stores” said Herrman explaining that all merchandise on the website has three to five different prices attached to it or else no visible price at all. “Select ‘shoes’ from the drop-down menu and you’ll see scores of the same pair of Dolce Vita pumps a variety of sneaker styles for which only the left shoe is available some Tupperware without lids and the occasional ceramic owl.”He added “Longtime T.J. Maxx customers should feel right at home when they visit us online.”For their overhaul of the website company officials confirmed they had included thousands of new high-definition photos so users can zoom in on products such as fingerprint-smudged pint glasses; already-opened packets of decorative napkins; irregular garments with jagged misaligned seams; and handbags with their straps hopelessly tangled in a hair-dryer cord. According to reports online customers will also discover a completely redesigned maternity wear section which when clicked upon appears to consist of nothing but a single pig-shaped charcuterie board.In addition the site automatically redirects users through several pages of off-brand multicolored iPhone chargers and dusty caramel corn tins before they reach checkout at which point they reportedly may complete their transaction paying a price entirely different from what was listed.Herrman also noted that web users requiring assistance can avail themselves of a customer support chat box where in real-time a T.J. Maxx employee will answer any questions one asks with a terse “I don’t know” and then promptly log out ignoring any further inquiries.“If you’re a regular at our stores you’ll find exactly what you’ve come to expect from T.J. Maxx when you visit our website: girls’ bathing suits located right next to the salad spinners in the kitchen section and stud-loop leather belts pretty much everywhere” Herrman said. “And if you’ve never been to a T.J. Maxx before then log on and stock up on everything from throw pillows embroidered with inspirational messages to copies of Goodnight Moon with the cover torn off.”“We’re proud to serve anyone who’s willing to click on the page for our luggage department and spend a couple of minutes staring in bewilderment at a 2-foot-tall wooden ‘S’ accompanied by no identifying information whatsoever” he continued.At press time visitors to TJMaxx.com could also browse a seasonal Halloween section that featured a jack-o-lantern cookie jar with a visible seven-inch crack an arctic camo chain wallet and loose pieces from a magnetic travel checkerboard.
2017-08-25T13:09:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/struggling-amtrak-to-discontinue-mysterious-late-night-1819580227,Struggling Amtrak To Discontinue Mysterious Late-Night Trains To Spirit Realm,WASHINGTON—In response to a decline in revenue from routes running between the two disparate planes of existence Amtrak announced Friday that it plans to cancel the mysterious mist-enshrouded trains offering late-night service into the darkest realms of the spirit.The trains which according to Amtrak timetables leave once daily at the stroke of midnight their headlamps cutting through thick tendrils of billowing fog as they travel nonstop to points along their accursed route will cease all operations September 1 as part of an effort to better allocate resources.“The cost-cutting measures we’ve introduced today include the termination of service to all stops between Amtrak terminals and the domain of shadows that drives men to complete and utter madness” CEO Charles Moorman told reporters during a press conference. “The fuel required for these long journeys to ominous and inexplicable destinations within the spirit realm greatly increases our operating costs as does the need to staff each car with the ghosts of our passenger’s deceased relatives.”“Service will continue through the end of the month” he added. “At that point any pained restless mortals unable to find a moment of solace since the horrible accident on the eve of their wedding will have to make other travel arrangements.”“The cost-cutting measures include the termination of service to all stops between Amtrak terminals and the domain of shadows that drives men to complete and utter madness.”According to financial records the Hereafter Regional Line which originates in a faint hazy glow in the distance and makes stops along the void bridging the worlds of the living and the dead has been operating at a loss since the early 2000s. Though its service has been curtailed over the years the train’s stops have been known to include a deserted station at which a faceless man in a frock coat waits to board a perfectly still moonlit lake a manor house in which the motionless silhouette of a young woman can be seen in the only lighted window and a gaping chasm from which one can hear the tortured screams of the damned.Officials confirmed they had been unsuccessful with a recent fiscal plan to rein in expenses by running fewer trains during solstices and on the anniversary of the ill-fated night all those years ago when one’s life went horribly horribly wrong.Compounding the line’s economic woes are its aging 19th-century locomotives which reportedly require constant maintenance in order to continue barreling down the tracks at ever faster speeds while the banshee’s screech of metal upon metal echoes the wails of the accursed souls onboard. Sources added that the track portions of which curve around forgotten graveyards with half-uprooted tombstones or corkscrew straight up into the night sky cannot easily be shared by other Amtrak lines leaving the track largely unused and unprofitable during daylight hours.“These days a lot fewer people are being drawn into an abandoned rail yard by the beguiling whisper of their lost loves only to find themselves emerging into a flickering phantasm of Grand Central Station in the 1940s” said Moorman noting that Amtrak had struggled to shift from a rider base of spectral gangsters and Civil War soldiers reliving their final moments on earth to millennials. “Unfortunately that means this service will no longer be available to customers on their way to meet the hollow-eyed ferryman who if you cross his palm with silver will take you on harrowing journeys that pierce the veil of death but that’s a reality we have to face.”“Often there won’t be a single person waiting on the platform when our conductors shamble off the train and hold their lanterns aloft in long skeletal fingers” he continued. “So clearly our current approach isn’t working.”While Moorman acknowledged that canceling the routes would inconvenience many otherworld commuters he said Amtrak planned to ease the transition by running a shuttle service to and from the land of everlasting torment through November.He went on to state that customers who had exchanged their most cherished memory for a ticket on the now-defunct line would receive full credit for their fond reminiscence and be allowed to apply it to the fare of any other Amtrak route.
2017-08-24T11:58:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/nation-s-therapists-say-majority-of-issues-could-be-res-1819580221,Nation’s Therapists Say Majority Of Issues Could Be Resolved By Not Being So Weird All The Time,WASHINGTON—Saying the method yields positive results almost immediately a coalition of leading therapists said Thursday that most of the personal issues people experience could be resolved if they would simply stop being so weird all the time.On issues ranging from relationship problems and feelings of anxiety to more specific concerns like stress in the workplace and self-consciousness in social situations the mental health experts asserted that not acting weird about every little thing could prove hugely beneficial for millions in many cases eliminating their problems altogether.“Clients come in to talk to me about things in their lives that are making them unhappy and nine times out of 10 they could resolve the issue just by not being such a weirdo” said Dallas-area psychotherapist Jesse DeStefano adding that everyone has a choice whether to go through life as a total freak or not and that those who don’t are healthier and more productive. “The process is very simple. When you start thinking about something weird—at work at home on a date—stop doing that and think about normal things instead. It’s really quite easy.”“Once you start focusing on normal stuff you’ll find the situation improves instantly” he continued.Asked to elaborate on this method DeStefano said it could be broken down into three simple steps: Recognize that most people don’t act the way you do ask yourself what a regular person would do in your situation and then do that. According to the therapist people could save themselves a lot of trouble if they would follow this approach before they open their mouths and start to say something that makes them sound completely wacko.He added that by not being weird it was possible to lead a happier and more fulfilled life noting that everyone will see you as normal person because you will be acting like a normal person.“Look whatever issues you may have your best bet is to get up go outside and stop behaving weirdly” said Eva Perlmutter a clinical psychologist who practices in Boston. “I could talk all day about negative thought patterns social dynamics and interpersonal skills but honestly you’d be better off taking a good look around and observing how the vast majority of other people just act normal. Seriously they’re pretty much all around you.”“I really don’t know what else to tell you” she added. “If you’re having weird thoughts then don’t have them anymore.”She went on to ask why if people have things that are bothering them they would ever think that being all weird about it could possibly help.“Just don’t be a freak especially when you’re around other people” DeStefano said. “Don’t be a freak around your friends your family your coworkers—and certainly don’t be a freak around people you’ve just met. It’s not even a good idea to be a freak in front of your therapist.”“Seriously do you have any idea how weird it is to pay someone to listen to you talk about your problems?” he continued. “That’s probably the weirdest part of all.”
2017-08-04T12:03:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/76-million-baby-boomers-abscond-to-fiji-after-draining-1819580141,76 Million Baby Boomers Abscond To Fiji After Draining Nation’s Social Security, Medicare Accounts,WOODLAWN MD—Arriving en masse to the Pacific island nation after fleeing under the cover of night 76 million baby boomers reportedly escaped to Fiji on Friday after completely draining the nation’s Social Security and Medicare accounts.Sources said the daring $3.1 trillion operation was discovered early this morning as stunned federal employees checked both programs’ reserves only to find that each now held a total of $0.00 the apparent culmination of a plan that reportedly was meticulously organized and executed over the last 30 years.“It’s gone all gone they completely cleaned us out” said Social Security director Nancy Berryhill revealing that airport security cameras had caught every American born between 1946 and 1964 having emptied the U.S. social safety net boarding red-eye flights to Fiji. “These people were using our nation’s wealth as their personal piggy bank for decades just waiting for the right moment to make their move and take us for everything we were worth.”Shocked citizens from around the country were forced to contemplate how they could ever replace the funds they had been counting on for their own healthcare and retirement income.“The way they acted so sweet all these years—how could we not see this coming?” she added. “Those selfish sons of bitches were working us the whole time!”According to sources the entirety of Medicare and Social Security was slowly siphoned off as the post-war generation built trust by assuring the other 240 million Americans that they would collect their share eventually. However since decamping observers say the baby boomers have spent the funds on opulent lifestyles in the tropics where they intend to live out the rest of their days relaxing in comfort all at the expense of the children and grandchildren they reportedly claimed to be concerned about.“We thought they were our friends neighbors and loved ones but clearly they’ve just been enriching their own coffers for years” said Berryhill adding that it was now apparent that despite their “inspirational hot air” about investing in the country’s future the baby boomers only really cared about themselves. “As we speak they’re probably cruising along in their European sports cars to the beachfront condos they bought with our money laughing at how naïve we all were.”“And we fell for their scheme” she continued. “How could we have been so foolish?”As they awoke to find the baby boomers gone shocked citizens from around the country were forced to contemplate how and even if they could ever replace the funds they had been counting on for their own healthcare and retirement income. Speaking to reporters many expressed anger and disbelief that their hard-earned money would be used to pay not for their own basic living expenses but instead for expensive new wardrobes luxury hotel suites and sunset champagne cruises to private Fijian lagoons.“In retrospect it now seems obvious why they were skimming off a little piece of my paycheck every month” said Roland Jensen of Rochester MN noting how his town was left strewn with abandoned homes each containing notes hastily taped to front doors that simply read “Thanks for everything—xoxo.” “They always did think they were better than us that their generation was somehow special. And now those bastards are an ocean away enjoying their perfect tropical paradise while we’re left footing the bill.”“We may never recover after what they did to this country” he added.
2017-07-28T10:24:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/nasa-announces-selection-of-two-hot-ripped-astronauts-1819580114,NASA Announces Selection Of Two Hot, Ripped Astronauts For Man-On-Man Mission To Mars,HOUSTON—After an exhaustive 18-month evaluation process in which an applicant pool of hundreds was narrowed down to the two very buffest candidates NASA announced Friday that it had chosen a pair of hot ripped astronauts to take part in the first-ever man-on-man mission to Mars.Shirtless and oiled-up for their appearance before the press former Air Force captain Stephen Dunhill and Malibu CA lifeguard Blake Brawner were introduced by officials who said the two tanned studs had completed an Astronaut Corps training program that pushed them to their mental physical and carnal limits. NASA confirmed that the two mouthwatering male specimens possessed both the courage and the raw insatiable lust needed to complete the landmark mission.“For centuries humanity has gazed up at the bright red planet in the night sky and dreamed of putting a man on a man on Mars” said NASA acting administrator Robert Lightfoot Jr. explaining that the agency was confident the two hard-bodied astronauts could endure the harsh conditions and constant thrusting the six-year roundtrip mission will require. “As they explore the planet and each other’s chiseled bodies during this mission these two slabs of prime beefcake will advance our understanding of the universe and bring us one step closer to the day when humans build a civilization on another planet and then fuck each other hard.”“These brave horny muscleboys will be true pioneers” Lightfoot added.Having received more than 800 résumés and modeling portfolios officials said they invited the 25 hunkiest applicants to the Johnson Space Center for medical exams to confirm they met stringent requirements for height weight visual acuity testosterone levels and pectoral circumference. Those candidates certified as sufficiently Adonis-like and hungry for cock then reportedly participated in a flight simulation inside a replica of NASA’s new Penetrator spacecraft which has been built for the man-on-man mission’s planned launch in 2020.According to sources the prospective astronauts underwent grueling tests in which they were observed as they piloted the model spacecraft maneuvered through the cramped cabin to check instrument panels while executing seamless reach-arounds responded to simulated emergency scenarios and negotiated the delicate entry into Mars’ atmosphere while having their testicles played with.NASA representatives noted that candidates were also strapped to a gyroscope in the 69 position to evaluate their ability to simultaneously perform and receive oral sex while spinning rapidly along multiple axes.“Throughout the journey from launch to landing we’ll be following the Penetrator’s progress along its charted course and monitoring the crew’s vital signs including their libido level and recovery time between spectacular climaxes” said Lightfoot adding that Mission Control will know immediately if for example the men’s advanced blowjob techniques do not function as anticipated in a zero-gravity environment. “Once on Mars the astronauts will set up their habitation module and fix any mechanical issues with its oxygen generator fuck swing or water purifier.”The acting head of NASA went on to detail other preparations for the mission such as making sure the ship’s payload contained adequate supplies of the calorie-rich foods formulated to quickly re-energize the men after each round of vigorous mind-blowing sex. On the planet’s surface the astronauts will reportedly conduct scientific tests collect soil samples and once they are sealed safely back inside the airlock rip each other’s spacesuits off so they can immediately resume sucking and fucking.Lightfoot praised the two luscious pieces of top-shelf manflesh who stood beside him at the press conference observing that Dunhill a decorated pilot skilled engineer and fellatio expert with steely blue eyes and six-pack abs and Brawner a part-time personal trainer with a chiseled jawline and a 10-inch penis passed the training program “with flying colors.”“Soon mankind will embark upon a new frontier one that many of us have waited for our whole lives” Lightfoot said. “For those of you who want to follow the progress of our astronauts during their historic journey please note that a continuous POV live feed will be available on NASA’s website.”
2017-07-27T14:26:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/amazon-completes-new-suspension-tank-to-house-psychic-b-1819580110,Amazon Completes New Suspension Tank To House Psychic Beings Who Foresee Customers’ Future Orders,SEATTLE—Explaining that the larger containment center was necessary to keep up with increased demand Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced Thursday the completion of a new suspension tank that will allow the online retailer to house even more of the psychic beings who foresee each shopper’s future orders.The glass-walled vat reportedly takes up five stories of a building in Amazon’s downtown Seattle campus and holds 750000 gallons of the psychoactive nutrient fluid necessary to sustain the 256 pale hairless humanoids who every day predict the online purchases of millions of consumers across the world.“This facility will allow us to double our population of clairvoyants which means we will receive more prophecies of orders we can then ship to people who don’t even know they want them yet” said Bezos noting that the completely silent temperature-controlled tank will keep the beings comfortable and focused as they foretell 10000 individualized orders for razor blade cartridges per second. “Whether by divining the exact hiking boots your dad wants for his birthday or envisioning which of 20000 different earbuds is right for you one of our seers will send you the correct product days before you would have even thought to buy it.”“This expanded capacity means every single person with an Amazon account will now begin to receive orders they are not yet conscious of wishing to place” Bezos added.According to the CEO the empaths who float motionlessly in their reservoir have no consciousness outside the temporal retail continuum. He explained that because no one empath can focus on the entirety of Amazon’s product offerings they must specialize with the psychic beings occupying separate sectors of the suspension tank specifically dedicated to areas such as books electronics pet supplies Prime customers gift-card balances or Kindle downloads.Amazon representatives confirmed that the ageless translucent-skinned clairvoyants are clustered in groups of eight throughout the tank and lie supine in radial patterns. They said that upon receiving a product vision a being’s eyes will widen and in a soft monotone it might say for example “Charmin Ultra Soft Mega Roll.” It will then reportedly be answered by a flutter of voices all around it—“Product number 5000477488831” “24 count” “Guaranteed delivery date: Aug. 1 2017” “No gift receipt” “Estimated tax to be collected: $2.52”—while the fluid in the tank pulsates rapidly in fluorescent colors.“Within a fraction of a second after a patio-and-garden clairvoyant has received a premonition it will search through thousands of different wind chimes bird feeders or bug zappers to locate it” said Bezos noting that orders available exclusively from third-party vendors might take a seer slightly longer to foretell. “Once the items have been vocalized they go into the customer’s shopping cart inventory data is updated and the order is processed before the customer has any notion that somewhere deep within the inner reaches of their subconscious they nurture a desire to order these exact items.”“Then their credit card is charged” Bezos continued.According to company sources construction on the new upgraded suspension tank was expedited to ensure completion well before the 2017 holiday shopping season as the number of last-minute gift orders placed last December overtaxed the psychic beings’ temporal lobes damaging their precognitive functions. The problem is said to have gone unnoticed until employees discovered an unusual number of gift-wrapped lawn chairs being sent to addresses all over the world each containing a gift message printed with random words from a dozen or more languages.Amazon lab technicians told reporters that on Dec. 23 they found the clairvoyants thrashing about in their tank and screaming out strings of order confirmation numbers that didn’t even exist. The liquid in their neural bath had grown dangerously thin almost completely depleted of nutrients and it reportedly took weeks to bring them back online.While most customers have hailed the convenience and speed of Amazon’s ordering psychics some shoppers—wary of the intrusiveness of preconscious buying—have expressed skepticism.“I just don’t know if I like these big corporations having my personal data before I even have it” Chicago resident Willard Moser said. “It’s definitely creepy and I’m sure there’s a million ways this could be abused.” “Then again” added Moser. “This new food processor they sent me is amazing.”
2017-07-19T11:43:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/historians-find-evidence-of-nation-s-founding-lobbyists-1819580085,Historians Find Evidence Of Nation’s Founding Lobbyists’ Campaign To Influence Constitution,WASHINGTON—Drawing on a trove of letters diaries and itemized receipts recently donated by private collectors historians from Georgetown University published new evidence on Wednesday of the Founding Lobbyists’ intense behind-the-scenes campaign to influence the U.S. Constitution.The documents reveal a concerted effort by America’s earliest corporate power brokers to curry favor with the Constitution’s framers during the 1787 Constitutional Convention all the way through the ratification of the Bill of Rights in 1791 with delegates having been pampered with gifts such as expensive pocket watches casks of fine Caribbean molasses and extravagant quail-hunting trips to the Province of Massachusetts Bay.“It’s now becoming clear just how much the final language of the Constitution was shaped by say complimentary jugs of quality mead or all-expenses-paid gambling jaunts aboard company-owned schooners.”“What we’ve learned is that these men—acting on behalf of cotton barrel and livestock interests among many others—played a pivotal role in crafting the Constitution as we know it” said professor J. Wilson Adler noting that for example the Third Amendment barring the nonconsensual quartering of soldiers was only added after James Madison was treated to a feast of succulent brisket and stewed pumpkin care of the powerful boardinghouse industry. “For all the Founding Fathers’ brilliance and vision it’s now becoming clear just how much the final language of the Constitution was shaped by say complimentary jugs of quality mead or all-expenses-paid gambling jaunts aboard company-owned schooners.”“These lobbyists knew full well that if you wanted first-rate treatment for your patrons in Providence or Charleston you made sure that gilded ivory walking canes found their way to the delegates gathered in Philadelphia” he added.Evidence also suggests that the original lobbyists were skilled in dampening opposition to their clients’ agendas. Recovered ledgers revealed that an early attempt at universal healthcare—via a welfare clause in Article IV—was voted down after an advocate for the Apothecaries Guild procured front-row duel tickets for the entire Pennsylvania delegation.According to witness accounts of the time the Constitution’s authors were regularly spotted in the colonies’ most exclusive taverns where a different member of the wax or beaver pelt lobbies would cover their exorbitant three-figure tabs and lavish them with exquisite silk garments and spices from beyond the Orient. Preserved woodcuts depict a number of Founding Fathers relaxing on the palm-lined beaches of Hispaniola as they and their families enjoyed luxury accommodations courtesy of the sugarcane industry.In addition personal letters from Thomas Paine and John Adams credit the introduction of the Second Amendment to representatives of the Musket Manufacturers Association which funded a series of vicious attack broadsheets targeting anyone who spoke out against it accusing critics of being tyrannical monarchists who harbored a secret plot to seize the colonies’ flintlocks.“Of course the grandiose spending and backroom deals at the Constitutional Convention did lead to some scandals like Benjamin Franklin being arrested in a courtesan house with a saddlebag of pure snuff that had been provided by tobacco growers” said Adler adding that there was also widespread public outcry following revelations that the Slave Traders of America had donated “1500 prize hogs and 250 stout men of West African stock” to certain delegates in exchange for an abolition amendment being dropped. “Despite these unseemly episodes Founding Fathers like William Livingston and Gouverneur Morris actually went on to become Founding Lobbyists themselves using their insider knowledge to command thousands of gold guineas from the blacksmith and whale oil industries.”“Indeed so much of our nation’s identity can be traced back to this small group of well-connected lobbyists” he continued. “Their signatures may not be on the document but they left a legacy that remains with us to this very day.”
2017-07-13T10:37:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/god-falling-under-influence-of-powerful-spiritual-guru-1819580081,God Falling Under Influence Of Powerful Spiritual Guru,‘He’ll Do Anything The Rishi Tells Him’ Say Concerned Heavenly SourcesTHE HEAVENS—Increasingly worried by the changes they have noticed in the supreme deity’s behavior heavenly sources expressed concern Thursday that God Our Holy Father was falling under the influence of a self-styled spiritual guru calling himself “the Rishi.”The charismatic middle-aged man who began counseling God on a regular basis after the divine Creator attended one of his free transcendental meditation seminars last September has reportedly had a profound effect on the Lord’s beliefs lifestyle and even His diet leading members of the angelic community to fear the Almighty may no longer be capable of making decisions without the Rishi’s guidance.“At first it seemed like just some harmless self-exploration which was fine until God started quoting the Rishi all the time and mentioning out of nowhere how the Rishi had opened His eyes to the truth” said the archangel Jophiel adding that God now seems to always carry a copy of the Rishi’s self-published book Astral Wisdom with Him wherever He goes. “It’s all Rishi this Rishi that. This guy’s got God chanting these inane mantras for hours on end and now whenever you see Him around Heaven the Rishi’s right there at His side whispering another one of his ‘teachings’ to the Lord.” Reports indicate that the Rishi who wears a designer watch and claims the ability to interpret dreams has even begun performing some of God’s heavenly tasks himself.“God used to be this enormously warm and gregarious presence but ever since He met this guy He’s been cutting out everyone He says is dampening His ‘chi force’” Jophiel continued. “I don’t think He’s spoken to His son in weeks.”According to Jophiel God now routinely references passages from the Rishi’s 16-point “Enlightened Living Philosophy” a document that was supposedly revealed to the 53-year-old in a waking dream in 1998. Since discovering the mystical figure’s ideology sources said God has started wearing a pouch of crystals around His neck shaved His hair and beard and purchased levels 1 and 2 of the Rishi’s “Rebuilding Consciousness” program.In addition reports indicate that the Rishi who wears a designer watch and claims the ability to interpret dreams has even begun performing some of God’s heavenly tasks himself so the deity can devote more time to His daily karmic breathing practices.“The Rishi makes all of us pretty uncomfortable but whenever anyone speaks up about him God just casts them out of His kingdom so I’ve learned to keep my mouth shut” said the archangel Azrael who acknowledged that he and several seraphim briefly considered holding an intervention for the Almighty after observing the Rishi coaxing Him into a particularly strenuous and unnatural-looking yoga position earlier this year. “Besides what’s the point of making a big stink when the Rishi has the Lord convinced that the archangels are all negative influences and that we just can’t see the ‘Oneness Path’ like He can.”While details of the Rishi’s past remain unknown heavenly sources confirmed that the guru owns at least three residences including a sprawling 200-acre property he refers to as his “retreat and wellness center.” On various occasions the Rishi has reportedly suggested that God take His spiritual commitment to the next level by coming to live with him.“Apparently as part of God’s spiritual training the Rishi told Him that He must spread the message of what He’s learned to others so He’s always handing out copies of the Rishi’s writings whether anyone wants them or not” said Jophiel noting that he had personally received and thrown away more than a dozen leaflets in just the past few months. “I took a look at one and it made no sense at all—something about the triangulation of chakras and the essential brain-body connection. Plus it was all misspelled and aligned kind of crooked like it had been printed off a home printer.”“I just hope He comes to His senses soon because this is starting to get really worrying” the archangel added. “I don’t want to see God wasting His eternal life on some bullshit made-up religion.”
2017-06-29T09:29:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/theoretical-scientists-gather-for-35th-annual-symposium-1819580051,Theoretical Scientists Gather For 35th Annual Symposium To Try To Determine How Gas Nozzle Knows When Tank Is Full,PASADENA CA—In hopes of better understanding a phenomenon that has vexed researchers for decades hundreds of theoretical scientists have assembled at the California Institute of Technology for the 35th annual symposium on how gas nozzles know when a car’s tank is full sources said Thursday.The weeklong academic conference which draws top experts in quantum physics pure mathematics systems theory and numerous other scientific fields will feature a variety of interdisciplinary panel discussions and collaborative workshop sessions as well as dozens of presentations from theorists sharing their ideas about what kind of mechanism could possibly enable a gasoline pump to turn itself off at just the right moment and avoid spilling fuel all over the place.“All we know for certain is that you leave the nozzle in there for a while it makes this little popping sound and then your tank is full. Maybe this is the year we finally figure out why.”“We’re particularly excited this year because a team of computational chemists from Poland may have finally cracked the so-called Half-Full Paradox which has long stumped scientists who have sought to understand how the pump knows when to stop fueling regardless of whether your tank is empty or still has some gas left in it” said symposium chair professor Marian Reardon explaining that early scientists who tackled this problem once believed nozzles operated on a timer but later realized this theory failed to account for tanks that remained partially filled. “We’ll also discuss the pump’s apparent ability to tell whether you’re driving a compact car or a large truck and adjust the volume it dispenses to match the tank size a complex and puzzling question that no one has yet been able to put forth a convincing theory to explain.”“All we know for certain is that you leave the nozzle in there for a while it makes this little popping sound and then your tank is full” Reardon continued. “Maybe this is the year we finally figure out why.”According to symposium organizers the week will feature a half-day seminar on whether a small camera inside the car’s tank allows gas station attendants to see when it’s time to shut off the pump; a presentation titled “Smart Pumps: Could Computer Chips In Gas Nozzles Recognize The Make And Model Of Every Car?”; and an eagerly anticipated keynote speech from professor Sunita Chowdry a theoretical physicist who has spent the past two years in residence at a Pump ’N’ Munch filling station in eastern Minnesota.The conference is also scheduled to include several breakout sessions that will explore how microscopic sensors might be embedded within the nozzle and whether a gas tank’s location on either the driver’s side or passenger’s side provides crucial information to the pump about how much fuel to transfer.Although many in attendance expressed excitement about a new National Science Foundation program aimed at identifying promising researchers and providing them with tens of millions of dollars in gas money grants to conduct on-site fieldwork—a potentially game-changing source of funding—skeptical sources said they remained wary that any groundbreaking advancements would be made in the near term after having been so frequently disappointed in the past.“I was here in ’92 when [Oxford mathematician Emil] Bantikov presented his equation that purported to explain why you can still get a few more squeezes of gas into the tank even after the nozzle shuts off” said professor David Werner co-chair of the quantum mechanics program at Carnegie Mellon. “For years he had locked himself away in his lab working on his ‘Extra Splash Theorem’ until late one night he emerged overjoyed with what he thought was a revolutionary discovery. But his formula was quickly disproven he was shunned from the nozzle community and his reputation never recovered.”“So let’s just say I’m not holding my breath for any new breakthroughs” Werner added.Still attendees said the mood at the conference remained generally upbeat with participants praising a main-stage presentation that examined whether gas stations keep their seemingly unlimited gasoline supply in the awning above the pumps in the room at the back of the building marked “employees only” or someplace else entirely. They also reportedly engaged in lively debate during a roundtable discussion about how the little screen on the pump is able to count the gallons of fuel it is dispensing so rapidly and precisely often to the third decimal place.Despite this enthusiasm few of those present appeared to harbor any illusions that the nozzle-shutoff problem would be fully understood for decades or even centuries to come.“Think about what an incredible and astonishing phenomenon this is: Even if you try to trick the pump after it has finished by removing and then reinserting the nozzle into your gas tank it will still click itself off when you start pumping again” said professor Jonathan Lam a pioneering researcher in the field who is widely admired for a seminal 1993 paper positing that the area beside each fuel pump contains an in-ground scale that weighs every automobile and thereby detects how much gas is required to refill the tank. “No matter what you do the pump simply won’t let you overfill your tank. Maybe it uses artificial intelligence maybe satellites maybe lasers maybe something we haven’t yet conceived of. But getting back into the car turning it on and seeing that needle go right back up to ‘F’—it always reminds me how miraculous it is that the pump dispenses the exact right amount of gas every time.” “It’s unlikely we’ll have an explanation in my lifetime” Lam added. “But I feel honored to know I’ve played some small part in laying the groundwork for the generation that one day will find the answer.”

If I really dig I know I can find a chalice that’ll transubstantiate wine into the blood of Christ pretty much as well as the real thing.”“And even if the stem snaps or the jewels come unglued I’m only out a few bucks” he added. “I can just get another.”“I love coming down here every now and then to explore and maybe pick up a few things if I happen upon a good price.”In addition to retail the Vatican Chinatown is reportedly home to dozens of storefronts touting alternative sacramental services such as herbal baptisms or reflexology treatments for the sick and dying often demonstrated on small televisions playing looped video of priests performing the rites. Behind the shops that line Via Pio X and Via di Porta Angelica penitents can also descend into one of the area’s basement confessional parlors and be absolved of their sins at a cost of three for $5 or seven for 10.However due to the quasi-legal nature of some merchants’ business practices the area is regularly patrolled by members of the Swiss Guard on the lookout for scams. Pope Francis himself has reportedly witnessed sellers hawking what they claimed were the bones of saints or patches of the Shroud of Turin but who then quickly rolled up their blankets and scattered as soon as they caught sight of the guards.“You do have to be careful—one time I bought a Latin Vulgate Bible but when I got home I realized it just cut off right in the middle of Leviticus” said the pontiff glancing at himself in a mirror wearing the visored miter he was considering purchasing. “When I tried to take it back the lady screamed at me ‘All sales final!’ What am I going to do get into a whole thing with her?”Added the Vicar of Christ “Oh well lesson learned.”As he walked under an ornate Paifang into another winding alleyway of awnings Pope Francis reportedly stopped at the open-air shop where he buys whole fish in bulk during Lent. Afterward witnesses said the pontiff bought a mango bubble tea and partook in some window-shopping at various stores selling Ray-Ban sunglasses swords supposedly used by Templar Knights during the 12th-century crusades and unlocked smartphones.“Cardinal Giuseppe told me about this great karaoke place down on Sant’Anna near the Vatican Library that has a huge selection of all the best hymns” Pope Francis said as he passed by a dim sum stall posting a small menu in both Chinese and rudimentary liturgical Latin. “I think it’s the perfect spot for our midnight Mass afterparty when all the visiting bishops are in town this December. Boy I’m really going to have to practice my ‘Ave Maria’ before then.”“It’s so nice to have some things around here that are open on Christmas” he added.At press time several vendors were aggressively waving the pope into their shops with the promise of name-brand ecclesiastical vestments at 75 percent off retail price.
2017-06-07T11:00:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/nasa-receives-more-depressing-photos-of-mars-surface-f-1819579998,NASA Receives More Depressing Photos Of Mars’ Surface From Morbid Curiosity Rover,PASADENA CA—In the latest troubling update from the multi-year survey mission scientists at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory received another set of depressing photos from the martian surface taken by the Morbid Curiosity Rover sources at the agency confirmed Wednesday.The Morbid Curiosity Rover an all-black semi-autonomous robot launched from Cape Canaveral in 2013 was intended to provide a range of geological and environmental data about the red planet. However after years of pretentiously dreary and self-pitying uplinks from the vehicle scientists say they now dread even having to look at each new message it transmits the 33.9 million miles back to Earth.“The latest images from Morbid Curiosity are more of what we’ve come to expect at this point—photos of the night sky framed to block out any stars sullen self-portraits taken against a backdrop of carbon dioxide ice and lots and lots of dust” said senior engineer Eshan Shah adding that despite having a full-color onboard camera every image the rover has sent back so far has been in stark black and white. “When we designed the mission we thought Morbid Curiosity might help uncover some of the planet’s mysteries. Of course that was before we began receiving 6-terabyte data dumps of just the word ‘bleak’ repeated hundreds of billions of times.”“Frankly it’s testing the patience of everyone on this project” Shah added.NASA sources said they noticed early on that there seemed to be something wrong with Morbid Curiosity when the rover showed little interest in engaging in any of its programmed research activities preferring instead to maneuver aimlessly around the surface with its primary camera fixed toward the ground.The research team had initially hoped that the rover which reportedly wears studded leather cuffs on each of its axles was simply going through a phase. However scientists said that during its years on Mars Morbid Curiosity has only sunk deeper into a petulant exasperating rut sticking to its own lonely corner of the northern hemisphere as far away from other rovers as possible.“Most days it takes several hours of back-and-forth just to coax it out of the crater it’s rolled into before we can get a basic barometric reading” said engineer Miranda Pollack adding that the rover typically abandons its assigned tasks at the first sign of adversity often breaking off to trace pictures of coffins in the martian soil with its excavator tool. “We’ve tried motivating it to take more of an interest in its surroundings but it always comes back with some excuse about how it’s out of energy even though we can clearly see its radioisotope power source is working just fine.”“I think in its entire three years on the planet it’s only moved about 600 meters” Pollack added.On several occasions Morbid Curiosity’s depressive behavior has caused NASA to worry about its well-being and safety. In one instance the rover reportedly cut off all contact with mission control and refused to respond to commands for weeks despite telemetric data indicating that it was still receiving researchers’ transmissions. When the rover finally reestablished contact it did so by sending back disturbing photos of crosshatch scars it had made on its robotic arm using its own laser cutting module.Although NASA staff theorize the incident was likely a plea for attention researchers say Morbid Curiosity’s repeated vague threats to harm itself have made them even warier of working with the rover.“A couple months ago it sent us a massive file titled ‘despair’ and honestly I’ve just been avoiding opening it” said assistant director Alicia Herritz adding that researchers have also taken to ignoring Morbid Curiosity’s hourly temperature readings which regularly report the rover to be at absolute zero even though the surrounding martian atmosphere is 220 degrees Celsius warmer. “I actually felt kind of relieved when it looked like it had suffered a terminal malfunction last fall but it turned out it had just gotten the purple lace choker on its mast camera stuck on a rock outcrop. I mean is it really going to keep acting like this for the rest of its 15-year operational lifespan?”At press time the Morbid Curiosity rover was reportedly ignoring operators’ frantic pleas to back away from the 16000-foot cliff of the Valles Marineris canyon.
2017-06-01T10:01:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/nation-unable-to-discern-why-unattractive-woman-on-scre-1819579969,Nation Unable To Discern Why Unattractive Woman On Screen,‘Maybe She’ll Be Attractive Later’ Say CitizensWASHINGTON—Expressing profound confusion and distress at what they were witnessing the U.S. populace was unable to discern why an unattractive woman was suddenly on screen in front of them sources reported Thursday.Americans across the country said they struggled to comprehend what was happening when with no warning at all the woman who was not conventionally attractive appeared on screen and remained there. Astonished citizens told reporters that despite carefully scrutinizing the woman they could find nothing whatsoever alluring about her and could only speculate that she might very soon receive a makeover or even radical plastic surgery to become attractive.“I was just watching TV and all of a sudden it was like ‘Wait what? Who is this? Why is this happening?’” said 34-year-old financial planner Frank Ramos who was among the millions of Americans who believed there might be something wrong with their televisions when the woman first appeared. “Maybe she’s got some sort of illness and will be pretty once she recovers from it? Oh I bet she’s a beautiful woman in disguise. She’s probably going to take off her wig and put on a sexy dress in a minute.”“Huh weird” continued Ramos. “She’s still there.”Many dumbfounded Americans wondered if the unattractive woman was on screen as part of an attractive character’s dream sequence while others thought they were watching a flashback to when the woman had been unattractive and that she would be good-looking as soon as that scene ended. Some citizens posited that the unattractive woman was an alien in a science-fiction show and that’s why she was not attractive.Reports indicate that Americans furrowed their brows and looked around blankly before suggesting that perhaps the unattractive woman was supposed to be funny.“Oh my god now she’s talking” said 52-year-old sales associate Jade Fletcher who along with Americans in every state squinted and leaned in close to the television in confusion. “Am I supposed to be paying attention to what she’s saying? What the hell is going on? The woman she’s talking to isn’t attractive either. Is this a prank? Like a prank show?”“Why is she still saying things?” continued Fletcher. “I hate her.”A poll of U.S. citizens found that when asked about the woman 47 percent said that they must be watching a disturbing documentary 31 percent concluded that the woman was a casual acquaintance of the attractive main character who would leave forever after a mercifully brief interaction and 22 percent simply stammered scratched their heads and admitted that they could not possibly answer the question.Reports indicate that tens of millions of Americans then stared at the tree next to the unattractive woman for several seconds determining that it was likely the focus of the scene in the first place.According to sources Americans were relieved when the unattractive woman went off screen for a few seconds but they were completely dumbstruck when she returned without even bringing a more attractive person with her prompting many to express even deeper bewilderment when they regained their powers of speech.“Maybe she’s going to get killed” said 29-year-old programmer Evan Cornish visibly brightening upon possibly having discovered the reason for the unattractive woman’s continued presence. “Yeah I think I understand now. She’s going to be murdered because that’s somehow part of the attractive woman’s character development—she does have a purpose after all.”“I just hope she dies soon” Cornish continued.At press time Americans had turned their televisions off and thrown their remotes across the room in frustration after a different woman came on screen who was clearly not in her 20s.
2017-05-26T09:06:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/president-trump-has-enacted-the-theseus-protocol-wha-1819579965,President Trump Has Enacted The ‘Theseus Protocol’: What Does That Mean For America?,The documents referred to in this editorial are part of a trove of classified files provided to The Onion by an anonymous whistleblower in the White House. All of these documents can be found here.While there is much to find concerning in the collection of White House files that The Onion has obtained—from the president’s struggles to comprehend the intelligence information provided to him to the White House staff’s ineptitude at operating the West Wing rune portal to the extremely thorough presentation the president received from the Fish and Wildlife Service on his first full day in office to familiarize him with all of the nation’s fish—no documents are more unnerving than those pertaining to a shadowy secret program known as the Theseus Protocol.What is the Theseus Protocol? What does it aim to achieve? And how will it affect the citizens of this country? Even after reading through these documents multiple times our analysts are still struggling to piece together answers to these questions given the spectacular complexity and opacity of this unusual initiative. Among the few things we can report with a sufficient level of certainty is that enacting the Theseus Protocol appears to be the president’s foremost priority as evidenced by his signing of a secret executive order on February 17 titled “Authorization to Enact the Theseus Protocol Bringing About the Ninth Conjunction of Spheres and Shattering of the Crimson Veil.” While the executive order speaks cryptically of “enact[ing] the Smoldering-to-Come” and opening the “Ancient Door of m-Am-uuthua” its ultimate objective aside from a mysterious reference to “bring[ing] forth the reign everlasting and undying of the Many-Instanced One” remains unclear.More context however can be gleaned from the writings of an obscure figure known only as “The Director” who despite having never been mentioned publicly by any member of the administration and going entirely unacknowledged in all official White House personnel records appears to coordinate directly with top-level administration officials and maintain an office in the lowest sub-basement of the White House. Indeed The Director issued a memo in March alerting administration officials and “all who dwell in or below the realms of the earth” that his massive tunneling operation underneath the White House was drawing “ever closer to the buried city of Nul’Kek” and that it was only a matter of time before the Many-Instanced One was “born anew unto this world in living flesh.”Furthermore The Director seems to maintain frequent contact with President Trump himself having written a series of foreboding letters urging the commander in chief to complete the Theseus Protocol so that the pair may reign forever in “an eternity of dark bliss.”Much like our own publication’s reporters most West Wing staffers appear to have little understanding of the Theseus Protocol or any of the numerous steps involved in bringing it into being. Indeed most White House email conversations pertaining to the Theseus Protocol consist entirely of baffled administration employees attempting to make sense of the Blood Purity Council they were charged with establishing the preparations they were putting in place for the Grand Immolation the bitterly cold winds that persistently blow throughout the West Wing and the numerous other bizarre circumstances and complicated tasks they were enduring in an effort to bring about the “dissolution of the Veil of Crimson.”Despite assigning every inmate in The Onion’s vast private prison network to the task of poring through these documents the question of what the Theseus Protocol is and how it will affect the American people remains unsatisfyingly and ominously unresolved. In fact the limited information in our possession has only led us to ask deeper darker and much more harrowing questions such as: What will happen when the sheaths that protect our mortal realm from That Which Lies In The Beyond are penetrated? What are the 99 names and 77 titles of the Many-Instanced One that shall not be uttered? Will the Eastern Seaboard be incinerated instantaneously or over a period of time? What exactly is a “flesh shroud”? Will all of us be immolated or will some of us be pulled away to serve as additional concubines for the gebbeths? And will the government follow through on its pledge to “suspend all laws—federal state local and metaphysical—for the duration of the Theseus Protocol and by extension the current iteration of this universe”?Unfortunately it appears we may never receive adequate answers to these questions. What is certain however is that all of our lives and indeed the very fate of our dimension now rest with the decision-making abilities of President Donald J. Trump.

In addition sources said patrons can acquire a prepaid David & Benedict’s platinum-preferred Power Card that will allow them to play games at the venue and in a crossover promotion with Emirates Airlines purchase luxury amenities when flying first-class to Dubai.“There’s nothing quite like meeting up at David & Benedict’s with a bunch of buddies from your hedge fund and digging into some caramelized foie-gras-and-nacho-cheese poppers” Feng said. “After you’ve enjoyed a couple of our signature Wildberry Burst cocktails made from 50-year-old single-malt scotch you’ll want to head on over to the custom-built Dance Dance Revolution game station which was developed using data from motion-capture suits worn by the company of the Bolshoi Ballet.”“Particularly adept guests will be able to dance the entirety of both the black and the white swan leads for the entire two-hour-and-25-minute run of Swan Lake” she added.Industry analysts said they expect David & Benedict’s to face stiff competition from rivals with Chuck E. Cheese’s having recently opened a lavish venue called Charles Ellsworth Cheddarton’s which features its beloved animal characters in a 100-piece animatronic symphony orchestra that performs the works of Wagner Mozart and Stravinsky.
2017-05-25T14:34:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/the-onion-invites-republican-candidate-greg-gianforte-1819579958,‘The Onion’ Invites Republican Candidate Greg Gianforte To Physically Assault Our Entire Editorial Staff,Given the important policies they oversee and the highly public nature of their work it is to be expected that our government officials will at times come into conflict with the press especially amid the tense political circumstances in which we now find ourselves. And it is not unusual for these tensions to reach an explosive flash point as they did last night in Montana when Republican congressional candidate Greg Gianforte attacked a reporter from The Guardian for asking what was a shamefully antagonistic and prying question regarding the Republicans’ proposed healthcare bill.In light of these events our editorial board would like to state our unwavering support of Mr. Gianforte and invite him to physically assault every member of The Onion’s news staff.It has always been the belief of this storied publication that elected officials and the press have important roles to play in our democracy: namely that the former sets the policies that guide our nation and the latter subserviently provides a mouthpiece to trumpet the will and intentions of the ruling class without question and without complaint. We here at The Onion are fully aware that our own reporters like all members of the power-mad out-of-control media frequently overstep these sacred boundaries by scrutinizing the decisions and actions that those in mighty seats of authority such as Mr. Gianforte do not wish to discuss. And in such instances it is important—imperative even—that those who hold the reins of power put us in our place and punish us preferably with considerable physical force so that we never again commit such improper transgressions.If any of our journalists have ever made Mr. Gianforte feel threatened in any way at all whether by holding a recorder too close to his face writing a story that did not paint him in a positive light or disrespectfully seeking clarification on a point he or his party might have made we encourage him to use his fists knees elbows or a blunt object of his choice to make it known through repeated physical blows how we have upset him.To demonstrate our publication’s commitment to the solemn mission of maintaining the press’s proper subservience to the privileged and powerful we invite—indeed we encourage—Mr. Gianforte to visit The Onion’s headquarters at his convenience. Upon entering our offices he will promptly be directed to the rows of desks where our editorial staff produce their reportage so that he may assault each and every one of us for as long as he deems necessary.Furthermore The Onion would like to make it clear to Mr. Gianforte—as well as all other politicians who serve at all levels of government—that if at any time in the future you are ever asked a question by a member of our staff that you find unfair intrusive disparaging or that simply makes you feel uncomfortable please immediately channel all of your strength into shoving this individual out of your presence preferably knocking them to the ground or against the wall so that they may understand their error. And if one of our reporters ever attempts to record an interaction that you do not wish to have documented The Onion kindly suggests that you grab the camera or tape recorder from the journalist’s hands and throw it back into their chest or against a nearby wall as vigorously as you are capable of.To further clarify just how he may treat our journalists we ask that Mr. Gianforte refer to the following list of attacks that we have approved for his use either individually or in combination against any member of The Onion staff:SlapKickPunch to facePunch to abdomenPunch to back of headThrow to groundChokeholdHit with heavy objectThroat stompGrab by hair and smash face into tabletopSuplexWhile not a physically injurious attack it should be noted that Mr. Gianforte is additionally allowed to spit on us.The Onion believes strongly in the deferential role that the press must play in American democracy and last night’s event in Montana was just the latest positive episode in the elegant dance between journalism and power that has gone on since this country’s founding. Without the vigilance and threats of physical violence from brave men and women like Mr. Gianforte the press would surely become too brazen and powerful.Mr. Gianforte we hope that you accept our apology on behalf of the disgusting disrespectful Guardian journalist who asked you that reprehensible question yesterday and please know that we have readied a selection of heavy wooden bats for your use here in our offices and we eagerly await your reply.
2017-05-25T11:11:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/just-who-are-the-trumps-exactly-1819579955,Just Who Are The Trumps, Exactly?,The documents referred to in this editorial are part of a trove of classified files provided to The Onion by an anonymous whistleblower in the White House. All of these documents can be found here.While Donald Trump has courted the media spotlight for more than four decades his wife and children have maintained notably lower profiles. And although The Onion’s legion of journalists embedded deep inside the luxury neckwear industry have attempted to gain access to the Trump family for years none of these efforts have provided as much insight into the private lives of these captivating individuals as have the emails letters and other materials contained within the trove of White House documents this publication has obtained. Now at last The Onion can reveal the driving passions the inner struggles and the spiraling death counts lurking behind the glossy exterior of one of America’s most prosperous and powerful families.Of all of the Trump children Ivanka maintains the closest ties to the commander in chief given her role as an assistant to the president and her marriage to White House Senior Advisor Jared Kushner. In fact she seems to look after the president with an almost maternal level of care having developed a comprehensive set of instructions for properly feeding him calming him down and keeping him from hurting himself which she has shared with White House staffers. She also appears to be the most strong-willed and independent-minded of the young Trumps as she revealed at the state dinner for Chinese Premier Xi Jinping on April 6 when she stubbornly refused the night’s specially prepared meal explaining that she was “on a strict aroma-based diet and [would] provide her own lavender sage and sandalwood-infused handkerchiefs.” However numerous conflict-of-interest concerns continue to swirl around the 35-year-old as she has maintained a managerial position in her fashion line while in office a fact that was clearly demonstrated in a series of emails between her and her Indonesian garment factory manager who informed her of several fatal workplace accidents that were delaying the production of her label’s latest design.Ivanka’s brothers Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump assumed control of the family business upon their father’s inauguration with both currently serving in executive positions at the Trump Organization. However according to documents obtained by The Onion it is clear that the pair have maintained persistent contact with their father since he took office as indicated for example by the West Wing visitor log for February 10 which revealed that Eric signed in that day to “play in the White House pool.” And while the president had promised to separate himself from the dealings of his namesake business there exist a significant number of emails in which the two Trump sons are clearly seen continuing to run ideas by their father such as the sketches they made of a flying go-kart and a “robot karate master” as well as a script for a film called “Dooms Day Mision [sic]” that they described as “an action movie about 2 business guys who fight robbers at night and ther [sic] dad is the president of the United States!!!”In contrast to the relatively abundant information regarding her older half-siblings there is little in The Onion’s collection of White House documents that pertains to or even mentions Tiffany Trump the president’s only child from his marriage to Marla Maples. According to the few scant pieces of evidence in our files Tiffany is mostly kept at a distance from President Trump as indicated by her February visit to the White House for her “annual 10-minute chat.” It also appears that she is financially removed from the rest of her family based on a $5340 charge from President Trump’s personal accountant for stewardship of the “Trump Family (all but Tiffany) Trust.”Perhaps even more dispiriting than the circumstances surrounding Tiffany are those in which the first lady finds herself. In her numerous handwritten letters home to her family in Slovenia Melania speaks of a suffocating cloak of sadness enveloping her and a biting distaste for most of the workers in her husband’s employ from Stephen Miller and his degenerate lusting after her shoes to Kellyanne Conway’s constant “hissing” and “skulking” to the “rancid scent” that follows Steve Bannon “like a putrid ghoul.” By her own admission Melania is only able to experience a measure of happiness in the company of her chambermaid Annalise whom she has grown quite fond of “despite her lowly social station and frightfully plain countenance.”While the documents acquired by The Onion shed considerable light on the little-known members of the first family our understanding of these enigmatic individuals remains far from complete. Indeed these documents have raised a considerable number of urgent questions. Do enough of Ivanka’s garment factory workers remain alive to complete her fall collection? Will Eric and Donald Jr. ever receive permission to build their desired tree houses on the South Lawn of the White House? And what exactly did Melania see dangling from Steve Bannon’s jaws in the moonlit Rose Garden? The editorial board of America’s Finest News Source offers its solemn pledge to you dear reader that we will install as many of our proprietary Onion-brand wiretaps and abduct and torture as many low-level White House custodial workers as necessary until satisfactory answers to each and every one of these questions are ascertained.

All of these documents can be found here.As soon as Donald Trump won the presidency last November it became clear to every editor journalist and indentured Laotian typesetter at The Onion that we would soon be contending with an unorthodox administration. Now as our employees ceaselessly analyze a vast trove of classified White House documents on ocean barges floating outside the jurisdiction of the Fair Labor Standards Act we are finding ample evidence that the path being pursued by this president and his cabinet is as anticipated startlingly unlike any other in history. In fact every American should cower in fear at what we have uncovered.While it is evident to even a casual political observer that the Trump administration is determined to reverse numerous Obama-era norms and regulations the precise details of such efforts are particularly shocking. Notably we have obtained evidence that the Department of Homeland Security is moving to reauthorize enhanced interrogation techniques for suspected terrorists illegal immigrants and the White House Press Corps. According to the highly classified material in our possession the federal government plans to circumvent the Geneva Conventions by detaining these individuals within a timeless lightless extra-dimensional realm known as The Void where prisoners can be deprived of sleep for up to 40000 years at a time and forced to watch their families grow old and die across billions of alternate universes.The new administration is also poised to discontinue Obama-era green energy initiatives and return the nation to a greater reliance on fossil fuels which could have dire implications for every citizen of this nation. Specifically Energy Secretary Rick Perry delivered a classified presentation to the president in April addressing the nation’s energy crisis noting forebodingly that “human bodies are made of carbon which can become oil” and that “there are over 320 million sources of oil in the U.S. today.” At present it appears the Energy Department is piloting a “carceral production plan” to tap this new source of fuel as soon as possible.The ecosystem also appears to be at serious risk under this cabinet based on the presentation that Administrator Scott Pruitt delivered to the president in March outlining the Environmental Protection Agency’s objectives and goals for the next four years. Furthermore Pruitt himself confirmed he is actively subverting his own agency’s efforts to protect the environment in a series of updates he sent to the White House regarding the progress he was making in destroying his office with a hammer.It should be noted that the decisions now being made in Washington are not only placing the future of the planet in peril but also the future of our nation’s children. According to The Onion’s analysis the only effort Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has so far made to bolster the public school curriculum was her recommendation to instate a nationwide after-school polo program for underserved students which she claimed would “instill important skills like leadership and field etiquette into these kids that they will need later in life.” Additionally the sole memo she has thus far issued in office was titled “Addressing The Growing Trend Of Students Drawing Dongs In Textbooks” which decried the negative learning conditions that result when children encounter a variety of hand-drawn dongs—from large dongs to curved dongs to dongs with excessive curly black hair—throughout the pages of their course books.While DeVos’ initiatives raise serious and troubling questions perhaps no cabinet member’s behavior is more perplexing than that of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson. According to a strange rambling presentation delivered in February Carson warned the Oval Office that his agency was unable to “translate the language spoken by ranch houses” that skyscrapers “have threatened to get even taller” and that some vague but menacing figure known as “Grathshashon” had “returned.” Carson’s bizarre beliefs were no further clarified in a series of emails to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao in which he attempted to persuade his fellow cabinet member to sign a treaty bringing an end to the “senseless war between houses and cars.” Even more puzzling though was a series of urgent emails that Carson sent to White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus on February 28 in which he stated that he had become trapped in his email and could not find his way out.Such peculiar and unsettling behavior appears to be pervasive throughout the president’s cabinet. The Department of Health and Human Services for instance compiled a disconcerting list of alternatives to Obamacare for the president to look over which included such options as conscripting all citizens into the military and raising the price of specialist visits to $158000 apiece. Moreover the nation’s new secretary of state Rex Tillerson signaled a sharp turn from the diplomacy pursued under the Obama administration by issuing a memo laying out an ambitious slate of new global initiatives ranging from “working to restore American-sponsored coups to pre-1990 levels” to having the United States create a “new catastrophic power vacuum somewhere else in [the] world to take pressure off [the] Middle East.” Additional documents showed that Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin tried to personally redesign U.S. currency as he saw fit. In an email to a colleague regarding the new $20 bills that feature an image of Harriet Tubman Mnuchin asked if there was “any way we can get someone like Dwight Eisenhower or General MacArthur on there instead?” and proceeded to list off dozens of other individuals from James K. Polk to Milton Friedman whom he considered more deserving of adorning U.S. money.Given the nation’s deepening concerns about the commander in chief’s impartiality and fitness to lead it would be heartening to know that the individuals around him—the heads of the various executive departments who are charged with carrying out the many functions of the federal government—were making sound decisions in our nation’s best interest. However the documents obtained by The Onion cast serious doubt on this hopeful notion. What is certain is that each and every one of us will face dire challenges in the four years ahead whether by entering a diminished health care or education system being processed into oil or succumbing to an uncontrollable Superfund site that has gained sentience and begun swallowing our local communities whole.
2017-05-23T09:41:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/who-are-the-deeply-disturbed-individuals-in-trump-s-inn-1819579946,Who Are The Deeply Disturbed Individuals In Trump’s Inner Circle?,The documents referred to in this editorial are part of a trove of classified files provided to The Onion by an anonymous whistleblower in the White House. All of these documents can be found here.The editorial board of The Onion continues to work around the clock forcing its cramped basement of illegal migrant laborers to sift through page after page of classified White House documents. And as more and more information is pieced together one stark truth has emerged again and again: Each and every one of President Trump’s closest advisors and confidants is psychologically disturbed in some profound and perverse way.Let’s first turn to the peculiar fixations of Vice President Mike Pence who appears uninterested in carrying out the prescribed functions of his office and more inclined to spend his time critiquing his pastor’s sermons for emphasizing the concept of love too frequently or barring his staff from speaking certain words like “entangled” and “cloture” which he considers too crass to be uttered in his company. Moreover Pence seems to show little regard for the federal government’s time or money having attempted to spend one-tenth of the government’s budget on tithing and using significant portions of the workday to browse his personal collection of aborted-fetus protest placards or to sketch out his fanciful ideas for holy inventions. The only evidence The Onion could find of the vice president actually engaging with his fellow politicians in Washington was a memo he authored identifying heretics in the U.S. Senate. Indeed few officials are even able to meet with Pence as he requires all individuals to fill out a comprehensive questionnaire that includes such prompts as “Please list the dates of all your spiritual rebirths” and “Have you ever stood directly adjacent to another man’s wife?” before they are allowed to enter his residence or office.The most unsettling member of Trump’s inner circle however appears to be Chief Strategist Steve Bannon whose documented actions such as his request that the Interior Department send him pictures of its most crushed and mutilated roadkill or this secret recording of him eating lunch have caused a significant number of The Onion’s analysts to begin vomiting violently and fall into a shuddering wide-eyed stupor as if a plague of sorts had been transmitted to them simply by reading about Bannon’s behavior. Based on the documents that our team has been able to endure it appears the chief strategist has caused considerable harm to animals people and property in the West Wing from dismembering rodents to gnawing multiple times through sewage pipes. Moreover in March the White House Physician traced a horrific infectious disease outbreak to Bannon’s office. It seems that Bannon is doing something odious and concerning at every moment of the day whether it’s having biopsied tissue and various surgical retractors delivered to his office scuttling through the ventilation shafts or sending back the chicken he ordered from the White House kitchen for being dead and cooked. However what is most worrying about Bannon are his distinctly sinister ambitions as evidenced in an extremely dark and disturbing first draft of a speech he prepared for Donald Trump or his apparent coaxing of the president into signing an ominous executive order titled “Authorizing the Execution of the President by the Chief White House Strategist Should Such Action Be Deemed Advisable and Establishing a Protocol of Succession in Such Event.” There is no telling what horrors Bannon would seek to enact if he were to gain further power.Whereas Bannon appears elusive solitary and tight-lipped White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway is revealed in these documents to be desperately in need of the public spotlight. Indeed a telling series of emails with Fox News demonstrates just how needy she is as Conway made clear that she would “physically disappear from the visible spectrum if [she does] not appear on television every 24 hours.” Moreover Conway seeks such frequent media attention that she receives a weekly television appearance schedule with a color-coded key explaining how she should behave on camera from acting “fiercely incredulous” to “turn[ing the] conversation into an attack on immigrants” to “accus[ing] Obama of whatever Trump is being accused of.” Privately however Conway appears to be more relaxed indulging herself with a daily blink at 12:45 p.m. In addition a Craigslist ad she posted in March titled “Woman seeks young man willing to withstand physical blows” reveals how she decompresses from the strains of the White House describing herself as “a married white woman in her early 50s looking for a young man (18-24) who would be willing to let me beat the shit out of him for half an hour or so.”One of the most enigmatic figures in Trump’s inner circle is Senior Advisor Stephen Miller who keeps a lower profile and for understandable reason: his sexual perversions are particularly pronounced and distasteful. In an unsettling series of emails sent to fellow West Wing staffers Miller explained that he has been following a new woman around town alludes to an activity he plans to engage in with the mannequins at Macy’s and speaks of a rather large package he had delivered from a company called Pink Cherry Inflatables. Moreover Mr. Miller apparently decided to test torture methods on himself telling the heads of the CIA and Defense Department that he has “reason to believe our enhanced interrogation tactics may be having the exact opposite effect on detainees than what is intended. Put simply they feel great. Better than great actually.” While the Oval Office may wish that Miller’s depraved desires could be kept under wraps his perversions have not gone unnoticed by those outside the administration: a number of disgusted West Wing tour members have spoken of their disturbing encounters with Miller in voicemails left on the White House Visitor Center telephone line.In stark contrast to Pence Bannon Conway and Miller all of whom evidently pursue their own unique and bizarre pleasures in the White House there is a figure in Trump’s orbit who appears to know only misery and suffering: Press Secretary Sean Spicer. Spicer seems to have no allies in the administration as evidenced by a secret recording of two West Wing staffers discussing the variety of punishments they wanted to inflict on Spicer who is heard in the background whimpering inside his punishment crate. Indeed the trove of leaked documents confirm that Spicer is regularly disciplined and abused by the president from being forced to spray down Steve Bannon to losing his eating privileges. Spicer himself confirmed his sad plight in a series of candid and increasingly manic emails to his only apparent friend and confidant his Uncle Wilbur with whom he shared his initial elation at being hired by Trump his growing disillusionment with his job and the very nature of truth itself and eventually his tragic and complete break with reality.Somewhat similar to Spicer Chief of Staff Reince Priebus appears to receive no discernible respect from either his boss or his peers as he seemingly alone carries out the necessary day-to-day operations of the Trump White House. According to the documents Priebus compiled all the candidates including Neil Gorsuch Antonin Scalia Jr. and Judge Doom for the official shortlist of potential Supreme Court nominees; performed all the legwork of persuading congressmen to vote for the American Health Care Act; and helped HUD Secretary Ben Carson when he became trapped in his email. However based on the evidence available to The Onion the only appreciation Priebus has ever received in return for his efforts was an extensive amount of fan mail from an 8-year-old girl.And finally there’s Senior Advisor Jared Kushner who appears as if he is earnestly attempting to assist the administration having devised for example several solutions to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict ranging from “Israel gets Jerusalem but Palestine gets it on weekends and holidays” to “Faster internet (both sides).” However not much more can be gleaned about this obscure figure as he is constantly recusing himself from various events such as the East Asia Summit the White House Easter Egg Roll and the National Cherry Blossom Festival due to his significant investments in them and the considerable sums of money he stands to make from their proceedings.As the nation rollicks and careens about amid a fantastic political storm it is more important than ever to know who is steering our course. Unfortunately the portraits that are emerging of the seldom seen and poorly known individuals in Trump’s inner circle are far from reassuring. According to the official documents penned by these very individuals the fate of the most powerful nation the world has ever known now rests in the hands of a disconcerting assortment of freaks failures accursed abominations of nature and straight-up perverts any and all of whom may be profiting handsomely off of whatever you happen to be doing at any given moment.
2017-05-22T11:42:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/what-is-trump-hiding-1819579940,What Is Trump Hiding?,The documents referred to in this editorial are part of a trove of classified files provided to The Onion by an anonymous whistle-blower in the White House. All of these documents can be found here.Who is Donald Trump truly? What are the private thoughts he contemplates? And how will his presidency reshape America? As The Onion’s 300000 staffers in its news bureaus and manual labor camps around the world continue to pore through the immense trove of documents obtained from an anonymous White House source the answers that are emerging to these questions are deeply unnerving and suggest grave outcomes for the American people the current international order Wolf Blitzer four of the five Great Lakes and most devastatingly the nation’s lighthouses and lighthouse keepers.The evidence of improper—if not outright criminal—behavior is ample from a damning series of encrypted emails sent directly to President Trump from Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov to a revealing invoice from Trump’s personal accountant charging the president $111.90 for a “replacement gas valve for [his] evidence furnace” to a secret money-throwing party with Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein. The abuse of the nation’s highest office appears to be rampant and ongoing.However beyond the headline-grabbing scandals of Russian collusion tax evasion and conflicts of interest what these documents reveal above all else is that there is something haunting President Trump. Throughout these pages there is substantial proof that Trump is afflicted with some severe emotional disorder given that he requires arm restraints in his bed and calls out the name “Frederick” whenever he sleeps that he scrapped his plan for a new golf course because its layout was too painfully reminiscent of the supple curves of Marla Maples and that he has his aides lay him down on the Oval Office couch each evening and repeat the words “handsome” “luxury” and “strong” for 20 to 30 minutes in a calm and steady tone of voice to soothe his destructive impulses.Indeed the president’s behavioral problems have become such a problem that his staffers have banned certain TV channels from ever being shown in the West Wing as the accents on the BBC and the fast-moving graphics on the Weather Channel tend to induce his spastic outbursts.But what is it exactly that haunts Donald Trump? Most notably the president appears preoccupied with the question of his rightful claim to the presidency. In the days immediately following his inauguration Trump signed a series of increasingly lengthy and aggressively worded executive orders designating himself as the legitimate and undisputed 45th president of the United States legally requiring that he “be held in the same regard as all former U.S. presidents including: I. Abraham Lincoln II. Ronald Reagan III. Barack Obama.” In addition despite receiving a cordial handwritten letter from President Obama on his first day in office Trump seems determined to undo his predecessor’s signature accomplishments as evidenced by the secret executive order he issued on February 26 titled “Reversing the Harmful Legacy of Barack Obama by Reanimating the Remains of Osama Bin Laden.”Moreover Trump perceives anyone who disagrees with him as an enemy to be vanquished a tendency most clearly on display in the lawsuit the president filed against a West Wing tour group for yawning in his presence and talking over his favorite Planters Peanuts commercial as well as the defamation suit he filed against the estate of Johannes Gutenberg for “the vindictive and unwarranted character assassination” he has suffered from publications that owe their existence to the invention of the printing press and movable type. The president’s deep personal paranoia is also being channeled through the agencies he controls as revealed in a classified CIA memo that warned the president the Star-Tribune in Wyoming was determined to release a highly damaging blog post about the administration and outlined strategies for eliminating the newspaper with military force.What’s abundantly clear in these documents is that the president thinks almost exclusively of himself and his own personal desires paying little attention to others even his own family members as evidenced by an email exchange between him and White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway regarding Trump’s youngest son. He is obsessed with the material trappings of his job demanding that Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg make numerous upgrades to Air Force One including the installation of marble fixtures marble seats and marble engines on the aircraft and later issuing an executive order declaring that all of his favorite objects in the White House once belonged to President Lincoln from the Resolute Desk to the china collection to Harry Truman’s “The buck stops here” plaque to the White House bowling alley.As the most powerful officeholder on the planet Trump’s egoism dark paranoia and quickness to cast blame are particularly disquieting. In just his first few weeks in office he enacted numerous secret executive actions for purposes that remain disturbingly opaque such as the order he issued on February 15 authorizing the use of the Grand Canyon as a temporary morgue or the one he issued just two days later enacting a mysterious program known only as the Theseus Protocol.Perhaps most disturbingly though the president and his team have developed a fill-in-the-blanks executive order template that allows them to quickly and easily crack down on whichever racial religious or ethnic group they please simply by inserting a handful of details into the text—a “fear-inducing noun” here and “an adjective that implies ‘subhuman’ without explicitly stating it” there—and in so doing immediately curtailing the rights of large swaths of the populace.As Americans we hope that our president approaches the momentous challenges of the job with a resolute measured and humane mind-set. However the documents that have been tirelessly examined and reexamined by The Onion’s most highly skilled child laborers reveal that the occupant of the highest seat in our country spends more time doodling than paying attention in budget meetings and has considerable trouble completing even the most basic word-search puzzles in his daily intelligence briefings.So what can be said about President Trump and the imprint he will leave on this country? Perhaps the only definitive pronouncement to be made is that should his next four years follow the pattern of his first four months citizens should prepare themselves for a stark erosion of America’s bedrock ideals and smoldering pockmarked coastlines completely devoid of any lighthouses.
2017-05-17T16:02:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/kicking-screaming-warren-buffett-dragged-from-caesars-1819579935,Kicking, Screaming Warren Buffett Dragged From Caesars Palace After Losing Everything At Roulette Wheel,LAS VEGAS—Cursing at security officers as he fought their efforts to escort him from the premises a kicking screaming Warren Buffett was reportedly dragged from Caesars Palace Hotel and Casino early Wednesday morning after losing his entire fortune playing roulette.The Berkshire Hathaway chairman who sources said had been betting almost continuously and in progressively greater amounts since checking into the hotel approximately 12 hours earlier reportedly squandered $78.7 billion in stocks bonds real estate and liquid assets by the time guards arrived to remove him.“It was hard watching him blow all his money like that just sitting there putting down these giant stacks of chips even as he was getting deeper into the hole” said casino patron Dwayne Mitchum adding that Buffett initially seemed upbeat—drinking comped rum-and-cokes and casually dispensing free mutual-fund advice to other players—before his mood began darkening as he gambled away more and more of his wealth. “Then when he lost his very last $3.5 billion you could almost see the blood draining from his face. He kind of froze for a second like he was in some kind of trance.”“That’s when he slumped against the table and just started sobbing” Mitchum added.According to sources the 86-year-old business magnate frequently attempted to borrow money over the course of his gambling binge once he had exhausted his own personal resources. While Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charlie Munger declined to lend him $40 billion despite Buffett’s promise he’d have it “back and then some” in an hour Buffett was eventually able to have $5 billion wired to him by several of the company’s senior board members whose concerns were reportedly allayed by assurances that he was “good for it.”“For a little while at least he was riding a really hot hand—I remember around midnight he won four or five $2 billion bets in a row” croupier Molly Giorgi told reporters noting that at one point the so-called Oracle of Omaha had attracted the attention of two young women who stood on either side and cheered him on as he collected his winnings. “But then he started wagering $6 billion here $10 billion there and pretty soon he was down to just a few billion which was all the money he had left in the world.”“When he pushed those last chips toward me I asked him if he was sure and he just loosened his tie smoothed back his hair and said ‘Shut up and put it on 22’” she continued recalling that the room went silent as the ball skittered around before finally landing on 19. “Once he saw he’d lost he just snapped wailing about how he was on the hook for billions to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and that he didn’t know what they’d do when they found out he was now completely broke.”Witnesses confirmed that as security personnel approached a disheveled perspiring Buffett launched into a stream of verbal attacks directed at casino employees whom he accused of either rigging the wheel or using an “illegal ball.” Buffett reportedly then made a sudden break toward the slot machine area where he snatched several patrons’ cups of quarters before tripping over his own feet and stumbling into a cocktail waitress.Quickly pinned to the floor by guards he was then whisked out a side door frantically screaming for help because “those casino crooks took all my money.”“I felt bad seeing him take the loss so poorly but then again I was standing near him when he hit a $10 billion column bet and tucked 2.8 [billion] into my shirt pocket for being his ‘lucky charm’” said Phoenix-area visitor and now 239th richest person in America Bob Raskow. “But that’s Vegas for you—it doesn’t matter if you run the fourth-largest public company on the planet the house always wins.”At press time a trembling Buffett was seen sitting on the curb outside Caesars Palace with his head in his hands repeatedly dialing his wife’s number and hanging up as soon as he heard her voice.
2017-05-11T13:56:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/pressure-mounting-for-humans-to-step-down-as-head-of-fa-1819579924,Pressure Mounting For Humans To Step Down As Head Of Failing Global Ecosystem,EARTH—Noting that the species’ tenure in the leadership role has been marked by an incompetence and shortsightedness that has caused irreparable damage sources reported Thursday that humans are facing increased calls to give up their position as head of the world’s failing ecosystem.The critics clamoring for Homo sapiens to step down argue that as leader of the earth’s environment they have been responsible for one disaster after another while over the past several decades the global ecological organization has essentially stopped functioning due to humanity’s gross mismanagement.“Since taking control of the ecosystem human beings have misallocated its resources and left many of its operations teetering on the brink of collapse” said Tracy Eldridge a spokesperson for organisms demanding a change in leadership noting that humans have overseen massive cuts in species around the world and that thousands more are expected to be eliminated within the next year alone. “Such wastefulness has threatened the long-term viability of the planet’s habitat but humans appear unable to formulate an actionable plan to keep it running smoothly.”“If they stay in charge and continue making all the major strategic decisions for this ecosystem I don’t see how it can last more than another few years” she added.According to public records humans have failed to implement quality control procedures for their water supply or meet annual targets for carbon reduction and it was under their stewardship that the earth broke its impressive string of 180 million consecutive quarters of gains in biodiversity. Eldridge stated that ecosystem stakeholders have given humanity plenty of time to overcome early missteps like deforestation but it has repeatedly failed to recognize its strategic mistakes and find ways to maintain a functioning environment.Other species have observed that before humans took over the global ecosystem had been a model organization with complex groups of highly successful biomes working together productively. However after Homo sapiens assumed control the ecosystem reportedly saw a decline in its overall capacity to host life that has only accelerated in recent decades as multiple habitat divisions have faltered and nearly gone under.“Our traditional generators of biodiversity—rainforests wetlands coral reefs—have been scaled back dramatically by humans and have seen their productivity plummet as a result” said Eldridge who added that critical ecological initiatives such as pollination have also seen steep declines in their output. “The world habitat had been running a huge surplus on fresh water and ozone before humans but after years of neglect and little to no investment from management those strategic assets are severely depleted.”She continued “The way things look right now they might have to shut down the Arctic division completely.”Sources confirmed that species retention has fallen to an all-time low under humanity’s tenure with many long-serving members of the ecosystem like the Western black rhinoceros the auroch the Caspian tiger and the passenger pigeon leaving the planet completely.Those calling for removing humanity from its post claim the earth has far more qualified leaders currently waiting in the wings species that are more favorably regarded throughout the ecosystem have shown they can cooperate with other organisms and have a proven track record of success dating back tens of millions of years.“There is a large contingent within the biosphere that would love to see ants take over after humans step down” said Eldridge who cited the insects’ tireless work ethic longer tenure on the planet and ability to work well in groups. “It has become very clear that humans will always place their own personal gain above the interests of their subordinate species and that they have little or no interest in the long-term prospects of their ecosystem.”“Every day the humans remain in charge we are one day closer to the environment becoming a completely failed enterprise” she continued.Eldridge added that if human beings do not voluntarily step down as head of the ecosystem the environment might have to take drastic action to remove them forcibly.
2017-05-03T15:22:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/greyhound-to-send-chimps-on-pioneering-bus-trip-from-bu-1819579895,Greyhound To Send Chimps On Pioneering Bus Trip From Buffalo To Atlantic City,Interstate Voyage Seen As Step Toward One Day Placing Humans On RouteDALLAS—In order to assess the viability of the route for potential travel by human beings Greyhound officials announced at a press conference Wednesday a mission that will send a pair of chimpanzees on a pioneering 457-mile overland bus trip from Buffalo NY to Atlantic City NJ.Greyhound researchers said that the adult chimps—named Kip and Dottie—would depart at 6 a.m. from the Metro Transportation Center in downtown Buffalo and with luck arrive seven hours and 20 minutes later at the Atlantic City bus terminal an unprecedented journey that will reportedly push the animals to their physical and mental limits.“For years we’ve dreamed of putting this extraordinary voyage within the reach of humans and soon we will be one step closer to making that dream a reality” said Greyhound spokesperson Andrea Gipson explaining that data gathered from the mission will be invaluable in terms of developing the techniques and technologies an eventual human crew will require. “We’re still years away from mankind being able to endure a trip of this nature but if successful what we learn from this undertaking will be crucial in opening up a bold new era of travel.”“It’s remarkable to contemplate” added Gipson. “Even sending animals on a trip like this was once unthinkable.”Gipson went on to say that during their mission Kip and Dottie would face challenges including extreme discomfort and lengthy periods of boredom occasionally interrupted by moments of acute aggravation not to mention frequent car sickness brought on by the harrowing interstate trek. Throughout their trip their mobility will reportedly be extremely hampered by seats that recline just an eighth of an inch and that will force the chimps to get what little sleep they can in a nearly vertical position.“We will monitor Kip and Dottie’s vital signs closely to see how the harsh conditions of the journey through the bleakest reaches of Western New York and upstate Pennsylvania affect their well-being” Gipson said. “As our nearest biological relatives chimps are the ideal test subjects to gauge how our own species might react when exposed to exceptionally stressful conditions such as the constant smell of warm egg salad or a flat tire occurring just 20 minutes into the trip.”Greyhound’s ground team in Dallas will reportedly observe the effects the journey will have on the chimpanzees by equipping them with a handful of scratch-off lottery tickets in order to monitor the possible degradation of the animals’ visual acuity and hand-eye coordination. Sources told reporters that the chimps will also be provided with one large bag of circus peanuts apiece to analyze changes in critical thinking as measured by how effectively they ration the treats until the bus reaches the refueling station at the halfway point—a Roy Rogers in New York’s Southern Tier region.According to researchers the chimps will be outfitted in a standard uniform of sweatpants and flip-flops with the addition of special sensors to record the the body temperature heart rate and blood pressure of the animals as they are exposed to temperature extremes from sitting for hours in constant sunlight streaming through unshaded windows and being blasted by frigid air from broken air-conditioning vents directly overhead.“Kip and Dottie have undergone months of exhaustive training so that their reflexes are in peak condition to contend with floors that are simultaneously sticky and slick with spilled 7-Up” Gipson said referring to one of the unique phenomena that occur on such journeys and nowhere else known to science. “But as much as we can do to prepare them for this trip there are still many many unknowns. Will they be able to mentally withstand a flickering overhead TV screen the volume of which will for no reason get higher and lower at random intervals? And while we’ve prepared for at least one extended highway breakdown what about significant delays? How will the animals cope with a toilet that backs up 20 miles into the trip?”Continued Gipson “The reality of the situation is once the bus hits the I-476 ramp the chimps are very much on their own.”Greyhound’s methodology has come under scrutiny in the past most notably after 1999’s New York-to-D.C. disaster in which a dog named Chief was killed when his 55-seat vehicle skidded into a wall of the Lincoln Tunnel just 17 minutes after departure.Nevertheless officials remained optimistic that this latest research mission would yield results that would bring humanity ever closer to Western New York/coastal New Jersey bus travel.“We envision a future in which any person can purchase a low-cost bus ticket and be gambling their life’s savings away within just a half-day’s travel” Gipson said. “And believe it or not we’re even confident that one day a dental receptionist from Cheektowaga will be able to attend a rowdy drunken bachelorette party and already be on her way home within 24 hours filled with intense shame and regret and periodically vomiting into a plastic bag she acquired at a souvenir shop on the Atlantic City boardwalk—and Kip and Dottie will have no small part in that momentous achievement.”“Unfortunately for them there’s only enough fuel in the tank for a one-way trip” Gipson added.
2017-04-27T11:54:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/ecuadorian-officials-starting-to-get-sick-of-julian-ass-1819579878,Ecuadorian Officials Starting To Get Sick Of Julian Assange Always Leaving Dirty Dishes All Over Embassy,LONDON—Adding to the already long list of grievances they had with their guest officials at the Ecuadorian embassy reported Thursday that they were beginning to get really sick of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange always leaving his dirty dishes around the premises.Sources said that Assange whose presence has reportedly grown more and more disruptive since his arrival in 2012 has a habit of abandoning sauce-covered plates in random consular offices throughout the building. In addition officials complained that Assange often blasts loud techno music during important calls with Quito makes awkward conversation with visitors applying for visas and loafs around conference rooms in his ratty stained briefs while diplomats attempt to conduct meetings.“Pretty much every day I come into the kitchen and he’s burned a bunch of eggs on the pan which he then just leaves on the stove” said Ecuadorian ambassador Juan Falconí Puig adding that while Assange typically lets weeks’ worth of bowls filled with milk residue and cereal-encrusted spoons pile up in the sink they have also been discovered on windowsills in the hallway outside his door and on one occasion on top of a toilet tank. “He also leaves his takeout containers lying around everywhere including the reception area so people just get smacked by the odor of curry the minute they walk in.”“And I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had to pull clumps of stringy white hair out of the shower” added Puig. “It’s like come on Julian. Other people use that shower too.”Puig told reporters that staff members have confronted the 45-year-old multiple times about his behavior but with little success. On issues ranging from eating other people’s food to leaving dirty socks strewn on the embassy’s main staircase to never in almost five years replacing the toilet paper Puig said that Assange usually makes a big show of improving for a few days but then goes right back to his old habits.Sources confirmed that frustrated Ecuadorian officials have resorted to leaving harshly worded notes for Assange but—as was the case with messages insisting Assange not to use the microwave to cook fish and not to drape wet towels on the backs of antique leather armchairs—the strategy has had no apparent effect.“Yesterday I was having a meeting with the Scottish Secretary of State and Julian wanders into the conference room props his bare feet up on the table and just starts cutting his toenails” said Puig noting that he had to stop himself from gagging when a small yellowed clipping nearly hit the rim of his water glass. “Fine we’re all sharing the same space but at least put on a shirt if you’re going to walk right through a negotiation session with the leaders of our host nation you know?”“Maybe then we wouldn’t mind as much when he opens a brand new jar of peanut butter and then immediately loses the lid” continued Puig.According to Puig staff members have gently tried hinting that Assange should find a new place to live by pointing out how many other nice embassies there are around town recently going so far as to slip in a link to the Belgian embassy at the bottom of an internal email about promoting Galapagos tourism. But officials told reporters that Assange may in fact be growing even more comfortable in his current surroundings judging by the purchase of a large bookcase he was heard hammering together during a banquet for dignitaries from five other South American nations.“It would be one thing if it was just him but he’s got these weird friends who come around at all hours” said Puig referring to the nameless group of associates who typically show up after midnight remain silent even when greeted and always keep their faces covered with black bandanas. “It’s ridiculous—for some reason they insist on just hanging out here.”“Not to mention how slow the internet gets when they’re using it” added Puig. “God knows what they’re all doing up there.”
2017-04-18T11:58:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/nasa-designs-suit-capable-of-protecting-humans-hoping-t-1819579836,NASA Designs Suit Capable Of Protecting Humans Hoping To One Day Live On Earth,WASHINGTON—Saying the groundbreaking new technology could allow humans to withstand the harsh conditions they will experience on the planet’s surface NASA confirmed Tuesday that it has created a climate-controlled suit capable of protecting people who hope to one day live on Earth.Agency officials told reporters that the suit which they have named the Terrestrial Mobility Unit is specifically engineered to keep humans safe from the extreme temperatures and unbreathable atmosphere found on Earth increasing the possibility that decades from now they may be able to inhabit the dangerous planet. “Our team has finally created a functional reliable space suit that humans may someday use to survive the punishing environment they encounter on Earth” said NASA senior research scientist Catherine Seltzer who spearheaded the 12-year $180 million project and helped devise the unique polymers that allow the suit to endure a nonstop bombardment of intense ultraviolet radiation. “From the devastating storm systems sweeping the planet to the many toxic gases filling its atmosphere Earth will be hostile to human life. But with the Terrestrial Mobility Unit a person may actually be able to walk safely across its surface.”“As incredible as it sounds we might even have a permanent human settlement on Earth 100 years from now” she added.According to NASA the suit contains a state-of-the-art environmental control system that uses water vaporization to cool the wearer in the midst of scorching temperatures and that filters out poisonous levels of carbon dioxide to maintain oxygen supplies allowing a person to survive for extended periods of time in the Earth’s unforgiving terrestrial climate. In addition an impenetrable semirigid fiber has reportedly been incorporated into the suit as protection against an atmosphere expected to be ridden with dense particulate matter including an unknown number of highly lethal toxins.“Even the slightest contact with the Earth’s atmosphere will quickly prove fatal so we’ve taken every conceivable precaution” said NASA engineer James Mullen explaining that computer simulations showed that unprotected humans exposed to the planet’s sun for any amount of time would immediately suffer fourth-degree burns all over their bodies. “The suit has even been specially fortified with a new high-density polymer-metal composite that can act as a defense in the event of extreme weather events such as acid rain downpours continent-spanning dust storms and clusters of Category 5 hurricanes any one of which can occur at any time without warning and last for years.”Mullen went on to say that even a tiny pinprick in the Terrestrial Mobility Unit would cause its wearer to die a horrific death though there remains debate as to what would kill the person first—extreme temperature asphyxiation from low oxygen or the planet’s wildly fluctuating air pressure which would either boil off a human’s blood or simply crush him or her flat.Despite the substantial protections afforded by the suit NASA officials were quick to point out that even while wearing it no human could remain on the Earth’s surface for more than three or four hours before having to retreat to a titanium-reinforced bunker hundreds of feet underground.“The truth is we won’t know just how the suit will respond to being on Earth until we take those first brave steps 50 or 60 years from now” Mullen said. “We can run all the tests we want but at the end of the day we’ll be placing actual human beings on a highly unstable planet with an environment that is extremely unsafe not just for us but for all carbon-based life.”“All we can do right now is to continue upgrading our design and hope for the best” he added.A NASA spokesperson confirmed that excitement for the project has resulted in an accelerated production schedule that could conceivably allow thousands of human beings to be living on Earth by 2075.
2017-03-23T14:05:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/hundreds-of-blind-pallid-disney-characters-discovered-1819579793,Hundreds Of Blind, Pallid Disney Characters Discovered Living In Caves Deep Within Space Mountain,ORLANDO FL—Confirming years of rumored sightings by visitors to the theme park officials from Walt Disney World said Tuesday that several hundred blind and bedraggled Disney characters are living in caves deep within Space Mountain. The misshapen mascots who after decades spent in total darkness have sickly gray skin and cloudy sightless eyes were reportedly found huddled together in a network of caverns extending far beneath the popular Tomorrowland attraction.“Our maintenance crew recently spotted an unusual tunnel inside Space Mountain and after shining a light inside saw several pale forms skitter away into the darkness” said Walt Disney World president George Kalogridis noting that the light caused the mascots to hiss raise their gloved hands in terror and flee before anyone could get a good look at them. “Then our workers rounded a corner to find dozens of creatures clinging to the walls of the cavern including one with scattered patches of fur they identified as Goofy and another with skin grown over its eyes whom they believe was Minnie Mouse.”“We wish to stress that while they appear grotesque they also seem to be harmless” he continued. “They are incredibly sensitive to sound and scramble deeper into their caves anytime one of the roller-coaster cars speed past.”A team of park engineers who explored the ride’s network of hand-clawed tunnels told reporters they had heard far away in the darkness a gasping quack that likely belonged to Donald Duck. They also reported hearing a louder bleating sound that was revealed to have been caused by an emaciated Dumbo whose rib cage was clearly visible beneath his hide and who groped around the darkness with his trunk in search of edible mold.Investigating the source of what they described as “a chorus of horrifying yowls” several team members reportedly encountered a roving troop of princesses that included Elsa Cinderella and Jasmine all of whom had apparently lived so long in the pitch-black cramped tunnels that they now clambered about comfortably in their dresses and ball gowns as quadrupeds.“When we were going up that first incline we saw a few pairs of empty white eyes glowing in the distance but I just assumed that was part of the ride” said 37-year-old Brendan Weeks of South Bend Indiana one of many Space Mountain riders who have caught a glimpse of the subterranean Disney characters. “Then when we were about to take the big drop I saw these weird animal things that kind of looked like the Country Bear Jamboree. The one with the banjo was gnawing on some sort of animal carcass. I think it might’ve been another bear.”“But other than that it was a really fun ride” he added.Hours into its search of the outer-space-themed ride the team repelled into a massive foul-smelling cavern strewn with mascot droppings observing there a rail-thin and jaundiced Chip and Dale lapping runoff from the attraction’s plumbing. One employee recalled being startled as he bumped his head in the dark and shone his flashlight upward to find the Seven Dwarfs hanging from the tunnel ceiling where they pawed at their tick-ridden beards and waited for a humpbacked Snow White to regurgitate into their open mouths.Sources at Disney speculate that many of the costumed characters have been underground since Space Mountain’s 1975 opening noting that they have had enough time to develop an acute sense of hearing to compensate for their inability to see. It is believed they can detect when an object falls from the roller coaster because they quickly scurry out to retrieve any such item and later add it to their nest of hoarded sunglasses keys lip balm and assorted gift shop purchases.Similarly an eyeless translucent-skinned Jiminy Cricket reportedly stumbles his way through the labyrinth of dirt tunnels by humming broken strains of “When You Wish Upon A Star” and listening to the echoes of his faltering voice.“We’re really not sure what to do with any of these old mascots” Kalogridis said. “There’s obviously no place in the Magic Kingdom for a Tinkerbell that emits hideous clicking noises to signal other mascots when they’re in danger.”“For all we know there could be thousands more down there we aren’t even aware of” he added. “Not to mention what we’ll find when we drain Pirates of the Caribbean.”At press time Disney officials confirmed they had cemented shut every entrance to Space Mountain after night-vision cameras in the caves spotted former CEO Michael Eisner skulking in the darkness.
2017-03-22T11:40:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/archaeologists-uncover-last-human-to-die-happy-1819579784,Archaeologists Uncover Last Human To Die Happy,DEMBECHA ETHIOPIA—In a startling find that contributes significantly to the understanding of modern man’s evolutionary development University of Edinburgh archaeologists working in Ethiopia’s Afar Region announced Wednesday that they have uncovered the preserved remains of the last human to die happy.According to the researchers carbon dating concluded that the fossilized skeleton is that of a Paleolithic man—nicknamed “Felix” by the team of scientists responsible for the find—who died perfectly contented and unencumbered by regret roughly 30000 years ago.“It’s truly incredible—Felix unequivocally demonstrates that early humans were still capable of dying completely fulfilled as late as the Upper Paleolithic” said lead researcher Evgenia Halytsky who went on to say that scientists had previously believed any such trait had disappeared many millennia earlier. “The vast majority of research points to our species almost never experiencing even a day of serenity for the last million years so Felix totally upends any of our previous notions about human evolution.”“To think that only 300 centuries ago a human being actually died happy” Halytsky added.Researchers said that a spectral analysis of the remains indicated wear in Felix’s lower extremities consistent with a long confident gait. Additionally forensic odontology tests revealed that the man had never grinded his teeth stunning scientists who had until now accepted that this behavior had become ubiquitous at roughly the same time humans developed abstract thought and the capacity to project into the future.Experts also said that measurements of the man’s upper thoracic spine demonstrated that he had walked with his chest thrust forward optimistically and that his vertebrae were completely absent of any curvature that would have indicated his having gone through life with his head held in a drooping manner or with his eyes cast to the ground.But Halytsky told reporters that what is perhaps most exciting about the find is how it sheds light on a series of mysterious and until now incomprehensible prehistoric cave paintings discovered in 2009 less than a mile away from the new site.“We are now almost certain that the figure depicted in the paintings leading successful hunts and cheerfully brokering peaceful resolutions among his fellow tribesmen—who was initially regarded as some kind of mythological being—is in fact Felix” Halytsky said. “This also lends support to the theory that Felix died having been fully aware of the extent of his positive impact on his society which appears to have been substantial.”“Some of the drawings illustrate him enjoying a family life more loving affectionate and tolerant than any we’ve ever seen throughout prehistory or otherwise leading us to believe that his heart was overflowing with his kinsfolk’s love when he passed away” Halytsky continued.However enthusiasm for the recent findings has reportedly been tempered by a competing theory that Felix was only content at the time of his death because he had decided to kill himself and end his agony all at once.
2017-03-15T10:53:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/innovative-business-always-on-the-cutting-edge-of-what-1819579727,Innovative Business Always On The Cutting Edge Of What Other Companies Have Been Doing For A Few Years,MINNEAPOLIS—Explaining how the company remains innovative in a fast-paced industry executives from DigiVista Media told reporters Wednesday that the marketing firm consistently positions itself on the leading edge of what its competitors have been doing for the past few years.“The landscape is always changing so we’re continually embracing revolutionary ideas that our rivals succeeded with in the past” said DigiVista senior marketing manager Aaron Reynolds who credited this approach with keeping the groundbreaking company at the forefront of where the field was five or six years ago. “In this business you have to constantly push the boundaries in terms of adopting strategies from other people that are by now well-established industry practice.”“You just can’t wait for inspiration to come to you” he continued. “You’ve got to see it come to somebody else first and then pounce on it once it’s been thoroughly proven in the marketplace.”According to DigiVista CEO Bill Hallihan employees at his pioneering firm monitor what everyone else in marketing is doing hastily restructure their business to do the exact same thing and then watch to see what advancements the industry makes next. Hallihan said it’s this commitment to innovation that allows his company to always provide its clients with the next ingenious product that has already been in use for quite some time.“Part of what makes us such trailblazers is our willingness to completely scrap what we’re doing right now in favor of a strategy that’s been fairly ubiquitous since 2013” said Hallihan noting that he hopes a recent rollout of real-time bidding and ad exchange platforms will place DigiVista firmly atop the list of leading marketing firms of the beginning of the decade. “Our creative focus on methods developed by other companies is what’s going to drive our business right to where the vanguard of this industry used to be.” “Yeah sometimes we have to push the envelope on what could be done in 2010 but we don’t know any other way around here” he added.Hallihan hinted that DigiVista is preparing to disrupt the marketing world once more this time by proactively embracing original concepts that its competitors put in place just 12 to 18 months ago. But he said such a gambit should come as no surprise to anyone familiar with the company’s history of taking substantial risks to adopt the very same business plans that other more successful firms were using just a short while back.“Whether it’s native advertising or advanced data collection if you can’t deliver what previously paid off elsewhere you’re finished” Hallihan said. “But as long as there’s that spirit of innovation in others we’re going to be around quite a while.”At press time sources confirmed DigiVista had adopted another years-old strategy of its competitors laying off approximately 20 percent of its workforce.
2017-02-24T15:02:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/child-protective-services-take-80-million-children-into-1819579659,Child Protective Services Take 80 Million Children Into Custody After Discovering No One In Country Fit To Be Parent,WASHINGTON—Saying no one in the country is responsible or reliable enough to serve as a legal guardian child protective services officials from all 50 states confirmed Friday that they had found all of the nation’s adults unfit to be parents and had taken custody of approximately 80 million children.Child welfare workers told reporters they removed all persons under the age of 18 from their unsuitable living situations and placed them under state supervision after home visits revealed that none of the 68 million parents in the United States possessed the judgment or emotional maturity necessary to raise a child.“Throughout the nation investigations into the home environments of children failed to find a single household in which parents were serving as positive role models in any way” said U.S. Administration for Children and Families spokesperson Lisa Young describing how caseworkers entered homes to find kids eating food of no nutritional value and staring vacantly at the screens of tablet computers. “We soon determined American adults are utterly incapable of setting a good example when it comes to healthy habits or personal behavior.”“The moment you meet these people you realize they have absolutely no business being parents” she added.Dispatched to homes nationwide social services representatives said they typically encountered children who were seated in front of a television for hours at a time with their parents engaged in the very same sedentary behavior on a nearby couch and only interacting with their children to ask what they wanted from the drive-thru. Reports indicate that in some cases that request was made while the parent stared directly into their smartphone and with no attempt at eye contact whatsoever.According to public records in the past week millions of parents have faced child custody hearings and in every case judges ruled that the children many of whom were so unhealthy they reportedly became winded as they climbed the steps of their local courthouse should become wards of the state.“The amount of time these kids were allowed to remain indoors—only leaving the house to go to school or play video games at a friend’s house—was clearly a danger to their physical well-being” said social worker Jonathan Froman of Cook County IL echoing the concerns of his colleagues across the country. “And to see so many of them subsisting entirely on chicken nuggets or Easy Mac—it breaks my heart.”“I mean my god they’re just kids” added Froman.Evidence suggests that the majority of the nation’s children were also underperforming at school something that their apathetic home life contributed greatly to with many parents only willing to spend a few insignificant minutes assisting their children with homework and even the more involved ones being totally unequipped to help in any meaningful way. In addition when asked most parents were unable to name their child’s teacher or at best offered a rough approximation of a name actually from two grades prior.“These children also struggle with temper issues which is to be expected given the profound deficit of interpersonal skills among American parents” Froman said adding that it may be impossible for many children to overcome the maladaptive behaviors they have acquired from watching their parents rage at their own inability to properly assemble a bookcase bully a waiter who failed to bring out entrees with acceptable speed or simply bicker with each other over nothing of consequence year after year. “We’ll do our best to help them but I don’t know if they’ll ever recover to a point where they can lead fulfilling lives as adults.”“I only wish we had found these kids sooner” he added.

I guess it doesn’t matter.”“What do you guys think?” he added.Current projections indicate the “little tweak” which reportedly seemed so insignificant to Ward that he almost didn’t even bother mentioning it will lead in time to the complete disappearance of millions of jobs in manufacturing transportation warehousing mining construction food processing and telecommunications.Reports indicate that the grad student’s spontaneous suggestion involved adjusting the servo motor of an industrial robot by less than 3 millimeters a modification that will forever change the lives of Americans as it renders hundreds of entire occupations obsolete and makes the existing skills and education of many workers all but useless in an utterly transformed economy.“It couldn’t hurt to try anyway” Ward said of his idea whose applications will drastically cut overhead for U.S. companies lead to higher returns for shareholders and cast thousands of the nation’s working- and middle-class communities into abject poverty. “What do we have to lose?”Ward’s spur-of-the-moment recommendation to alter the mechanism “just a smidge” will reportedly cause millions to lose their homes become unable to support their families and never again find work in their fields of expertise events that sources say will result in the creation of a greatly expanded underclass that will remain a permanent feature of American society.“Let’s give it a shot” said professor Barbara Simmons who oversees the lab and who will eventually join the growing number of jobless Americans once her student’s innovation causes her engineering curriculum to become irrevocably outdated. “Hey maybe we’ll learn something at least.”At press time however another student in the robotics lab had stumbled upon a groundbreaking technology that before Ward’s discovery has a chance to devastate the economy will inadvertently wipe out the entire human race.

It’s frustrating because I have a lot to offer.”“After all I was the third-highest-ranking double for the president” he added.Sources said that many of the agents some of whom had their shins broken and reset in order to ensure they stood at Obama’s precise height of 73 inches have been forced by their difficult job searches to relocate well outside the D.C. area. And despite being trained to escape assassination attempts and withstand brutal interrogations the Obama decoys said they are often immediately disqualified by employers for any position that requires face-to-face contact with another human being.Several of the men lamented that health plans under the Affordable Care Act don’t cover elective cosmetic surgeries leaving them with little hope of ever reversing the procedures which reportedly also included forehead lifts and gene therapy designed to alter their skin pigmentation.While the current White House has offered to rehire them the Obama doubles said they did not want to undergo the series of extremely painful operations necessary to resemble President Donald Trump only to find themselves jobless once more in four or at most eight years.“Washing dishes isn’t glamorous but it’s a steady job so I consider myself one of the lucky ones” said Allen O’Neal now an employee of Ruth’s Chris Steak House in Lexington KY who sat in for the president during a visit to Saudi Arabia and met with an unwitting President Vladimir Putin in 2015. “I know a couple of the other guys managed to get jobs together at a car wash in Cincinnati and they say it’s all right.”“If I get tired of this place I might be able to go work with them” he added.While acknowledging that there are a handful of opportunities for Obama impersonators to perform on the major cruise lines or throw out the first pitch at Single-A baseball games the doubles said a non-compete clause in their old White House contracts strictly limits their ability to take on such engagements. One of the Obama lookalikes reportedly paid steep fines after he was caught charging six figures for unauthorized speeches he made to defense contractors and pharmaceutical companies.“When I was first recruited into the program it was a real career highlight but now that I’m back on the job market I’m having regrets” said Jason Newburg 55 who added that he has struggled with depression since leaving the job in which he conducted a joint press conference with Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and hosted the 2013 NBA champion Miami Heat while the real president was in meetings with his national security team. “Things are looking up though. I’m close to landing a job at a call center for a pretty decent-sized bank and meanwhile I’ve got a ribbon-cutting gig at a supermarket in Dallas next Saturday.”“Plus last week the White House called me and asked if I could show up to a state funeral” he added. “There’s no way I’m passing that up.”

According to the earth’s 7.5 billion inhabitants the internet—a technology that allows every human on the face of the planet to communicate and share data with every other human—seemed like an excellent idea at first. But while limited parts of the internet were deemed beneficial and may one day be salvaged the global populace concluded that the overwhelming majority of it is really awful and in some cases even dangerous.“Sure it’s convenient to have this staggering amount of data at your fingertips but once you consider that almost none of it is put to any kind of productive use it just doesn’t seem worth it having it around you know?” said Cleveland-based internet user Rhonda Tibbs 39 echoing the thoughts of all humanity as she described a technology that mostly serves to amplify the voices of alienated misinformed and overly aggressive people. “I think it was actually okay in the beginning even helpful. But man it really has gone off the rails.”“That’s why we’re pulling the plug right now before it gets any worse” Tibbs added.Speaking to reporters individuals across the globe cited social media as perhaps the internet’s most problematic component having wrongly assumed it was wise to allow people to share their opinions via a tool that generously rewards whoever makes the most shocking and abhorrent statements most frequently.But the populace also observed that the internet originally designed as a way for research institutions to share data was now largely a repository of sponsored content pop-up ads movies no one will ever watch spam elaborate identity theft schemes bank accounts vulnerable to hacking middle-aged men badly covering Aerosmith on YouTube futile online petitions grossly embellished OkCupid profiles spyware fan-generated Lord Of The Rings erotica celebrity gossip anti-Semitic memes revenge porn deceptive apartment listings and death threats.“The internet is horrible—there’s so much of this thing that people just shouldn’t be using at all” said Graham Curtis a 52-year-old Dublin Ireland resident. “I think the original idea was that you’d log on and express a viewpoint and then someone else would express theirs. Then some kind of semi-constructive dialogue would take place. Instead you go online and someone almost immediately tells you he’d laugh so hard if you offed yourself.” “I’m glad we’re taking it down and if it ever gets put back up hopefully there will be some kind of quality control” he added. “If you’re using the internet just to tell me what your 10 favorite Amy Adams movies are and not even in any particular order then maybe you shouldn’t be using it at all.”Across the world discussions have taken place as to how the internet if it is one day revived could be made less appalling. Several guidelines have reportedly been proposed including a minimum age requirement and a questionnaire aimed at identifying the most frivolous or virulent users and then either barring them entirely or corralling them inside a section of the internet dedicated to people who do nothing but make humanity worse.While access to email and online weather services would remain largely unchanged sources confirmed that Reddit and 4chan would be eliminated entirely and the internet would be strictly limited to a single reliable database of song lyrics.“We can put the internet back up eventually but right now we need to take a step back and really think about what we want from it” said Devansh Patel 27 of Chennai India. “Linking networks of computers to facilitate the free exchange of ideas was great in theory but it just hasn’t produced anything of merit. I still think it has potential though and with any luck we can bring it back in my lifetime.”“Nevertheless I think everyone agrees the next internet should contain only factual information” he continued. “I’m not sure why they didn’t think of that in the first place.”

Another 4 percent reportedly skittered away beneath a baseboard crevice before answering any questions.The survey also noted an unusually dramatic shift in cockroach attitudes in just the past year with optimism about the planet’s future plummeting after the Paris climate agreement was signed last April but then suddenly rebounding to an all-time high by the second week in November.“Even though progress hasn’t always been smooth I’m more and more confident that the planet is on the right track and that roaches are going to be okay” said a 7-week-old German cockroach from a Minneapolis-area pile of decaying leaves. “And don’t forget this just doesn’t happen on its own. It’s because of the prudent decisions that are being made by world leaders as we speak.”“They have my complete faith” he added. “I know they’ll do what’s best for us.”

If it begins to look like it’s dying try to feed it or hydrate it or help it in some other way until it looks like it’s not dying anymore.”“It doesn’t matter if it’s a lizard a bat a muskrat or a fish” she continued. “At this point we’re asking you to protect literally any animal you come across.”Soto emphasized that humans no longer have time to pick and choose which species they wish to preserve and their only remaining hope is to direct their efforts toward saving whatever creatures happen to be nearby whether that means running into their own backyard and scooping up a squirrel picking up ants beetles and other insects they may spot on the sidewalk or stopping their car running out to grab a Canada goose from the roadside and pulling it to warmth and safety in the backseat of their vehicle. Officials from the World Wildlife Fund further pleaded with citizens to use whatever makeshift means they have at their disposal to keep the animals from perishing underscoring their point by noting that some marine creatures—including frogs beavers trout and small- to medium-sized sharks—can be kept in one’s bathtub and that anyone with a spare bedroom could be using it to protect a family of groundhogs a colony of bees or a single large animal such as a bison or panther.“If you happen to be looking at an animal right at this moment please stop listening to me and go help that animal continue living” said Soto who noted that many animals could be fed basic household food items but added that it would be wise to consult the internet to determine if the particular species in one’s possession has strict dietary requirements. “To be honest you don’t even really have to keep it all that healthy—alive is good enough. As long as it keeps taking breaths that’s a good thing. We’re really not that picky at this point.”“And frankly it doesn’t even have to be an animal” she added. “If you’re able to grab a small plant or some grass and help it survive that’s great too.”Sources confirmed that Soto then abruptly ended her remarks mid-sentence rushed out of the briefing room and onto the adjacent courtyard and lunged headlong toward a perched sparrow.
2016-12-12T11:58:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/the-onion-s-2016-fish-of-the-year-is-this-fish-1819579494,The Onion’s 2016 Fish Of The Year Is…This Fish,Every 12 months the editorial board of this newspaper convenes to select the recipient of our highest annual honor and indeed one of the most esteemed and renowned prizes in the world of journalism: The Onion’s Fish of the Year. The members of our selection committee do not take such a task lightly and this year as in all others they closely and carefully evaluated the many available candidates on a wide variety of criteria respecting the full weight of the accolade they were entrusted to bestow. Sometimes our honoree is chosen based on its prominence in that year’s news cycle. Other times a Fish of the Year is selected because of its ability to inspire or to bring about meaningful change. This year The Onion’s editors began their deliberations by asking one simple question: Which fish among all others embodied the tone and spirit of 2016 as no other fish could? The answer was unequivocal.That’s why for the year 2016 The Onion’s Fish of the Year is this fish.While at 6 inches and 12 ounces this axillary bream might seem at first an unassuming choice it’s this fish’s quiet dignity and resilience in the face of aquatic turbidity that secured its spot as this year’s most influential. Indeed on matters of filter feeding scale luster and avoiding predation this freshwater fish clearly stood above all others.It should be known that our editorial board made its decision well aware that it was likely to be controversial. When selecting a single winner out of trillions of potential candidates one could argue that any choice is bound to incite heated debate. Some will no doubt argue that this year’s winner is a repeat of 1954’s contentious Fish of the Year selection when The Onion chose a relatively unknown haddock over a much more prominent 140-pound wels catfish. Others may even find this year’s winner as divisive as our bold and conceptual selection in 2006 when we notably named You The Reader as the recipient of our annual award.However our selection committee is confident in its choice. After evaluating individuals from over 30000 fish species on categories ranging from swimming speed to extent of spawning territory to ability to survive in varying currents and water temperatures it is our newspaper’s position that there was no other viable option. For many Americans when they think of 2016 they think of this fish.For those still unconvinced the editorial board would like to make it known that there is ample precedent for this decision. Consider our famous 1960 pick of an Arctic char as a compromise choice in a crowded and divided field of candidates or our 1974 selection of a basa fish that so well captured the paranoia and suspicion of the post-Watergate era. Now as then there were many excellent alternate choices including a northern pike and an unidentified silver-and-yellow fish that we briefly spotted off the southern tip of New Zealand. But when placed head-to-head with other contenders our winner proved itself again and again most notably with its ability to live in waters from West Africa to Northern Europe its tendency to grow to 7 to 9 inches in length and its maximum lifespan of 18 years.In short we believe the choice of this fish speaks for itself.Of course that doesn’t mean this fish is without fault—in fact there is much about it to criticize. Nor does naming it Fish of the Year mean that we support everything this fish stands for. Take for example its refusal to swim below a depth of 30 feet which our editorial board disagrees with sharply. But ever since we began choosing a Fish of the Year with our selection of a flathead grey mullet in 1926 our vow has been to “choose that fish which has most defined the events and character of that year regardless of its moral standing.”It is our opinion that this year’s fish honors and upholds this grand tradition. And indeed in these trying and uncertain times this exemplary bream stands as a noble example of the type of fish we can all admire if not aspire to ourselves.
2016-12-07T13:20:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/scientists-make-discovery-about-world-s-silt-deposits-b-1819579489,Scientists Make Discovery About World’s Silt Deposits But Understand If You Aren’t Interested In That,‘We’re Excited About This But Silt Research Certainly Isn’t For Everyone’ Say GeologistsBOULDER CO—A team of geologists from the University of Colorado announced at a press conference Wednesday that they had made a significant discovery concerning the world’s silt deposits but stated that they understand if you aren’t interested in that sort of thing.The consortium of silt experts—who acknowledged that the analysis of the loose sedimentary material that gathers in lakes rivers and forests was not necessarily up everyone’s alley—nonetheless stressed that the results of their research had wide-reaching implications for those in their specific field of study.“We’ve made quite a substantial breakthrough in our understanding of how slope stability is impacted by the silt composition in different layers of alluvial soil but of course I’m well aware that isn’t everybody’s thing” said study director Stephen Powell who admitted that investigating the movement of silt was after all a relatively niche field so he certainly didn’t begrudge anyone who is not as excited as he is by such research. “If it piques your interest that’s great. If it doesn’t that’s no problem either. So I’m just going to put our findings out there and you can decide for yourself if this is something that you’d like to know more about: In some regions of northern Colorado the silt fraction is actually dominated by coarse silt versus middle or fine silt.”“We were surprised and intrigued to learn that and perhaps you are as well” Powell continued. “That being said if you don’t want to learn about silt that’s perfectly reasonable too. Really not a big deal to us.”With plans to publish the findings in the Journal Of Sedimentary Research the scientists said that while their study had garnered a wealth of new information relevant to those who are passionate about topics like loess strata clay content and rock weathering they would not blame anyone for deciding that dozens of pages about silt was much more than they would care to read.Citing their methodology which included field mapping drilling and shear strength measurements the research team suggested that perhaps the average person might at least appreciate the processes by which the data was collected. But they also raised the possibility that one may not have any special affinity for soil analysis at all and would prefer skipping the research altogether.The geologists added that either scenario was fine with them.“I’ve been a researcher and professor of sedimentary geology for the past 35 years at one of the region’s top public universities so am I going to be thrilled when there’s a major development in the area of silt? You bet” said Powell speaking in front of a projection of the first slide of his team’s presentation which read “The Mechanical Properties Of Quaternary Sediment And Their Impact On Slope Dynamics: Not For Everyone.” “That’s just who I am. I find the way silt forms on the earth’s surface fascinating. Silt erosion; silt lattices; the chemical breakdown of silt—these are all things I think about on a daily basis. When I attend conferences I regularly speak on these matters and how they relate to the broader spectrum of soils in general. In other words I like silt. However our intention here isn’t to force anyone to share my enthusiasm about silt. Not in the least.”“After all it’s silt” he continued. “I get that.”Recognizing the lay reader’s possible hesitation the scientists proposed that it might be worth just flipping through the report to see if anything catches their eye adding that there was “actually some pretty interesting stuff in there” on how silt layers are deposited when subject to periglacial processes.Yet researchers were quick to note that if it sounded like they were trying to sell you on silt that’s really not how it was meant to come across at all.“Let me say it as simply as I can: This is a discovery about a granular sediment whose primary audience is other academics in the field” Powell said. “So yes I readily admit my excitement about verifying that the stability of slopes exceeding 27 degrees is controlled by five distinct phases of slope formation each corresponding to a different sedimentary profile. But then again silt research is of personal interest to me. No one’s holding your feet to the fire and saying you have to feel the same way I do about silt.”Added Powell “On the other hand though we have a report about shale coming out next month that’s going to blow your goddamn mind.”
2016-12-07T09:13:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/city-of-chicago-working-around-clock-to-clear-18-inches-1819579485,City Of Chicago Working Around Clock To Clear 18 Inches Of Bullet Casings From Streets,CHICAGO—Promising that every effort would be made to limit the impact on residents’ day-to-day lives Chicago officials announced Wednesday that a fleet of plows was working around the clock to clear more than 18 inches of fresh bullet casings that had blanketed the metropolitan area overnight.Sources at the city’s Department of Streets and Sanitation confirmed that over 250 ammunition-removal vehicles had been deployed to deal with the knee-deep layer of spent cartridges which have been steadily accumulating on Chicago’s streets alleys and pedestrian walkways since the previous evening.“Our crews have been out there all night trying to make our roadways passable but given how quickly the handgun and semi-automatic shells have piled up it’s going to take some time” DSS commissioner Charles L. Williams told reporters thanking the public for its patience while crews made their way across the stricken municipality. “We’re making good headway but as you can imagine it’s not an easy job especially with casings continuing to fall throughout the city.”“So unless you have an emergency we’re urging all citizens to stay put for the time being” he added. “Right now it’s just not safe to be out in such treacherous conditions.”Williams stated that as casing levels surpassed 12 inches scores of extra workers from outside the city were called in to help keep pace with the buildup. In addition numerous dump truck crews have reportedly been tasked with carting off entire trailers full of cartridges from the hardest-hit areas and depositing them in nearby landfills before circling back to pick up more.According to sources by the morning rush hour over 300 public and private schools in the Chicago area had been either closed or delayed due to concerns over the large amounts of ammunition covering the city. Citing increased hazards officials further advised residents to stay off back streets and avoid venturing out at night.“Man it’s brutal out there” said Paul Bergeron 34 a resident of the Lawndale neighborhood on Chicago’s West Side showing reporters where plows had piled up over nine feet of empty casings in the parking lot of the grocery store across from his apartment. “I ran out to Walgreens and on my way back I nearly took a spill trudging through all the .40-caliber shells—I just wanted to get home as quickly as possible.”“Growing up in Kansas I never saw anything nearly like this but it is what it is” he continued. “When you’re living here you learn to deal with the bullets and adjust your life accordingly.”Some locals however have complained that the areas receiving priority attention from the city’s plows were not consistent with those that had been most severely affected. In Chicago’s western and southern neighborhoods for example eyewitnesses reported that cartridges had risen as high as some first-floor windows making it difficult for the occupants to even open their front doors.“The plows always seem to get to the rich neighborhoods first that’s for sure” said Gloria Hawkins 53 a lifelong resident of the South Side community of Auburn Gresham. “Down here you have no choice but to go out there into the ammo and shovel your car out yourself. It can be pretty frustrating when things are really bad out because by the time you finish clearing the walk in front of your house there’s already an inch or two of fresh bullet casings piling up where you started.”“But we’ll get through it just like we always do” Hawkins continued. “This city is very much used to this sort of thing.”
2016-11-21T12:11:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/historians-piece-together-carnival-east-india-company-s-1819579469,Historians Piece Together Carnival East India Company’s First Cruise In 1605,LONDON—Working from recently discovered ships’ logs and archaeological findings a team of historians announced Monday they had pieced together a detailed account of the Carnival East India Company’s maiden cruise—the very first seafaring journey to the Far East dedicated solely to the enjoyment and entertainment of its passengers.According to records the 175-foot 1400-ton sailing ship—christened the H.M.S. Sunshine—embarked from London in February 1605 on the first-ever “Expedition under-tak’n on behalfe of Plea-sure” as it is referred to in writings from the time with an itinerary that included stops in Ceylon Malay Nieuw-Guinea and various tropical locales in the South China Sea. “The Carnival East India Company was the first joint-stock cruise line to offer recreational voyages beyond the Cape of Good Hope and was widely popular among 17th-century English citizens for its all-inclusive packages that covered the costs of passengers’ lodging meals and leech treatments” said Dr. Henry Carter a leading maritime historian at Cambridge University who headed up the six-year investigation into the voyage after locating the company’s long-forgotten Royal Charter for the “Cultivation and Discoverance of all Manner of MARI-TIME LEISURE that GOD may deem Fit & Suitable” in the university’s archives. “The 110-week excursion offered people who could afford to let their fields lie fallow for two years a way to reduce the stress caused by a lifetime of toil and plague.”“Primary sources suggest that the one-third of passengers who were not taken captive by mercenaries or impressed into naval service had the time of their lives” he added “at least until they succumbed to dysentery.”Carter noted that newly unearthed sketches of the ship indicate that the H.M.S. Sunshine was outfitted with a variety of unique features including long communal troughs of hardtack gruel and grog which were available belowdecks at any time of day or night and a large recreational wooden slide moistened with water pumped from the bilge.Additionally broadsheet advertisements leading up to the cruise enticed passengers with the opportunity to “gorge upon the vaste Allot-ment of FOODE ’til one’s Appetite be SLAKED and thereupon LIE-ABOUT above-decks and becomme redden’d unto the Duyvil Him-self in the boyling SUN.”Beyond its promise of general leisure the ship is known to have offered several scheduled entertainment options the most popular of which was the nightly opportunity to have clergymen flagellate any passengers who believed they deserved punishment for their idleness frivolity or other mortal sins. In addition it is believed that voyagers could disembark at various ports of call to gawk at “savages” and buy small satchels of spices indigo dyes jade or opium.“Several surviving written accounts of the voyage mention that by far the most popular diversion on the H.M.S. Sunshine was a kindly Italian magician named Giuseppe who performed a simple cup-and-ball routine and was adored by the children on the ship” Carter said. “In fact many aboard expressed regret when after roughly 48 hours at sea Giuseppe was burned alive on the main deck by a mob of passengers who had charged him with the crime of witchcraft.”Much of what is known about the ship’s onboard amenities reportedly comes from a journal kept by Myhil Osborne a member of England’s landed gentry who at 41 years of age was one of the ship’s few elderly passengers. In his writings he raved about “lodgings of gen’rous measure” in which only 20 to 30 people were bunked in an 8-by-10-foot cabin as opposed to the roughly 80 passengers housed in identically sized quarters in steerage.“I am a full Fort-night into my Sojourne but only thryce yet have I beene poisen’d unto vomitous Bile and runny-ing Feculence by somme be-fouled Pottage or badly salt’d Meate” Osborne wrote in praise of his experience aboard the H.M.S. Sunshine’s maiden voyage. “Verily not Two-Score Deathes have I witness’d of late and those mere Cases of Scurvy Drowning Dæmon possession Grippe Mariner’s Palsy or Childe-birth.”Subsequent Carnival East India cruises did not fare as well according to researchers. Pirate attacks were reportedly common as were wrecks in which all hands were lost often when a ship attempted to anchor off dangerous reef-ringed coastlines in search of tax-free gold. “At one point the Carnival East India Company actually laid claim to an entire 2400-acre island intended as a private retreat for its passengers” said Carter referring to a remote desert isle in a then-uncharted region off the coast of Siam. “However years of cannibal attacks eventually forced the company to abandon it.”The wreck of the H.M.S. Sunshine now lies somewhere just east of the Seychelles where historical accounts confirm it sank in 1613 after the ship’s crew mutinied and purposely capsized the vessel to avoid hearing another set by the ship’s dueling harpsichord players.
2016-11-16T14:35:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/deep-sea-godiva-rig-taps-world-s-largest-offshore-ganac-1819579452,Deep-Sea Godiva Rig Taps World’s Largest Offshore Ganache Deposit,BRUSSELS—Hailing the effort as their most promising confectionary-extraction project to date Godiva executives held a press conference Wednesday to announce that one of their deep-sea rigs had successfully tapped the world’s largest known offshore ganache deposit. According to the multinational chocolatier its fixed platform rig Dark Decadence 7 has begun pumping ganache from deep below the ocean having bored through the earth’s graham-cracker crust to access a 16-mile-wide undersea reservoir of the chocolaty glaze located off the coast of Belgium.“Sonar analysis confirms this previously untapped reserve contains approximately 800 billion morsels in total recoverable ganache which would make it far larger than any other deposit yet discovered and almost twice as large as the Cocoa Sands of Western Canada” said Godiva CEO Mohamed Elsarky dismissing investors’ worries that surpluses of the rich creamy filling could create a glut that wreaks havoc upon the international market for delectable treats. “As global demand increases building up ganache stockpiles is the only way to stabilize truffle prices particularly as developing countries continue to grow and invest heavily in dessert.”“Thanks to this new source we believe the retail cost of cherry cordials could be kept as low as $5 per box throughout the holiday season” Elsarky added. “This is encouraging news for the billions of sweet tooths worldwide who rely on this crucial substance every day.”According to Godiva the deposit contains a light sweet ganache suitable for infusion into milk chocolate medallions and Aztec Spice truffles. Company officials confirmed that tanker trucks will transport the crude candy to an inland refinery where it will be stripped of any lingering almond or hazelnut impurities that it may have acquired from being pumped upward through thousands of feet of compressed nougat and marzipan layers. It will then reportedly be processed to anywhere from 55 to 90 percent dark for a variety of industrial applications ranging from cake drizzling to strawberry dipping.The finished product will be shipped to North American markets aboard a fleet of chocolate supertankers that can hold up to 84 million bonbons’ worth of ganache company officials said and it will reach confectioners as far east as Moscow thanks to the recently reopened Trans-Eurasian Ganache Pipeline.Champions of opening up offshore deposits to drilling have argued it reduces the dependence of Western nations on foreign ganache much of which comes from countries that have dubious human rights records and are controlled by corrupt leaders whose ruthless regimes and lavish lifestyles are bankrolled by massive ganache wealth.“With the tapping of this offshore ganache deposit Godiva is also helping the industry move away from outdated practices such as fudge mining which yields a much cruder dirtier form of chocolate” said Elsarky who went on to cite well-documented worker safety hazards such as deadly fudge cave-ins and the slow-acting but often fatal cocoa lung. “Not only is deep-sea drilling safer than subterranean fudge mining and chocolate mountaintop removal but it’s also more cost-effective as it produces a consistently indulgent product with uniform cocoa butter crystals throughout.”Godiva which paid a reported $15 million for its lease on the North Sea chocolate shelf was quick to downplay criticisms of offshore drilling a technique that carries with it the risk of deadly ganache rig explosions as well as catastrophic icing slicks that often leave local marine life coated in thick velvety-smooth layers of chocolate sauce. “There is always a very slight possibility that a ganache well will blow out but we at Godiva have worked tirelessly to ensure our industry never experiences another Ghirardelli Bittersweet disaster” spokesperson Marta Willis said in reference to the 2008 chocolate spill that killed 16 and dumped more than 10 million tablespoons of raw cacao into the San Francisco Bay over the course of 73 days. “Our updated safety protocols include triple-sealed valves that prevent all dark and semisweet glazes from flowing out of the rig’s borehole to the surface.” “And in the absolute worst-case scenario of a leak we have the ability to cap our well with an airtight seal of macadamia clusters and caramel” she added. At press time more than 300 top scientists had signed a letter condemning Godiva and advocating for alternative sweets such as small handfuls of fruit and an occasional dash of cinnamon.

Silver is said to have rammed his vehicle into a patrol car during his attempt to evade authorities before trying to escape on foot with as many national and state-level opinion polls as he could carry at which time he was shot repeatedly by multiple officers.Silver was pronounced dead at the scene shortly thereafter.“Upon initial contact border agents found Mr. Silver to be acting erratically and noticed what appeared to be a large quantity of materials concealed under a blanket in his backseat” said Division Chief David Stefans. “When instructed to pull his vehicle to the side for further inspection Silver abruptly accelerated forward and crashed through a barrier leaving agents with no choice but to discharge their weapons. A subsequent search of the scene yielded over 20 months’ worth of surveys of likely voters election models and long-term electoral forecasts concealed in numerous places throughout the vehicle.”“We can verify at this time that Mr. Silver was in possession of every piece of U.S. polling information dating back to last spring when he attempted to flee the country” Stefans added. Officials stated that in addition to the thousands of presidential election polls found strewn about Silver’s 1984 Oldsmobile 98 following the incident investigators discovered hundreds of weighted congressional forecasts hidden within the car’s wheel wells. The entirety of Silver’s polls-only and polls-plus forecasts since the beginning of the primaries were also reportedly discovered inside the car’s hollowed-out speaker system.“After he sideswiped a barricade his trunk popped open and all these Zogby and Pew surveys came flying out all over the road” said long-haul trucker Ernesto Nunez who described watching Silver struggle out of his wrecked vehicle still clutching an armful of high-sample-size phone and online opinion polls. “Even after they struck him a couple times you could see he was still trying to hold onto as many A-plus–rated surveys as he could.”“He might have made it too if he’d just dumped all the Monmouth University tracking polls on the ground and made a quick break for the Rio Grande” Nunez added.According to authorities a posthumous search of Silver’s person also found a stash of bullet-ridden Ciruli Associates and ABC News/Washington Post polls duct-taped to his legs and abdomen. While officials refused to speculate on the matter they noted that an autopsy would be conducted in the next several days to determine if the statistician had ingested any further polling data or secreted it in any of his orifices for transport across the border.“We thought we’d removed every poll from the vehicle after we pried open the glove compartment and found all the Rasmussens he’d stuffed under there but then we cut open the upholstery of the seats and realized he’d packed them full of swing state demographic analyses” said Border Patrol agent Paul Vasquez. “It wasn’t until we had the K-9 unit go through the vehicle that we discovered Silver was actually using a false bottom under the car’s chassis to smuggle every candidate favorability rating since Ted Cruz announced he was running for the presidency. This guy was thorough.”“We hate to use deadly force but we’re incredibly lucky we stopped him when we did” Vasquez continued. “Mr. Silver could have left our country with absolutely no polling numbers no electoral projections and no approval ratings just days before the election.”
2016-10-27T09:18:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/psychologists-say-it-perfectly-natural-to-fantasize-abo-1819579393,Psychologists Say It Perfectly Natural To Fantasize About Sandwiches Other Than One Currently In Hand,BOULDER CO—Saying such feelings of desire were observed in nearly every individual they studied psychologists from the University of Colorado released a report Thursday concluding that it is perfectly natural for people to fantasize about sandwiches other than the one presently in their hands.The study which surveyed more than 500 adults from a variety of socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds determined that 89 percent of subjects had at least once during the previous six months vividly imagined a different sandwich while sitting down at the table with their current hero hoagie or po’ boy.“While many people may find it distressing or shameful when they begin mentally picturing a sandwich that’s nothing like the one they are holding our findings suggest that these thoughts are in fact a completely normal biological impulse” said Dr. Kelly Sohn the report’s lead author. “You should by no means feel any sense of regret or embarrassment if you suddenly find yourself mid-bite feeling curious about a particularly striking BLT that caught your eye while you were walking by a café earlier that day or letting your thoughts drift to a pastrami on rye you used to have in college.”“Even if you’re completely satisfied with the sandwich sitting right in front of you it is purely an instinctual response to become overwhelmed by a strong desire to taste one that’s very different” Sohn added. “It’s just human nature.”According to the research team it is particularly common for individuals to indulge in fantasies about exotic sandwiches from foreign culinary traditions like Cubans or Vietnamese bánh mìs that they have never tried before. Additionally Sohn said that many subjects reported finding themselves particularly drawn to bigger beefier sandwiches or those with larger meatballs often causing them to imagine these alluring features on their own plainer sandwich when they later sit down for a meal.Researchers also explained that on average a person imagines a different sandwich than the one they’re currently holding about once every week though a sizable minority of respondents reportedly acknowledged engaging in such fantasies every single time they had lunch.“It’s important to remember that mentally picturing a piled-high Reuben when you’re eating the same chicken salad sandwich you always get is by and large the product of reflexive brain activity over which you have very little control” said Sohn adding that Americans are constantly bombarded with images of picture-perfect subs and idealized pulled pork sandwiches on billboards and television further explaining the ubiquity of the phenomenon. “In fact we found that when people are able to unlearn the guilt that is often associated with these harmless fantasies it can actually make the enjoyment of one’s own sandwich that much more satisfying.”“The real danger lies in unnecessarily punishing oneself for these thoughts which can eventually diminish the gratification one derives from eating sandwiches altogether” she continued.Sohn further assured the public that it was normal for such fantasies to become extremely vivid and complex. In particular she noted that 63 percent of subjects had reported that on one or more occasions they had imagined themselves eating their desired sandwich in an uncommon location such as in a car aboard a plane or even in front of other people in public.Experts also confirmed that more atypical fantasies such as eating a sandwich in a hot tub or devouring two sandwiches at once were in most cases perfectly normal as well.“It’s such a relief to know I’m not some weirdo or a bad person for checking out my brother’s spicy Italian when we went out to lunch a few weeks ago—I felt so guilty about that” said 42-year-old study participant Craig Worsley who told reporters he couldn’t help but imagine sinking his teeth into the sandwich’s thick layers of salami capicola and provolone until tangy vinaigrette dribbled all down his chin. “Don’t get me wrong I liked the patty melt I ordered just fine but man I looked at his sandwich and couldn’t help but think ‘Damn that thing is stacked.’”Added Worsley “But now I understand I’m just like any other person out there with a normal healthy appetite.”Researchers stated that a small percentage of deeply troubled individuals reported fantasizing about salads while eating their sandwiches and recommended that anyone experiencing these types of perverse abnormal thoughts immediately seek psychological counseling.

According to the startup’s founders their work will forever change the way people think about and interact with the thing.Fiske who reportedly began his career working solely with the other thing but soon realized that adding technology to what he was doing would “open amazing new doors for the thing” told reporters that his company has an incredible opportunity to revolutionize both technology and the other thing. Five years from now he said the thing is likely to be completely unrecognizable by today’s standards.He pointed out that Intuihub is already disrupting the entire landscape by using technology to make the other thing more accessible and convenient.“Technology is evolving and the other thing needs to evolve along with it” said Fiske noting that no other company focusing on the other thing is using technology the way Intuihub is. “The synergy between technology and this thing will be so strong that when the two come together they may actually create a third thing one that we believe could be truly world-altering.”After describing their plans to launch a revolution that will change the lives of millions for the better Intuihub founders confirmed they were also interested in partnering with brands to create more personalized experiences for the thing’s consumers.

Trump made unwanted sexual advances on them. Each of these accusers has operated seemingly in collusion with the sole intention of spreading outrageous falsehoods to undermine a man of great esteem and resources. Not only has this rank slander dealt a grievous blow to Mr. Trump’s reputation but the words of these women have stained America’s legacy of fair and respectable electoral politics and we at this newspaper can no longer stand idly by while such brazen and criminal defamation goes unpunished. It is with this in mind that the editorial board of The Onion has unanimously voted with all due humility to offer up our offices to imprison the women who have wrongfully assailed Mr. Trump’s honor and good name.We urge the public to recall that Mr. Trump is not only a globally successful businessman with a net worth in the billions of dollars but also an aspirant to this nation’s highest office. As such these accusations—all of them libelous and wildly defamatory—stand to profoundly erode his stature in the public eye at this critical juncture in the election cycle which is why those responsible must be made an example of. Moving with all due haste to incarcerate these women within The Onion’s detention cells would in our opinion put a swift and resounding end to their present smear campaign and further act to dissuade future maligners from coming forward.Indeed even if Mr. Trump did commit an act or two of those which he has been accused shouldn’t his immense prestige give him license to make a mistake here or there without it tarnishing his character and jeopardizing his chances at elected office? The editorial board of this newspaper has taken the liberty of readying a private security unit to find these women wherever they may be hiding apprehend them with all necessary force and remove them from the society that they through their cowardly actions have forfeited their right to be a part of. We ask only for the assent of Mr. Trump himself.We recognize that the Trump campaign may have questions about The Onion’s prison facilities and whether the conditions within them will be sufficiently isolating and punitive in light of the egregious character assaults these women have leveled against the Republican candidate. The editors of this newspaper would like to assure Mr. Trump and his staff that The Onion takes incarceration very seriously. Indeed our detainment complex is recognized as one of the world’s premier black sites for extraordinary rendition by many foreign intelligence agencies and we presently confine hundreds of dissidents and activists on behalf of our government partners in North Korea Saudi Arabia Myanmar and elsewhere.Allow us to further assuage any doubts by elaborating on the conditions these liars and conspirators can expect while imprisoned within our headquarters:If the potential for escape is a reason for concern Mr. Trump rest assured that The Onion has operated private correctional facilities since the Spanish-American War when we successfully detained the most violent and wily of Spaniards and not a single prison break has ever been successfully orchestrated from our confines. For more than 100 years The Onion’s prisons have held the most cunning inmates ranging from French traitor Alfred Dreyfus to the seditious operatives exposed by Sen. Joseph McCarthy to Salman Rushdie. We would warmly welcome the addition of these women who have so contemptibly borne false witness against a political standard-bearer and American icon.Indeed even if Mr. Trump did commit an act or two of those which he has been accused shouldn’t his immense prestige give him license to make a mistake here or there without it tarnishing his character and jeopardizing his chances at elected office? We most certainly believe so.It is The Onion’s firm conviction that in order for civility in our republic to endure those seeking to lead the people must be freed from fear of scurrilous aspersions that threaten the very governance of our nation. Only through vigilant prosecution and punishment of those responsible for impugning Donald J. Trump’s character can we secure this noble aim. Anything less would be a dishonor to the very tenets upon which this newspaper was founded.Mr. Trump we await your permission to incarcerate these deceitful women. It would be our distinct privilege.

According to reports Bo who had become separated from his companion earlier in the day when he slid into a ravine was cornered by the predator against a large tree trunk and seemed to have no means of escape until Sunny having seemingly appeared out of nowhere came rushing to his aid at the last possible second. “Bo get out of the way!” said Sunny her teeth bared and her fur bristling as she lunged toward the menacing cougar ultimately scaring it back into the forest. “That’s right! Run away you coward! Nobody’s going to hurt my friend while I’m around!”“Don’t worry Bo” she added. “You’re safe now.”Administration officials said the two Portuguese water dogs were mistakenly left in Yellowstone by the vacationing Obamas who returned home believing Sunny and Bo had been loaded aboard Air Force One never realizing the pair had scampered off the tarmac and into the woods moments before takeoff to chase a squirrel. It is believed that the dogs later returned to the spot where they had last scented Barack Michelle Malia and Sasha Obama and after sitting patiently overnight until realizing the family was not going to return decided to find their way back to Washington D.C. on their own beginning a 2000-mile journey eastward.The first pets reportedly spent the next few days bounding over mountain passes and wading through rocky streams from which Bo would after several fruitless attempts emerge with a fish in his mouth providing much-needed sustenance to the pair who were accustomed to being fed nutritious meals at regular intervals by their White House handlers. Early on in their trek Sunny and Bo are said to have encountered several hikers they thought might rescue them. However the group turned out to be German tourists who reportedly failing to recognize the presidential seal on the dogs’ collars simply pet them fed them some dried fruit and continued on their way. “What do you think they’re eating at the state dinner tonight?” Bo asked a tired disinterested Sunny as the two crouched inside a hollow tree trunk where they had been forced to take shelter during a particularly fierce storm. “I bet they’re having steak. Oh man I can almost taste it now. That’s my absolute favorite. Do you think Malia is saving her leftovers for me? I bet she is.”“I miss Washington” Bo continued. “We’ll be back home soon though right?”According to sources rarely a day of their adventure went by without the two dogs getting into a precarious situation that required them to rely on each other to get through. At one point after traveling for a day without water Sunny reportedly came upon a rushing river and in her eagerness to take a drink slipped on a rock fell in and was swept away by the powerful current. Bo is believed to have reached the river’s edge just in time to see Sunny’s head pop up and disappear around the bend. With neither dog having much swimming experience outside the White House pool sources said a quick-thinking Bo ran downstream as fast as he could grabbed one end of a long stick in his jaws extended it out over the water had Sunny bite down on the other end and managed to pull her to safety just before she would have plunged over a waterfall.Several weeks later sources reported that a curious Bo followed an unusual scent into a hollow log lying on its side in the Black Hills only to come scrambling out moments later pursued by a slowly ambling porcupine. Bo is said to have spent the rest of the evening whimpering as Sunny carefully removed the quills stuck in her companion’s muzzle using her teeth at one point pausing to say “You have to go and stick your nose in everything don’t you?”Cold and hungry as they crossed through barren wintry terrain the first dogs were reportedly found trudging through chest-deep snow by a kindly old man who let them stay for a time in his small and humble cabin surroundings that were far removed from the accommodations that Sunny who was purchased from a professional breeder and Bo who was a gift from the late Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-MA) were used to. According to reports the old man allowed the pair to join his team of sled dogs who initially bullied the White House pets for their pampered backgrounds.“You call yourselves dogs do you?” said Avalanche a hulking husky and the lead dog on the old man’s sled team. “Something tells me you’ve had everything in life handed to you on a silver dog dish. That may be the way things work in Washington D.C. but around here we have to earn our keep. This is no place for lapdogs.”Later sources stated Sunny and Bo earned the respect of that same dog when they worked together to save several members of the sled team who had fallen through a patch of thin ice during a routine supply run.Unbeknownst to the pair as they made their way across the country the Obamas were said to be desperately trying to locate the pets they missed so much. According to sources Sasha and Malia Obama put up flyers all around the nation’s capital and asked every congressman they encountered to keep an eye out for the dogs in their home districts. Reports indicate that Sasha also went to bed each night looking at an old photo of her beloved pets promising aloud that they would all be reunited one day.As the first dogs passed through the Midwest on their trek homeward they reportedly came upon a small city where much to their delight they heard the unmistakable sound of their owner’s voice. Barking excitedly as they ran toward it they are believed to have rounded a corner only to discover President Obama giving a speech on the screen of a television in an electronics store. Reports confirmed the pair having caused quite a commotion were then chased down the block by the town’s dogcatcher escaping only after Bo bit the man on the seat of his pants causing him to yelp in pain and exposing his heart-patterned boxer shorts to passersby beneath the flap of torn fabric.Some days later Sunny and Bo appeared ready to give up having convinced themselves they would never again sniff fresh tomatoes from Michelle Obama’s vegetable garden or receive one of Treasury Secretary Jack Lew’s signature belly rubs. Deciding they were simply too tired and demoralized to continue onward the pair are said to have stopped to sleep for the night in the bed of a beat-up old pickup truck. Sources said they were jarred awake in the morning when the engine roared to life and the pickup lurched out onto the highway.After initially panicking when they realized they were being driven to an unknown destination the two dogs reportedly soon found themselves enjoying the breeze rushing through their fur and the vast stretches of ground they were quickly covering. Several hours later the dogs are said to have smelled something familiar perking their heads up over the tailgate and then howling in delight when they saw trees filled with pink cherry blossoms growing denser around them.“Wait a second I recognize those barks” said President Obama interrupting his introduction of a judicial nominee at a Rose Garden press conference to discover the dogs bounding across the South Lawn toward him. “Quick get Sasha and Malia! Oh my goodness! Where on earth have you rascals been?”“Everyone get out here!” he continued embracing Sunny and Bo as they eagerly licked his face and the first family came running to welcome them home. “They’re back!”At press time Michelle Obama was reportedly rolling her eyes and saying “I guess everything’s back to normal” as the family sat down for their first meal together since their reunion and heard the unmistakable sound of Bo lapping water from an East Wing toilet.
2016-10-13T14:07:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/subway-breeding-program-successfully-creates-black-fore-1819579347,Subway Breeding Program Successfully Creates Black Forest Ham–Meatball Marinara Hybrid,MILFORD CT—Announcing the creation of a genetically viable new menu item they said could soon appear in franchises nationwide researchers with Subway’s sandwich breeding program revealed Thursday they had successfully developed a Black Forest Ham–Meatball Marinara hybrid.The footlong sub which company officials say was selectively bred to incorporate the zesty traits of the Meatball Marinara bloodline with the natural smokiness of the Black Forest Ham genus was unveiled at a press conference at Subway’s main sandwich breeding and husbandry facility within its corporate headquarters.“It’s taken over six years of genomic research and countless breeding attempts but I’m happy to report that we’ve produced a robust new offspring from two of our most delicious subs” said Noah Plattner director of Subway’s sandwich breeding division adding that the hybrid was morphologically compatible with any of the chain’s nine bread options. “This was a group effort that required the skills of our professional handlers technicians and fertility experts all of whom worked without rest to produce this perfectly bred combination of succulent ham fresh vegetables and tangy marinara sauce.”“Everyone involved in the creation of S-74G—or the Black Forest Marinara Combo as it has been dubbed by our team of geneticists—should be extremely proud” he added.According to Plattner the hybrid sandwich began as an attempt to improve the stock of the popular but increasingly inbred Meatball Marinara pedigree by crossbreeding it with a suitable mate. Scientists at the company’s state-of-the-art $200 million breeding laboratory identified the Black Forest Ham as a possible sire due to its heartiness adaptability and hereditary cheese layers.After observing improvements in longevity and succulence over the first several generations of offspring the research team reportedly decided to ramp up the number of mating sessions per week in the hopes of breeding out a latent sogginess trait and increasing the progeny’s natural tolerance to a wider variety of sauces.“The results were promising right from the outset—taste-wise S-74G seemed to take the best attributes of both parents while exhibiting an innate savoriness all its own” said Plattner who oversaw the selection of each procreative pair. “Moreover the hybrid’s physical traits—in particular its juicy yet cohesive mouthfeel—were found to be highly appealing to customers in our Provo UT test market even more so than the subs in its ancestral lineage.”Added Plattner “This is a very promising new specimen that I can see being offered alongside our heritage breeds like the Roast Beef Cold Cut Combo and Italian B.M.T. for a long time to come.”Subway officials went on to note how smoothly the process of crossing the two disparate subgenera had gone given that the varying windows of fertility for each sandwich breed often cause complications for mating. Company scientists also explained the vital role that the various strains’ temperaments play in the interbreeding process citing an incident in 2009 when an entire brood of docile Veggie Delite sandwiches were lost after being left unsupervised around a group of much larger and more aggressive Steak & Cheese subs.In another case illustrating the challenges of sandwich husbandry Plattner described how researchers had spent months trying to coax the notoriously wary and apprehensive Subway Club and a Spicy Italian to breed naturally before finally resorting to artificial insemination.“Unfortunately it’s not uncommon for cross-breeding attempts to show promise at first only to yield a litter of sickly undersized offspring” Plattner said. “But that’s just the nature of our work. Some sandwiches reproduce with no trouble whatsoever while other times you can mate two fertile seemingly compatible subs such as the Turkey Breast and Chicken & Bacon Ranch Melt and then find out that their progeny is utterly inedible. Frankly most of the specimens we produce here are too malformed and grotesque to proceed forward with and have to be euthanized.”“However sometimes even our mistakes turn out to be happy accidents” he continued. “The Sweet Onion Chicken Teriyaki was only created through a mishap in our gene-splicing lab and never in a million years did we think anyone would want to actually eat it.”

Our nation is beset by grave threats both at home and abroad. Our population is fractured and teeming with antagonism. Our economy continues to languish. Now more than ever before this country needs a strong and capable leader.This year as in every election cycle the citizens of the United States have been waiting with great anticipation for the presidential endorsement of our editorial board. This is an awesome and sober responsibility and rest assured it is one whose far-reaching impact we understand full well.Which is why we cannot in good faith offer a presidential endorsement until both Hillary Rodham Clinton and Donald J. Trump mail back completed copies of the 10-part questionnaire we sent them over two months ago.We know that millions of Americans will make their decision based on our recommendation. Thus it would be much too careless—reckless in fact—to offer an endorsement without a rigorous tabulation and analysis of the results of these questionnaires. While lesser publications may be perfectly satisfied to publish their electoral recommendations based on nothing more than individual observation and subjective opinion our editorial board refuses to let the candidates’ public appearances debate performances campaign speeches published statements or advertisements sway our decision in any way.We believe the appropriate manner by which to make such a vital choice for our country is to directly compare the candidates and their beliefs on a series of identical meticulously crafted multiple-choice questions. It is the only sensible option when so much is at stake.The Onion editorial board spent considerable time and effort devising a slate of queries that would with scientific precision expose the candidates’ most heartfelt beliefs and individual characters allowing us to accurately ascertain their competence and fitness to lead. We cannot and will not endorse either nominee until we have such information. Indeed it would be a shameful disservice to this country if we did anything but reserve our judgment.Below you will find The Onion’s 2016 Presidential Preparedness Questionnaire. We ask that if Mr. Trump or Secretary Clinton has happened to misplace the copies of this questionnaire that were sent to their campaign headquarters they print out the following questions on standard 8.5 x 11–inch paper answer each with the utmost care and candor and mail the completed document via overnight express to our offices._____Name (please print):1. What do you consider to be the most important issue facing our nation?2. How can the debt of the U.S. government be eliminated?3. How will you address the problem of homelessness in this country?Please indicate how strongly you agree with the following statements:4. Foreigners living within the borders of the United States and anywhere else in the world must be made to learn and speak English.Strongly disagree / Disagree / Neither agree nor disagree / Agree / Strongly agree5. Popular entertainment in this country has gone too far in the direction of excluding strong male figures and can be blamed for much of the country’s moral decline.Strongly disagree / Disagree / Neither agree nor disagree / Agree / Strongly agree6. The welcoming of Hawaii into the Union was a grave mistake.Strongly disagree / Disagree / Neither agree nor disagree / Agree / Strongly agree7. What can be done about the violence and strife in America’s major cities?8. What is the place of a woman in American society?9. On a scale of 1 to 10 how would you rate your preparedness for the highest office in the land?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1010. Select the attributes that describe you (circle all that apply):Cunning / Stolid / Unmerciful / Retaliatory / Hardened / Strong (physically) / Barbarous / Formidable / Strong (manipulatively) / Punctual / Invulnerable / Unyielding / Clean-shaven / Baronial / AryanSignature:  Date:_____We ask that the candidates pay close attention to each question and give their responses the thought they deserve. We remind them that they must mark their answers with a full and complete circle. IF YOU DO NOT CLOSE YOUR CIRCLES FULLY WE WILL NOT ENDORSE YOU. We cannot stress this enough.We also ask that Governor Johnson not contact us again as we have received five separate completed copies of his questionnaire and do not require any more information from him.The editors of this publication understand that a presidential candidate’s time is precious but Mr. Trump’s and Secretary Clinton’s failure to return our questionnaire by the stated deadline which was written prominently in bold on each mailing is unacceptable. The Onion is providing a great and selfless service to the voting public and it is imperative that both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump act with haste to submit their questionnaires for the good of this nation.We hope that by allowing both candidates an additional seven-day grace period we may still be able to make an endorsement before Election Day. Otherwise Americans will have no choice but to head to the polls directionless and ignorant without the crucial guidance from The Onion they so desperately require.Tu Stultus EsThe Onion Editorial Board

According to reports getting the nation to c’mon has been the foremost initiative of the National Association of Enablers since its founding in 1985. Sources confirmed the group has since expanded its presence to nearly every corner of the country fulfilling its mission to tell residents of all 50 states that they really need to lighten up and just go for it.“What’s the worst that could happen?” Grimm asked the audience dismissing whatever concerns the American people might have with a wave of his hand and suggesting they were worrying over nothing. “What’re you waiting for huh? Let’s go.”At that point sources reported that one of the enablers standing to Grimm’s side who was said to be clad in a tank top that revealed imposing musculature leaned over to the microphone and pleaded with Americans not to be a bunch of wusses especially when what they were talking about wasn’t even that big of a deal. The enabler then insisted there was nothing stopping the nation’s 324 million people from just doing this and he stated furthermore that they’d probably like it anyway. “You gotta” said another of the enablers while loudly chewing gum assuring the public it wouldn’t get hurt or anything. “Stop wasting everyone’s time and just get it over with.”“You scared or something?” he continued. “C’mon.”At press time the American people had reportedly hung their heads in unison looked sheepishly down at their feet and reluctantly given in.

For these reasons we believe the coup could not possibly have taken place without a significant source of outside financing and the operational expertise of the CIA.”“We went to bed last night with the longtime population of Venezuela seemingly comfortable and secure in their positions; when we awoke this morning those residents were gone and in their place were tens of millions of men women and children with strong ties to Washington” she added. “This has the CIA’s fingerprints all over it.”Evidence gathered so far suggests that late last night a small team of top CIA operatives was airdropped via Blackhawk helicopter into the South American nation where they bypassed local security forces and apprehended farmers college students business owners President Nicolás Maduro oil field workers and millions more before escorting the overthrown people of Venezuela out of the country. It is believed every resident of the fifth most populous country on the continent was then replaced with a U.S.-friendly counterpart in a matter of hours.The new Venezuelans who are expected to be far more supportive of U.S. foreign policy were reportedly lying in wait just across the border in Colombia and were quickly installed under cover of darkness. At approximately 6 a.m. members of the replacement population appeared on television to assure the nation that calm had been restored to its streets.Witnesses said the news was met with celebratory rallies across all 23 of Venezuela’s states with droves of recently established citizens parading in public squares where they chanted pro-American slogans and carried homemade signs reading “Renew ties with the U.S.A.!”“There is no evidence to suggest the American intelligence community had any involvement in the events that transpired this morning in Venezuela” CIA director John Brennan told reporters in a morning press conference dismissing such claims as propaganda intended to sow doubt about the legitimacy of the fledgling populace. “By all accounts the coup appears to have been a homegrown movement expressing the will of the Venezuelan people and the United States recognizes the sovereignty of the 30 million new individuals now in place.”Though Brennan disputes the reports evidence of CIA involvement continues to mount with witnesses claiming to have seen federal agents unloading thousands of people from the backs of trucks in Caracas Maracaibo Valencia and over 330 other municipalities. Some even said they had seen the newly instated inhabitants being outfitted with casual everyday clothing and personal accessories before being released across the 350000 square miles of the country.At press time sources confirmed the new Venezuelan populace had already grown displeased at the United States meddling in their affairs and had cut off all communication with Washington.
2016-10-05T11:03:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/man-wakes-from-coma-with-ability-to-understand-health-i-1819579312,Man Wakes From Coma With Ability To Understand Health Insurance Policy,PARKER CO—In what doctors are calling a true medical miracle local construction worker Kal Mathyssen awoke from a week-long coma early Wednesday with the ability to fully comprehend his health insurance plan sources at Parker Adventist Hospital confirmed.Mathyssen who sustained a severe head injury after a fall at a nearby job site reportedly stunned hospital staff and family members when he suddenly regained consciousness around 1 a.m. and began confidently filling out all the paperwork required by managed care company Aetna to receive the benefits guaranteed by his insurance policy.“I was online struggling to figure out what is and isn’t covered by our plan and then Kal just woke up and somehow knew exactly what needed to be done” said Mathyssen’s wife Carol explaining that prior to his coma her husband had possessed only an average person’s understanding of the process required to file for reimbursement of medical expenses. “Kal was on the phone using words I’d never heard come out of his mouth before—stuff about billing codes out-of-pocket maximums and I don’t know what else.”“As soon as he picked up the claim form and knew exactly what to fill in on the line marked ‘employee group number’ I knew something was very different” she continued. “It was just so clear that something had changed inside him.”According to doctors within minutes of waking up in the intensive care unit the 38-year-old began to display an unusually strong grasp of his Aetna Preferred health plan. Astonished onlookers confirmed that after consulting his insurer’s website and listening to a series of recorded messages on a customer service line Mathyssen determined he would be responsible for a $250 emergency room copay the amount remaining on his policy’s aggregate family deductible and the full sticker price of any non-formulary medications he may require during his recovery.In addition several of Mathyssen’s family members said they had a difficult time believing that the man who emerged from the coma was the same person they had always known pointing out that their relative who has seldom made use of his Health Savings Account in the past showed a rare ability to determine which bills he would be able to pay for with his HSA debit card and which nonqualified expenses he would have to pay for with his savings or should that become depleted through a monthly installment plan. “In 21 years of practicing emergency medicine I’ve never seen anything like this” said Dr. Peggy Adams who visited Mathyssen during her morning rounds when the patient reportedly asked about receiving a flu shot and other preventative care procedures his plan covers in full. “It’s impressive that he’s so calm and lucid at this stage but it’s truly astounding that he knew to ask proactively if the hospital was covered as an in-network facility with his HMO.”“He even double-checked with the radiologist to make sure his CT scan would be billed correctly in case the insurance company later disputed the claim” she added. “He certainly came out of that coma with a unique gift.”Bedside sources said they were left shocked and speechless when Mathyssen later picked up his cell phone and not only reached the person he needed to speak with in Aetna’s benefits department but also had a cordial conversation in which he appeared to follow everything the representative was saying ending the call in less than five minutes with a reference number documenting the exchange.“I’ve tried to come up with an explanation for what caused this but I’m at a loss other than to say it’s one of the mysteries of human cognition” said Adams calling Mathyssen’s case “one in a million.” “I suppose one minute you can be on a ventilator fighting for your life and the next you can be entirely aware that your emergency room visit is covered at a different rate than your EMS transfer and that the latter is billed directly by the ambulance company that 911 dispatched to pick you up. It’s truly remarkable.”The physician went on to state that she expects Mathyssen to make a full recovery and that he might one day even gain the ability to understand the paperwork he will need to fill out to file for bankruptcy once he is billed for his hospital stay.
2016-10-04T12:13:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/the-onion-has-obtained-donald-trump-s-tax-returns-and-1819579307,‘The Onion’ Has Obtained Donald Trump’s Tax Returns And Has Chosen To Destroy Them,Our country stands at a pivotal inflection point just five weeks out from a presidential election with wide-reaching implications. With the two leading candidates providing starkly different visions for this country it is incumbent upon the American people to evaluate the nominees’ stances on the issues and appraise their characters with care and precision. The American people must do so fairly and impartially without any undue influence or distraction.Which is why when a cowardly and insidious anonymous source provided The Onion with a complete collection of Donald Trump’s tax returns yesterday morning our editorial board moved promptly to destroy every last page of these financial records.Tax returns are private documents and it is The Onion’s belief that the decision of whether to make them available for public scrutiny should be left solely to the person who filed them. In shredding and then subsequently incinerating the thousands of pages of sensitive and revealing financial information about Mr. Trump The Onion made the only responsible choice. We believe any journalist news organization or advocacy group that would even consider behaving differently in these circumstances—and indeed any reader who even yet wishes to look upon such private information—should be thoroughly appalled at themselves and their crass voyeuristic impulses.Has our democracy fallen so far that even the most confidential records of business write-offs shell companies and overseas financial dealings can now be considered a legitimate subject of public interest?Let us reiterate: Americans have absolutely no right to see these documents or be made aware of their contents and that is why we eradicated these records and disposed of what remained of them at a location we refuse to disclose.We take this situation very seriously. Prior to destroying the returns we consulted with numerous tax professionals who verified the authenticity of the roughly 45000 pages of documents encompassing Donald Trump’s complete state and federal tax returns for every year in which the candidate ever filed as well as corporate returns for every Trump-owned business. In keeping with our commitment to the records’ privacy all of these tax experts were made to sign strict non-disclosure agreements to prevent them from sharing any information gleaned from the documents. Let us assure you that any breach of said agreements will be met with swift and comprehensive legal action and will bring to bear the full tools of journalism at The Onion’s disposal to ensure these experts’ reputations both personal and professional are tarnished beyond the point of any repair.You may have numerous questions about the tax returns: for instance whether these documents contained information about Mr. Trump’s income his businesses’ profits or losses or any tax maneuvers he may have exercised throughout his lifetime. The answer on all accounts is yes. You may ask whether the filings revealed Mr. Trump’s net worth as it progressed over the course of decades. Again the answer is yes. You may ask whether the documents revealed how much or how little he paid to the Internal Revenue Service in any or all of the 52 years for which we obtained records. The answer is yes once more. You may ask whether you may see this information for yourself. There the answer is a decisive and impassioned no.Has our democracy fallen so far that even the most confidential records of business write-offs shell companies and overseas financial dealings can now be considered a legitimate subject of public interest? Lesser media outlets may think so but The Onion will continue to stand by our belief that the sensitive financial disclosures of the wealthy and powerful should be protected from the unauthorized scrutiny of the nation’s voters.In addition to the complete and irrevocable destruction of these documents The Onion has committed itself to taking the following steps to ensure the continued confidentiality of Mr. Trump’s returns:We believe these steps are necessary to protect the privacy of our nation’s affluent and privileged few and to discourage less principled “journalists” from infringing on that privacy by sharing unlawfully obtained financial documents. Rest assured we at The Onion will see that any attempt to violate this norm does not go unpunished.America must vote next month on the candidates and what they stand for not on their personal and business dealings which as long as The Onion has any say in the matter will always remain private.
2016-09-22T11:09:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/report-u-s-students-lack-language-skills-vocabulary-1819579257,Report: U.S. Students Lack Language Skills, Vocabulary To Effectively Belittle Classmates,WASHINGTON—According to an alarming new report published Thursday by the National Center for Education Research the majority of American students do not possess the language skills and vocabulary necessary to belittle their classmates in an effective manner.The report based on observations of more than 500000 students around the country from kindergarten through 12th grade concludes that while most can easily perceive weakness and vulnerability in their fellow schoolchildren their rudimentary linguistic capabilities routinely prevent them from mocking the appearance personality or athletic ability of others in such a way that those individuals are reduced to tears and suffer chronically low self-esteem.“Unfortunately most of our students are finishing high school with only a fifth-grade ability to shame and deride their peers” said report co-author and educational psychologist Joyce Marrone observing that most graduates cannot string together two sentences about a classmate’s lisp or general weirdness with enough proficiency to completely devastate them. “While they know how to identify a loser they lack the semantic tools to articulate exactly why that person is so lame ugly or stupid.”“For example millions of students can make the basic observation that a classmate is a gaywad” she continued “but very few are able to take the next step of making a logical persuasive argument as to why their fellow student licks so many dicks.”Researchers reportedly visited schools in more than a dozen states to record student interactions between classes and at recess discovering that attempts to tear into a less popular peer were often marred by a limited rhetorical aptitude. In one case students were reportedly able to form short declarative sentences indicating that a classmate smelled bad but they could not create a broader critique suggesting that the odor probably resulted from the classmate wearing the same Sears clothes every day and that this was in turn likely the result of his mom being poor on welfare and perhaps even a prostitute.According to the report such logical reasoning skills are essential if students are to have any hope of making their classmates dread returning to school every day or of motivating other children to gang up on the despised persons to ensure they never feel comfortable simply being themselves.“The sad reality is that our students just haven’t developed a rich enough understanding of language to express the contempt they feel toward someone who’s nerdy a spaz or completely gross” said Marrone adding that the average eighth-grader knows only two synonyms for “slut.” “American educators should be gravely concerned that most middle schoolers don’t even grasp simile and metaphor firmly enough to ridicule a person’s weight by likening him or her to a cow a whale or a pile of excrement.” “And even fewer understand the principles of alliteration enough to call such a person a fat-faced fuck” she added.By early elementary school the report recommends children should start forming the analytical capacity to take cheap shots at the denseness or dumb-looking face of anyone who is different than they are. The researchers warned development delays in this area all but ensure students will reach adolescence without the rudimentary rhyming skills required for example to bully a boy named Aiden by calling him Gayden or the facility with wordplay needed to humiliate a girl named Sarah Wilcox by calling her Sarah Will-suck-cocks.The report urges educators to help students master the fundamental verbal slights that will allow them to subtly question a female’s competence or snidely remark on a male’s perceived lack of masculinity noting the relevance of such skills outside the classroom. Said Marrone “If they don’t achieve linguistic proficiency while in school they’ll never develop the gossiping bad-mouthing or shit-talking skills they’ll need to succeed in the workforce.”

Similarly the results indicated a state of anguish will be permanent for 99.6 percent of those suffering from a sense that their life is headed in the wrong direction and there is nothing they can do to stop it.The study which began with clinical trials and field observations in 1986 also concluded that anyone who at any point became anxious or melancholy never again experienced happiness in any form regardless of any changes in their exercise habits diet psychological or pharmacological treatments relationship status or employment situation.In addition the report’s authors recommended that if you feel bad at present you should simply save yourself further trouble by abandoning any hope of things ever getting better.Greg Hudson a participant in the study who said he hasn’t felt a pleasant or even neutral emotion since the 1990s told reporters he agreed with the researchers’ recommendation.“About 20 years ago I was going through a hard time both at work and at home putting in too many hours and having difficulty getting along with my boss while at the same time dealing with some marital stress” said Hudson a visibly weary man now in his 50s. “Just waking up and getting out of bed every day was like torture. That was in 1997 and I can honestly say that today after all these years I feel every bit as awful as I did back then. At no point has anything changed. Ever.”The study also found strong evidence to suggest that feelings of pure joy can be expected to dissipate completely within one to two seconds after they first appear.
2016-09-02T09:10:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/new-stem-initiative-just-tries-to-dissuade-students-in-1819579219,New STEM Initiative Just Tries To Dissuade Students In Other Countries From Pursuing Science Careers,WASHINGTON—In an effort to improve America’s ranking in the global technology sector the U.S. Department of Education unveiled a new STEM initiative Friday designed to discourage students in other countries from choosing careers in science and math.Officials described the 10-year $80 million strategic plan as the government’s most substantive STEM policy to date saying it would include ad campaigns after-school programs and financial incentives aimed at dampening enthusiasm for all scientific and technological pursuits among students in more than 50 foreign nations.“U.S students have lagged behind in STEM fields for far too long so now we’re taking steps to persuade kids in other countries that a degree in physics or biology or robotics just isn’t worth it” said Education Secretary John King Jr. conceding the new measure is the only way our nation’s children can possibly keep pace with the rest of the world. “From preschool up to the university level we hope to bring non-Americans around to the idea that science is boring and assure them that a career in communications or social services will be more emotionally fulfilling than a job as a geneticist or software engineer.”“No child outside the United States should complete their education without a strong indifference toward the STEM disciplines” King added. “That’s our goal here.”A U.S.–funded multimillion-dollar ad campaign titled “Less Science More Fun” which is set to debut in Singapore this week is said to highlight the stark contrast between STEM careers and other professions with side-by-side footage of a haggard-looking mathematician toiling away in a windowless office and a group of young attractive paralegals laughing together over happy-hour drinks. Another of the campaign’s ads will reportedly feature physically robust street cleaners extolling the benefits of working outside and using their hands. Moreover the initiative’s chief strategists relayed plans for a “highly addictive” new gaming app to be made available in foreign countries that will require absolutely no logic or reasoning skills instead awarding points based on a player’s ability to perform simple repetitive tasks in a virtual factory that assembles vacuum cleaners.In Scandinavia where a well-funded preschool system ensures children are adequately prepared for the rigors of academia the focus is expected to be on early intervention with U.S. programs reaching out to toddlers directly in an effort to sour them on STEM subjects before they even enter the education system.“We’re already seeing positive effects from a children’s TV series we recently launched in Finland called Iggo which follows the adventures of Iggo the foxhound as he explores the many wonderful facets of the service sector” said Lillian Winslow a senior advisor at the Education Department. “Kids really love it when Iggo plays tricks on his surly next-door neighbor a loveless and chronically dissatisfied biochemist named Dulf.”“It’s really encouraging to see kids as young as 3 with that look in their eyes that tells you they have no interest in the sciences whatsoever” she continued. “We’re already planting that seed.”According to U.S. officials the initiative will also award up to $10 million in scholarships each year to European and East Asian students willing to change their majors from engineering to the humanities. In addition grants will reportedly be available to young women abroad who agree to drop out of computer science programs and become homemakers.Sources confirmed that on-campus college recruitment efforts which include job fairs and a lecture series featuring speakers who quit school entirely to pursue artistic passions ranging from dance to homemade jewelry-making are already being rolled out in Switzerland South Korea Canada and numerous other high-achieving STEM regions around the world.“I picked up a pamphlet at a career fair the other day and it had all these really interesting facts about how important it is to coordinate a business staff’s benefits package and ensure a company’s compensation structure complies with applicable local and national laws” said Anson Hui a 23-year-old grad student who used to study thermodynamics at the University of Hong Kong. “It sounds incredible. I can’t wait to pursue a future in human resources!”
2016-08-30T08:58:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/team-of-vatican-geneticists-successfully-clone-god-1819579224,Team Of Vatican Geneticists Successfully Clone God,VATICAN CITY—Describing the groundbreaking work as a major step forward for theological research a team of Vatican geneticists held a press conference Tuesday at the Apostolic Palace to announce they had successfully cloned God.The team of ordained scientists from the Catholic Church’s Order of Holy Genomics confirmed they had after decades of concerted effort and numerous failed attempts finally succeeded in creating a genetically identical copy of the Almighty. The newborn God clone #8RR19 which the team has nicknamed “Marvin” has reportedly survived for over seven weeks since emerging from an incubation vat in the basement laboratory of St. Peter’s Basilica.“By artificially producing a fully functional God who possesses all of the divine traits of the original we now have the ability to conduct hands-on research on the Lord” said Father Giancarlo Bertinotti who first conceived of fertilizing a Supreme Being embryo by extracting sublime DNA from a skin cell of the Hand of God and injecting the holy genetic material into a donor egg cell. “It may now be possible to answer some of our greatest questions about our Creator such as whether there are any observable boundaries of His love if He is incapable of forgiving certain sins and how exactly He comes to dwell inside all of us.”“This breakthrough marks a new chapter in our quest to quantify precisely how great and good God is” Bertinotti continued.According to team leaders the experimental project to recreate God first achieved success in 1995 when researchers cloned a cherub the least complex of all Heavenly forms. During the winter of 2004 the team is said to have finally succeeded in growing a cluster of divinely radiant cells in a petri dish a research milestone that helped secure the additional Vatican funding required to proceed to the final stage of bringing a cloned God to life.The newborn Marvin who has reportedly only grown to one one-hundredth the size of a fully adult God is the 31st fertilized embryo created by the lab but just the first clone to survive past the first week of infancy. Recalling the long and frustrating period of trial and error involved in the cloning process the scientists noted that the initial Gods that were created suffered from a variety of health and developmental problems such as an inability to see all things difficulty passing divine judgment full-body hairlessness and fallibility.The scientists reported they were especially pleased to see Marvin had developed infinite benevolence unlike His predecessor from 2009 Tom III whose excessive wrath threatened to destroy the entire universe until the geneticists resorted to euthanization.“Based on our medical evaluations we believe Marvin can expect to enjoy a healthy holy life for all of eternity” said Bertinotti who added that the exact genetic copy of God was currently being monitored in a secured habitat enclosure designed to replicate the natural blissful conditions of His Divine Kingdom. “Early performance tests suggest that He possesses complete omniscience and even at this early age we have observed Him beginning to transcend space and time something none of our previous specimens came close to achieving.”“Furthermore repeated testing suggests that His ability to create something where there was once nothing matches the performance benchmarks of our original God of Heaven” Bertinotti continued.Despite numerous clinical trials scientists conceded that Marvin has yet to successfully impregnate a virgin woman leaving open the possibility that the clone specimen is sterile.“Now that we have successfully cloned God the possibilities are truly endless” said Bertinotti suggesting the Church may choose to grow a supply of usable divine internal organs as potential replacements should God’s ever begin to fail. “Our new technique also provides us with the power to recreate God should the naturally occurring population of our Heavenly Father ever go extinct.”“I can also say that going forward we hope to explore whether gene therapy could inhibit God’s intense feelings of jealousy and finally control his urges to smite” Bertinotti continued.

Divided into groups of three they reportedly make incisions into the trunk of their assigned sandwich and closely examine the layers of meat and cheese inside as well as the fluids present in the specimen. While handling the cadavers officials said the trainees must don protective gloves and surgical masks so as to limit their direct exposure to the food. Despite these precautions however many trainees have reported that when they leave the lab in the evening their scrubs are often covered in Savory Caesar honey mustard or Chipotle Southwest sauce.“Nothing really prepares you for your first time seeing a gray lifeless Spicy Italian lying there on a stainless steel operating tray” said trainee Monica Alton recalling how she became nauseous on her first day when she cut into the pasty foot-long and watched its condiments ooze out. “I took one look at the thick vein of mayonnaise running along its ventral side and I thought I was going to vomit. It’s easier for me now but to be honest you never really get used to the smell.”According to Subway officials the cadaver session is the most difficult element of employee training with as many as 20 percent of each class washing out when confronted with the graphic sights and the often uncomfortable exercise of feeling around inside a sandwich. Instructors stated that it is not uncommon for new trainees to become lightheaded or even pass out the first time they are asked to slice into a meatball to view what’s inside.In addition sources said many trainees do not pass the practical exam that follows the section during which they must drain off all sandwich dressings before removing and correctly labeling each topping. “The first time I opened up a Sweet Onion Chicken Teriyaki I had no idea what the hell I was looking at” said Dylan Corbell a trainee who remarked that the inner contents of Subway menu items were like nothing he had ever imagined. “It’s hard to know what’s cucumber and what’s banana pepper in there—it all kind of looks the same. And I just never realized how stiff and pale the tomatoes would be. I have to admit I still shudder when I think about reaching in there and feeling the clammy lettuce shreds.”“But of course this is the kind of stuff you just have to get used to if you’re going to work at Subway” he added.According to officials once trainees have completed their dissection of a cadaver the remains of each sandwich are cremated to ensure their safe and sanitary disposal.

They just can’t.”“There’s no way” the entire U.S. population added silently to themselves.Reports confirmed the thought was identical across all demographics with every American regardless of income age occupation political affiliation religion or health coming to the realization that this just keeps going on and on and on and there isn’t any reason to think it will end anytime soon.The stark notion is said to have occupied the mind of a bank teller in downtown Cincinnati late this morning as well as the customer whose balance he was checking the three people standing behind the customer in line the dentist filling a cavity three floors up the patient having her cavity filled a handful of people waiting for the bus outside the building dozens of pedestrians at the adjacent crosswalk each of the drivers who passed by them everyone else in the greater Cincinnati area and indeed everyone in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. “Why am I even trying anymore?” thought Minneapolis cashier Sarah Collins 23 while ringing up the purchase of Walter Nathanson a 68-year-old retiree who arrived at the exact same conclusion while taking his change folding it neatly in his wallet and telling the young woman to have a nice day. “What’s the fucking point?”As the nation’s residents wondered how they could possibly carry on with even one more second of this sources confirmed they continued to chop vegetables ride in elevators participate in conference calls lie in bed next to their spouse take crosstown buses reheat leftovers walk upstairs put gas in their cars put their shoes on shave stare blankly at a computer or phone screen walk back downstairs make photocopies or pour themselves a drink of water.While reactions to the thought were imperceptible to most casual onlookers an audible exhalation reportedly left the lips of all 320 million of the country’s inhabitants at the exact same time. In addition the eyes of the entire population are believed to have been cast downward for a brief simultaneous moment as they each individually concluded that they simply didn’t have it in them to keep this up.“Jesus…” thought every American upon evaluating the circumstances that had brought them to this point. “I just can’t deal with this. Not anymore.”At press time reports indicated every single person in the country had gritted their teeth and forced their mouth into a resigned smile before moving on with their day.

He also added that he was pleased to see so many familiar faces in the audience but that he was especially happy to see all the new faces in attendance there this year.“Issa [Saharkhiz] I know you’re a picky eater so I made sure you got your favorite meal” said Khamenei gesturing toward the empty plate in front of the political journalist who has withstood three hunger strikes since his arrest in November. “Just don’t overdo it okay? Last time you did that we had to send you to the hospital.”“Now I know some of you have been critical of the conditions here at Evin but I promise I’ve only got a couple more jokes left” Khamenei added.The supreme leader remarked that he was grateful for such a packed house pointing out that every seat in the prison dining hall was filled with journalists activists and their family members. Sources confirmed the evening’s schedule included not only dinner and Khamenei’s address but also a group of Evin prison guards performing a highly choreographed routine of lashings and mock executions.“These days with so many people saying the newspaper industry is dead I almost regret having gotten so involved in it myself” Khamenei said. “Personally I feel terrible about the decline of print media but don’t quote me on that—really it’s in you and your loved ones’ best interest not to quote me on that.”Khamenei went on to deliver a series of snappy one-liners about Narges Mohammadi a journalist and women’s rights advocate recently given a 16-year sentence quipping that the interrogators at the prison had probably learned their tactics by watching the way she conducts her interviews.Nearing the end of his monologue the 77-year-old cleric acknowledged all the journalists in exile who were unable to attend the dinner saying he hoped to see them at the event next year.“In all seriousness though” said Khamenei concluding the evening’s remarks on a note of heartfelt sincerity “you guys represent the voice of the people and that’s why I’m so glad you’re here tonight.”
2016-08-03T14:54:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/obama-holds-camp-david-summit-to-ease-tensions-with-coy-1819579099,Obama Holds Camp David Summit To Ease Tensions With Coyotes,THURMONT MD—Predicting a landmark diplomatic breakthrough in the historically bitter and contentious relationship President Barack Obama said Wednesday he has high hopes for talks this week at Camp David intended to ease tensions with the coyote population.The three-day summit attended by top U.S. officials and leading members of the coyote community is the first in a series of peace negotiations aimed at resolving decades of bloody strife between the wild canine species and the American people. Aides said the two parties would seek to address a lengthy list of grievances including outrage among the coyote delegation over thousands of deaths in recent years at the hands of American hunters and speeding cars as well as mounting anger from the Obama administration regarding coyotes’ persistent attacks on U.S. livestock and a continuing string of antagonistic trash can topplings.“Though we come from vastly different cultures social backgrounds and taxonomic ranks coyotes and Americans are united by a shared desire to coexist peacefully on the hiking trails and campsites of this great land” Obama told reporters in a morning press conference at the presidential retreat as he stood alongside the U.S. delegation and a pack of coyote dignitaries. “After years of strained relations and small incidents that have boiled over into larger ones the time has come to address the violence and killing on both sides.”“Together we can resolve our land disputes and put a stop to the unnecessary bloodshed” he continued. “Our hope is that one day coyotes and Americans will no longer regard one another with fear and instead live together in harmony.”The current meeting marks the first peaceful gathering of its kind since the mid-1990s. For decades the two groups have been locked in what experts describe as a vicious cycle of brutality and retribution with members of the coyote population repeatedly crossing into agricultural zones where they inflict mass casualties and cause extensive property damage which in turn provokes enraged Americans to send in federal Wildlife Services agents to gun down and poison approximately 80000 coyotes per year a response many in the diplomatic community have criticized as disproportionate.According to sources Obama and the visiting envoy of coyotes hope to make significant progress on several core issues especially border disputes in contested areas between U.S. suburbs and key wooded regions. However deep-seated American resentment over the coyotes’ refusal to stop tunneling underneath their backyard fences is expected to make any compromise difficult as is the unwillingness of coyotes to budge on the right to prowl through city parks late at night and howl for hours on end.Sources confirmed that talks between the parties nearly broke down earlier today following a heated incident in the Laurel Lodge conference room when a member of the coyote party sprang toward the throat of a White House staffer carrying a tray of refreshments into the meeting.“This is a watershed moment for both sides and it is imperative that this summit succeeds if we wish to avoid another Buena Park” said Adrian Lockhart a leading scholar of the U.S.–coyote conflict referencing the Southern California city where a local family’s pet dachshund was brutally attacked by a coyote in 1987 which many historians regard as a breaking point in relations that precipitated the ongoing internecine clash. “But frankly the negotiators will have a difficult time reaching terms that are acceptable to hardline American sheep and goat ranchers who have difficulty seeing the species as anything but cold-blooded killers given that many of them have looked on helplessly as their animals were ruthlessly murdered before their very eyes.”“Of course just as hard to appease will be those coyote families who going back to the 19th century have had loved ones trapped and skinned by American fur hunters” he continued. “Within the coyote population where day-to-day survival is so much more difficult than it is among the U.S. population a deep and abiding wariness of Americans is simply a way of life. That’s going to be hard to overcome.” Sources have noted that progress albeit minor has been made since the talks began. During a closed-door session today Obama reportedly offered to temporarily halt the building of settlements in lands traditionally held by the coyotes extracting in exchange a promise that the animals keep at least five feet away from all urban compost piles.Moreover sources say that both sides remain optimistic about renewing a major National Park–sharing agreement that was initially brokered by representatives from the U.N. E.U. and red fox communities during a summit in 2002.“Although we still have a long way to go the two sides gathered here have taken an important step toward securing our common future” the president said later as he stepped into Camp David’s Hickory Lodge to partake in a traditional coyote meal of raw rabbit and garbage. “Neither side wants to perpetuate this cycle of violence by passing this anger and disdain onto our children and pups. We believe they deserve better.”

Sometimes we eat the food during TV too. Or sometimes after TV.”“Then we go to sleep and in the morning we wake up and then we get the food again” residents continued.Without being asked citizens of the Windy City then reportedly listed several dozen of their favorite things to eat including Chicago deep-dish pizza Chicago-style hot dogs pierogies fried chicken macaroni and cheese and pork chops. During the litany of foods “spaghetti and meatballs” was said to have been mentioned at least twice evidently without residents noticing that they had repeated themselves.“And hamburgers” Chicago’s population said brows unfurrowing following a moment of intense consideration.The city’s populace then appeared to become distracted reportedly slipping into a deep reverie that was evidently due to the food items they had just mentioned with many mumbling “beef” and “cheese” under their breath and staring several yards in front of them apparently at nothing.“Hey” Chicago residents said tugging at reporters’ sleeves as they attempted to walk away having assumed the interaction was over. “The food is good—when we eat the food and then all the food is gone we don’t like that.”“But then more food comes” they added. “And when we get more food we eat all of it. All the food.”According to reports the city of Chicago then said “Okay bye” before ducking into a nearby Italian beef sandwich shop.

At that point they become almost impossible to locate.”“That’s why it is so important that we devote all the necessary resources to recovering a lost child before they ride on the back of a giant bird to a secret island” Phillippe added. “After that it’s simply too late.”Phillippe said the first few hours can be especially critical in uncovering clues that could pinpoint a missing child’s whereabouts such as the footprints of a tiny gnome the child followed as it scampered into the woods a ribbon that fell from their hair as they ventured down into a glowing well or small patches of snow remaining in their bedroom after a blustery passageway to a wintery kingdom opened beneath their bed. The investigator added that it was vitally important that members of search parties remain alert at all times as they scoured the homes or grounds where children went missing listening closely for the faint sound of the children’s disembodied voices echoing softer and softer as they descended deeper into a fantastical world.Additionally officials emphasized the importance of quickly identifying key witnesses who may have knowledge of which enchanted realm the children might have vanished into such as the mysterious old man at the town clock shop who sold them a golden pocket watch or any neighbors who may have heard the children’s cries as they were carried out a window and into the sky by a dragon made of paper.Phillippe conceded however that if a child has disappeared into a world that can be seen only by children the odds of safely retrieving them fall to almost zero.“Ideally within the first hour or two after a child has gone missing there should be a qualified team of investigators onsite to perform a thorough sweep of the premises to search for any mirrors that appear to be made of silvery liquid small doorways hidden among tangles of tree roots or storybooks open to a page the child might have leapt into” Phillippe said. “The tragic fact however is that if these portals aren’t found quickly enough these children may already be toiling under the rule of an evil queen who at first seemed kind or sailing across the ocean using a large walnut shell as a boat.”“And that’s not even factoring in the challenge of positively identifying a child within a particular world where people age 30 times faster than normal” he continued.In addition to emphasizing the need for quick action officials urged the public to take proper precautions to reduce the risk that children would go missing into another realm in the first place such as disallowing them from playing hide-and-seek in a dusty old mansion or keeping an eye on them during family walks through the woods to ensure they don’t lag behind by themselves to look at a strange symbol carved into a rock.Moreover authorities warned that children were at far greater risk of stumbling into a portal to another world if they were left in the care of an unkind governess or sent to live with their grandmother in the country.“When Elizabeth and William went out to play in the garden one day last summer I thought it would only be a matter of time before they came home hungry for supper” said Tabitha Newsom whose children went missing after crawling through a hollow log into a world where everything is made of gemstones. “But once I’d contacted the authorities they had already been enlisted to lead the Army Of The Seven Pendants and were embroiled in a tense battle with the Ruby Kingdom. They were gone.”“I never should have allowed them to follow that giant glimmering butterfly” she added.Authorities noted that after 48 hours only a handful of children are ever recovered and those who are often take years to work through the trauma of being held captive in the dungeon of Upside-Down Castle or watching their sister get turned into a statue.

We really bring out the best in one another.”Citing the New Horizons probe’s Pluto flyby and the Curiosity rover’s landing on Mars as examples Greer told reporters it was hard not to take immense pride in the landmark achievements he and his colleagues have made since he was first hired to run NASA’s social media presence. Greer who majored in communications at DePaul University and joined NASA after a summer marketing internship with the e-commerce site Groupon added that behind the agency’s awe-inspiring feats are countless long days and sleepless nights that most Americans never see.The employee tasked with curating the agency’s LinkedIn page was also quick to point out that at NASA he and his fellow staff members are always expected to place the mission ahead of their own personal egos. Greer stressed that whether they are gathering data from space telescopes devising next-generation technologies to enable extraplanetary habitation or repromoting posts from the agency’s Tumblr account neither he nor his coworkers are concerned with claiming individual credit for their contributions.Furthermore Greer said he and the agency’s engineers physicists and crewmembers were essentially one large family.“Preparing for the last [International Space] Station resupply required all hands on deck” Greer said of the recent mission which he documented and shared on Twitter and Instagram using the hashtag #NASASocial. “The technicians were working around the clock to monitor the rocket the meteorologists were closely assessing atmospheric conditions and the whole time I was juggling tweets covering the launch with that week’s Periscope tour of the Kennedy Space Center.”“It was so exhausting but at the same time it was extremely exciting to have been part of it” he continued. “Especially the moment when I could just step back and watch the posts go live.”While stating that he thoroughly enjoys his work Greer admitted to reporters that with so much at stake in their day-to-day operations he like everyone at NASA tends to place an enormous amount of pressure on himself to avoid letting down his colleagues. The man responsible for posting clips of NASA press conferences to YouTube went on to say that when he is feeling burnt out from the demands of the job he needs only to remind himself of the millions of young Americans who NASA is inspiring every single day.“What I like most about working here is that although this job is incredibly demanding I get to show up each day knowing we’re really doing something meaningful” said the man who has the ability to queue up several hours’ worth of social media posts ahead of time allowing him to sometimes leave work as early as 2 p.m. “It’s enough of a reward just to be surrounded by the type of people who are always challenging and pushing one another to reach greater heights. We really bring out the best in one another.”Added Greer: “This job isn’t for everyone. It’s a high-stress environment but man it’s such a payoff when we take a look at everything we’ve accomplished.”

And perhaps most frighteningly our models suggest that we may have discovered them too late to contain further spread.”“We urge citizens to take common-sense precautions by avoiding these public pools as well as any dripping wet or towel-clad individuals who may have recently been exposed to one” he continued. “While it’s important that citizens not panic we want to make it clear to the public just how disgusting these things are.”Researchers confirmed that the pools which they said are most easily identified by their grimy concrete surfaces and prominent ring of damp plastic chairs surrounding them are typically found in local and state parks but noted that some private clubs have also been known to harbor the lukewarm blue-colored basins teeming with assorted detritus. Officials also warned that while the risk of exposure appears greatest in the warmer months the prevalence of public pools inside schools and hotels means that Americans are in danger of contact throughout the year.Frieden reported that the CDC is currently formulating a plan to eradicate the pools by draining them as quickly as possible. In the interim he cautioned that Americans—especially young children and those with weakened immune systems—should maintain a minimum distance of 150 feet from any public pool they may encounter adding that even minimal exposure of five minutes or less was likely to pose serious risks ranging from the possibility of encountering pockets of urine to the high likelihood of wading into clusters of dead bugs and other unidentified floating matter that clump together in pools’ corners.Those who believe they may have come into contact with a public pool were advised by officials to immediately call a hotline listed on the CDC’s website.“The reality is that anyone anywhere could end up in a public pool” said Frieden who noted that the organization was developing a special task force to address the related scourges of communal hot tubs and water parks it had also recently uncovered. “The last thing we want is for Americans to take this situation lightly. These pools are nasty smelly and almost certainly contain trace amounts of fecal matter.”“Frankly it’s hard to believe something as awful as this could still exist in the 21st century ” he added.
2016-06-10T10:51:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/fbi-discontinues-surveillance-of-muslim-americans-after-1819578948,FBI Discontinues Surveillance Of Muslim Americans After Completing 15-Year Study Of Beautiful Culture,WASHINGTON—After 15 years of broadly targeting the 3.3-million-member community and extensively monitoring its activities the FBI declared an end Friday to its surveillance of Muslim Americans saying its exhaustive study of their beautiful culture was finally complete.Officials confirmed that the program was started in the fall of 2001 when federal agents captivated by Islam’s complex history and rich spiritual traditions redirected the full force of the bureau’s intelligence-gathering apparatus toward developing a more thoughtful nuanced appreciation of the Muslim-American way of life.“We’d always known Islam was one of the great world religions but it wasn’t until we recruited a network of 15000 informants and infiltrated mosques all over the country that we came to understand just how magnificent and fascinating it truly is” said FBI director James B. Comey who noted that agents gained a valuable and eye-opening understanding of Islam—while also learning a lot about themselves and their own faith in the process—after entering the Muslim places of worship to collect as much information as they could on the intriguing personal beliefs of the religion’s followers. “After analyzing the transcripts of thousands of phone calls and intercepting the communications of prominent Muslim-American leaders and academics we’ve really come to admire their vibrant culture.”“The considerable amount of intel we’ve gathered and carefully pored over for the past 15 years has shown us that their faith and customs are really quite inspiring” Comey added. “If there’s one thing we’ve taken away from all our surveillance it’s what a glorious and enriching part of our world Islam is.”According to sources within the bureau the harvesting of internet data widespread racial profiling and the nationwide mapping of Muslim communities have allowed agents to closely observe the followers of Islam on an extremely personal level thereby allowing them to develop a deep respect for the amazing ethnic and cultural diversity of the faith’s 1.6 billion believers as well as the striking distinctions between the religion’s various sects which they stressed went far beyond just Sunni and Shiite.Remarking on all the information they had gathered FBI officials emphasized that adherents of Islam speak dozens of beautiful languages—Arabic but also Urdu Pashto Farsi Bengali Javanese and many others—and noted that agents came to treasure this linguistic richness after installing recording devices throughout Muslim-American communities and then surreptitiously listening in on Quranic study groups prayer sessions and social events.“Thanks to advances in video surveillance we’ve been able to look inside Muslims’ homes and view some breathtaking calligraphy prints and handwoven tapestries” said former agent Casey Hanna who fondly recalled assignments that allowed him to overhear moving recitations of the Hadith which he was fascinated to learn come from an oral tradition and are considered to be the direct word of the Prophet Muhammad. “I went undercover in hundreds of Muslim-owned businesses and residences across the nation and was lucky enough to sample many variations on the aromatic stews and delectable desserts that serve as staples of halal cuisine—Arabian North African Indonesian. They were all delicious and unlike anything I’d ever tasted.”“I’ll never forget this one instance when I closely trailed a New York shop owner for three straight years—his coffee was just spectacular” Hanna added. “Muslims were the first people to drink coffee you know.”After realizing they could not fully nurture their curiosity by limiting their study to Muslims in the United States the FBI reportedly enlisted the help of the NSA to find out more about the incredible religion. Between 2002 and 2008 the bureau is known to have monitored 7485 email addresses around the globe in order to learn answers to their many questions about Muslims’ compelling lives and rituals from why they don’t eat pork to what Muslim holidays are like to why some Muslim women wear garments that cover their heads while others don’t.Comey told reporters the FBI also received information from the CIA whose enhanced interrogation techniques and clandestine intelligence-gathering methods yielded many interesting revelations from Muslim sources around the world such as the fact that Arabs make up only 15 percent of the global Muslim population and that through most of history women in Islamic societies actually had more property rights than women in the West.Saying they thoroughly enjoyed studying “such a lovely people and such a lovely faith” Comey explained that agents would often remove a Muslim citizen from their community and keep them detained for days weeks or even months on end to learn everything they could from them about Islam.“There’s no way I could remember the names of all the Muslim citizens that our agents brought in to discuss the beauty of Islam with one-on-one but rest assured that with their help the FBI has gained a deep and illuminating understanding of Islamic culture” said Comey who noted that by combing through thousands upon thousands of citizens’ banking records agents discovered with astonishment how some observant Muslims set up special loan payment plans to avoid paying interest as they consider it usury which is forbidden under Sharia law. “It’s crazy to think about but until little more than a decade ago I had no idea there were Five Pillars of Islam that guided all Muslims’ spiritual lives. I also didn’t know anything about the multitude of Muslim contributions to mathematics and science that have been absolutely vital to the world. But that’s not to say they don’t value art though. Poets like Rumi and Hafez drew upon mystical Sufist interpretations of the Quran to write verse that is every bit as sublime as say Keats or Coleridge. And don’t even get me started on the architecture.”“As this program sadly comes to an end I just want to thank Muslim Americans from the bottom of my heart for teaching us all about your faith and your culture” he continued. “We’ve learned so much about you over the years. More than you could possibly imagine.”
2016-06-08T09:09:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/obama-discovers-telepathic-connection-with-military-dro-1819578944,Obama Discovers Telepathic Connection With Military Drone In Afghanistan,‘Our Minds Have Become One’ Shaken President SaysWASHINGTON—Appearing frightened and confused by his unexplained new powers President Barack Obama reportedly pulled members of the White House staff aside Wednesday to inform them of his recently discovered telepathic connection with an Afghanistan-based military drone.The president who said he began receiving the unusually vivid visions in April explained that the grainy black-and-white bombing runs against senior leaders of the Taliban and al-Qaeda that he now experiences on a near-daily basis appeared to be images from the live video feed of CIA Predator Drone #AA32. According to the visibly shaken commander-in-chief he can neither control nor anticipate when the chilling scenes will appear.“It just comes over me and there’s nothing I can do about it—without warning I’ll feel dizzy and lightheaded and then all of a sudden I’m circling high above a mountain range” said Obama adding that the powerful dreamlike images include distant cars and buildings exploding along with the unmistakable chatter of CIA controllers on the ground. “Then later when I’m being debriefed on our latest drone strike I’ll recognize the footage as the exact same scene from my visions. At first it only happened at night when I was asleep and I’d wake up drenched in sweat. But after a while it started happening when I was awake too at any hour of the day. I wish I could make them stop but I can’t.”“It seems that whatever the drone sees I see” he added trembling. “Our minds have melded into one.”The president confirmed roughly three dozen telepathic episodes visions he described as often depicting rural villages overlaid with digital readouts of the unmanned aerial vehicle’s speed altitude and navigation vectors as well as the targeting system’s crosshairs. Obama said that the images which are always preceded by a sudden flash of blue light initially lasted only seconds at a time but had recently begun to include entire hours-long reconnaissance missions along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.Several White House aides claiming to have witnessed the president receiving one of his Predator visions confirmed that Obama typically grows pale and stares off into the distance as he begins to see through the lens of the UAV. Staff members also noted that the president’s body typically stiffens and he becomes completely unresponsive his eyes reportedly rolling back into his head and remaining there until the mysterious connection ends.Additionally one anonymous White House source described a recent startling incident during which the president who was working in the Oval Office late at night suddenly began rocking back and forth and reciting a stream of GPS coordinates in a flat monotone before eventually collapsing forward onto the Resolute desk.“The first time I saw the president have a vision was during a lunch meeting to follow up on the progress of the Iran nuclear accord” said Secretary of State John Kerry adding that as the two discussed the findings of U.N. inspections the president abruptly stopped speaking mid-sentence dropped his fork to the floor and closed his eyes as he entered a deep trance. “The president was just sitting there completely silent until he snapped out of it several minutes later and whispered that we had just taken out a top-level Taliban commander and six of his subordinates and inflicted limited collateral damage on a nearby school.”“When [National Security Advisor] Susan Rice interrupted the meeting several moments later to inform him of the strike he cut her off and said ‘I know’” Kerry continued.Obama reported that over time he has begun to experience physical sensations he believes may be related to the connections he experiences including pounding headaches and immense fatigue on the days when the drone has participated in multiple missions. The president also recalled a specific episode last week in which he suffered a painful burning sensation in his fingertips only to learn later that the drone had taken on anti-aircraft fire that same afternoon.“Wait I’m getting one now; it’s acquiring the target outside Jalalabad” said Obama before descending into a low unfluctuating tone of voice during a meeting Wednesday with reporters. “Tracking target movement speed. Twenty knots. Twenty-two knots. Twenty knots. Target acquired. Missiles armed.”“Ready to fire. Ready to fire. Ready to fire. Ready to fire. Ready to fire” the president added.

Could that be it?”“Hmm” Cuthell added.“It’s probably a lot simpler than we’re making it out to be. But what if it isn’t?”After the kickoff event attendees reportedly had the opportunity to sit in on several breakout sessions each with a specific focus including a seminar on parsing the exact phrasing of the comments and inflection of certain syllables an in-depth recap of dozens of past interactions intended to give the latest scenario more context and a body language workshop wherein overthinkers aimed to determine whether the speaker’s posture and arm movements might divulge the actual sentiments underlying their words.Additionally sources said that attendees expanded their inquest by bringing in several outside acquaintances to weigh in on the interaction before ultimately disregarding their input and continuing to follow their own lines of reasoning.“By itself I guess you could say it didn’t mean any more than just the words that were spoken” said Scott Banks of Racine WI one of the top overthinkers present who then placed his chin in his hand looked down at the floor and became lost in thought for several moments. “Of course you have to take into account the other weird thing from last week too.”“It’s probably a lot simpler than we’re making it out to be” he continued before absentmindedly chewing on a fingernail. “But what if it isn’t?”Sources stated that the overthinkers returned to the main auditorium for an afternoon keynote speech titled “The Way It Was Said: Thoughts On Tone Of Voice” before breaking for an hour during which time the majority of attendees reportedly chose to wander listlessly around the convention floor repeating the statement in question to themselves under their breath while cups of coffee grew cold in their hands.According to reports the group later reconvened for a session from 1:00 a.m. to 3:45 a.m. in which they restlessly dissected what had been said word by word.“Maybe it was said in jest” said Plano TX overthinker Rahim Jacobson on the second day of the symposium a suggestion that quickly sparked intense debate among those in attendance. “It’s hard to tell if it was serious or not. But we would know if it was a joke right?”“And who would even joke around like that?” he added.Following three days of feverish discussion a consensus was finally reached Thursday in which participants reportedly agreed to put the whole thing out of their minds after which attendees dispersed from the auditorium only to frantically call a follow-up symposium roughly 10 minutes later when new doubts arose.

But no he just got up and decided to chance it.”“He’s just asking for trouble” Green added.Numerous onlookers said they had “no idea what [Dill] was thinking” pointing out that the table on which the daring man left the 704-page paperback was situated within several paces of the café’s front door which would make it relatively easy for any would-be thief to snatch the 2006 International Thriller Writers Award Nominee and escape from the premises in a matter of seconds.In addition sources noted that Dill’s table abutted the café’s large street-facing window placing the book in plain view of dozens of passersby any of whom could have noticed it was unguarded stepped inside and quietly slipped it under their arm before vanishing.“I hope he knows it’s not our responsibility if anything happens” said barista Leslie Walker referring to the store’s policy of not being held liable for lost or stolen items. “It’s his business if he wants to leave it by itself where everyone can see it but he’s taking a risk. Especially during the morning rush.”“People are going to notice a book like that just sitting on a table” she continued.Many patrons expressed their bafflement to reporters noting that the audacious 36-year-old could have at the very least taken the quick and simple step of hiding his copy of the critically praised sequel to The New York Times bestseller Memorial Day in his backpack which they noted was resting on the seat of an adjacent chair.Moreover a number of customers stated that if it was their copy of the fictional work of geopolitical intrigue they would likely go so far as to take it into the restroom with them.“We’re in a city—this isn’t a small town where you don’t have to worry where you leave your suspense novels” said café patron Angela Vecchio noting that for all Dill knew someone at the next table could have been eyeing the fast-paced third-person account of a high-stakes international manhunt as soon as he took it out and simply been lying in wait for an opportunity to swipe it. “It’s crazy to me that he even chose to bring that thing out in public. It looks practically brand-new.”Added Vecchio “If I had a nice book like that I would definitely leave it at home.”At press time sources reported that Dill had nonchalantly returned from the bathroom and resumed reading evidently unaware how close he had come to never seeing the book that the Minneapolis Star Tribune hailed as a “heavyweight in the political thriller arena” again.
2016-05-25T13:28:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/leaked-documents-reveal-studio-executives-knew-about-g-1819578910,Leaked Documents Reveal Studio Executives Knew About ‘Gods Of Egypt’ Before It Released Onto Public,SANTA MONICA CA—Suggesting that the disastrous events of three months ago could have been averted federal investigators stated Wednesday that a trove of leaked documents confirmed high-ranking studio executives had full knowledge of Gods Of Egypt long before the film was released onto unsuspecting Americans.Sources said the documents—reportedly turned over to the FBI by an anonymous informant at Lionsgate Films—include email correspondence memos and financial records indicating the vast extent of negligence on the part of top-level management who despite knowing of plans to unleash the fantasy-action epic on the public more than three years in advance chose to do nothing.“As early as March 2013 people in key positions at the studio were clearly aware of coordinated efforts to screen Gods Of Egypt in major metropolitan areas across the country” said lead investigator Timothy Benfield pointing out dozens of damning emails to Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer that laid out the film’s disturbing storyline step by step and confirmed its imminent distribution. “Not only did these executives repeatedly fail to act after learning details about the movie’s narrative arc and cast they also neglected to intervene upon discovering the film would be rated PG-13 which ensured that untold numbers of children were directly targeted.”“They had every opportunity to prevent the events of February 26 2016” continued Benfield referring to the now-infamous date of the film’s release. “Yet they simply stood by and watched this senseless tragedy unfold.”According to the FBI’s report the activities and whereabouts of key players in Gods Of Egypt’s production were known to executives for over a decade including those of director Alex Proyas who masterminded similar calamities such as I Robot in 2004 and Knowing in 2009. Studio officials however were said to have stayed silent allowing Gods Of Egypt to continue even after receiving word that Proyas had recruited a team of actors to carry out elaborate fight sequences dressed as 10-foot-tall animal-headed deities.Additionally top brass at Lionsgate reportedly neglected to warn their counterparts overseas setting off a chain of events that ultimately allowed the high-budget adventure film to show on more than 3000 screens around the world resulting in a catastrophe of global scope.“Complete scripts full storyboards and a production timeline crossed the desks of at least a dozen executives and yet they didn’t take the simple step of freezing assets or otherwise preventing the flow of crucial resources from falling into the hands of those responsible for the film” Benfield said. “They were even aware that the crew who pulled off Gods Of Egypt had gotten ahold of IMAX technology potentially putting millions more in the path of the movie.”“And after studio chiefs learned the film would feature two actors riding immense fire-breathing CGI cobras across the desert still no action was taken” added Benfield. “They just watched as all those innocent people bought their tickets and filed into theaters like lambs to the slaughter.”Upon hearing of the leaked documents many of those still traumatized from having witnessed Gods Of Egypt expressed their revulsion at Lionsgate executives for failing to step in and prevent hundreds of thousands of Americans from experiencing 127 unfathomably hellish minutes of horrendous special effects and painful dialogue.“How could any decent person know about this and just let it happen?” said 41-year-old Flagstaff AZ resident Katherine Plante who like thousands of others looked on in abject horror on opening night powerless to do anything as Gerard Butler transformed into a giant gold bird. “Think of all the families who only wanted to have a nice night out together but found themselves in this…this nightmare. It’s devastating to realize it could have been stopped.”Added Plante wiping away a tear “I just hope they never let anything like this happen again.”

However the mobile phones he leaves behind will still be leaching toxic metals into the soil and groundwater thousands of years from now impacting entire populations.”“And just think: That’s one small part of his trash” Wright added. “This man’s waste is going to shape our world for a long time to come.”Researchers noted that while Jacobson has visited a total of just nine U.S. states and one foreign country during his lifetime the influence of his trash has already spread far and wide leaving its mark across the globe. Over the past four decades experts stated the raw tonnage of refuse produced by Jacobson—a man who interacts with at most 12 people in an average week and whose most recognized personal accomplishment is making pretty good lasagna—has crossed oceans and begun bringing about significant changes in marine ecosystems as distant as Asia South America Europe and parts of North Africa.Moreover Jacobson’s discarded cleaning products batteries and takeout containers will reportedly have a considerable effect on the political landscape eventually serving as the source of heated policy discussions and debates—even spurring vast movements of entire civilizations—thousands of years after everything the man has ever said or done has been erased from human society’s collective recollection.Seeking to further elucidate just how profoundly impactful the man’s garbage will be in relation to Jacobson himself experts noted that the Styrofoam packing peanuts that the local resident unthinkingly dumped into his trash can earlier today will still be on earth altering the environment dictating wildlife population numbers and consequently upending food chains a million years from now. By comparison they pointed out the man’s years of productive work will effectively pass in the blink of an eye as will any positive contributions that he makes stemming from his bachelor’s degree in communications his Microsoft Office Specialist certification his participation in online Star Trek forums or any other areas of personal or professional interest where he sought to make a difference.“And it’s not just Jacobson’s trash that will have profound effects on the planet—the emissions that result from him routinely leaving his car running while he waits in parking lots will influence the climate worldwide for an eon and will eradicate not just one but scores of species from the earth’s surface” Wright said. “If you put that next to the most notable goals in his life—running a 5K in less than 25 minutes and sealing his deck by himself without the aid of a professional—the two legacies aren’t even comparable.”“Basically when the last person on earth with any memory of him dies—which by our calculation is little more than 50 or 60 years away—the paint cans and single-serve coffee pods he’s thrown out will just be getting started” Wright continued. “Future generations won’t know the name Aaron Jacobson but rest assured his garbage will leave a mark on each and every one of their lives.”
2016-05-18T11:15:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/wealthy-socialite-falling-for-unrefined-but-beautiful-l-1819578892,Wealthy Socialite Falling For Unrefined But Beautiful Lower-Class Populace,DARIEN CT—Admitting that his affection for their gauche and boorish ways had surprised even himself prominent socialite J. Thomas Donelan III confirmed Wednesday that he was falling for the nation’s unrefined but beautiful lower classes.Donelan an industrialist and avid patron of the arts whose net worth is estimated at $8.6 billion told reporters that while at first he was repulsed by lower-income Americans’ fashion sense eating habits speech and pedestrian interests their simple charms had gradually turned his disdain into fondness and then finally into something closer to love.“For a long time I looked down on ordinary people with their uncultivated tastes for malt beverages and stock car racing but one day something about them just caught my eye” Donelan said as he recalled an incident not long ago when his chauffeur took a wrong exit off the freeway accidentally driving the 59-year-old heir through a working-class neighborhood he had never seen before where he was reportedly taken aback by the humble beauty underneath residents’ Quiznos uniforms and Juicy Couture sweatpants. “As I looked at them I felt strangely drawn to them despite their poorly groomed exteriors and lack of sophistication.”“I can’t say why—maybe it was the twinkle in their eyes as they watched fail videos on their phones or just the way they stood there at their bus stops—but at that moment I just knew I had to see them again” he added.Soon finding himself “quite taken” with the population of Americans making less than $10 per hour Donelan reportedly became convinced that with some work he could turn them into something presentable to society perhaps even one day flying them out to meet and mingle with his fellow upper-class citizens at a gala fundraiser in the Hamptons or accompanying them to an exclusive soiree in the south of France.Brushing aside doubts from his friends and business associates Donelan said he began by trying to make poorer Americans’ appearances “a little more pleasing to the eye.” On trips to bespoke tailors and high-end boutiques he had their wardrobes of football jerseys calf-length mesh shorts Crocs and stretch pants replaced with trunks full of designer garments and top-of-the-line accessories.According to sources the multibillionaire coached the nation’s bottom third of earners on their diction and ultimately hoped to elevate their conversational skills to the point where they would no longer routinely use the phrase “cray cray” or quote lines from Anchorman 2 when meeting members of his social circle. “Getting 70 million people to stop wiping their hands on their pants was an enormous test of patience” said Donelan recalling how difficult it was to instill even the most basic fundamentals of dining etiquette among those American households living on incomes of $42000 or less per year. “I finally resorted to withholding their beloved BK Chicken Fries until they learned how to sit properly and make regular use of a napkin.”“But eventually I discovered that aside from their orange cheese flavoring–coated fingers there was really something quite endearing about them” he continued. “That’s when it occurred to me that if poor people could learn to appreciate my culture and culinary preferences then perhaps I could enjoy their Kid Rock albums and hot wings.”Much to his amazement Donelan said he discovered he had an affinity for some of their favorite pastimes. Together he and the nation’s poor but charming segment of American society have been seen playing scratch-off lotto tickets and visiting local Circle Ks and these days Donelan freely admits he has even become familiar with the names of several well-regarded WWE wrestlers.“I’ve been doing more cooking with the microwave lately and I’ve come to appreciate—even enjoy—eating a warmed-over meal on a sofa in front of this so-called ‘Maury’” Donelan said. “I guess you could say my newfound love for the lower classes has helped me to learn something about myself.”“Namely that I can feel a deep affection for those less fortunate than myself” he added. “As long as they don’t ask for any handouts stay politically unrepresented and take mandatory drug tests.”
2016-05-17T14:49:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/ayahuasca-shaman-dreading-another-week-of-guiding-tech-1819578907,Ayahuasca Shaman Dreading Another Week Of Guiding Tech CEOs To Spiritual Oneness,IQUITOS PERU—Saying he was trying not to think about how awful the next few days would be master ayahuasca shaman Piero Salazar expressed his sense of dread Tuesday as he confirmed his week would once again be spent guiding American tech CEOs to spiritual oneness.Speaking to reporters the practitioner of ancient South American religious rituals involving the hallucinogenic ayahuasca plant explained that while he was ordinarily happy to share his culture’s spiritual wisdom with others the constant stream of wealthy Silicon Valley executives seeking transcendental enlightenment had become an increasingly loathsome and disheartening part of his occupation.“I’m not sure if I can take another one of them telling me how some guy named Ryan or Spencer from their ZogSports league turned them onto ‘the whole ayahuasca thing.’”“These days I can’t even look at my calendar without cringing—it’s pretty much all tech execs” said Salazar adding that he had thought the developed world’s interest in the ayahuasca tea ceremony was generally a positive until it became his full-time job to provide celestial guidance to Bay Area venture capitalists and app founders who had learned about the practice through a Viceland special. “I believe this source of healing should be available to everyone but lately it seems like the people I guide toward a vision of cosmic wholeness are all 32-year-old billionaires hoping to gain a deeper insight into their SEO strategy or whatever.”“In the past month alone we’ve had half of Roku’s board of directors come through here” he continued. “It’s getting kind of depressing.”According to Salazar his despair sets in long before the ayahuasca ritual begins when the executives arriving at his meditation hut immediately start networking with one another and loudly discussing new start-ups they may want to acquire. Once the ceremony begins the visibly disgusted spiritual guide told reporters his ancient shamanic chanting is invariably interrupted by the sound of his guests’ Snapchat and WhatsApp notifications.“I’m not sure if I can take another one of them telling me how some guy named Ryan or Spencer from their ZogSports league turned them onto ‘the whole ayahuasca thing’” said Salazar who reportedly spent years learning to prepare the traditional medicine from psychoactive plants he painstakingly gathers by hand from the rainforest. “Although maybe the most insufferable ones are the guys who keep talking about how this is going to help them to envision new applications for their live-streaming platform.”Wincing he added “Yeah they’re definitely the worst.”Salazar conceded the executives do at least quiet down a little bit once the psychotropic effects of the ayahuasca tea begin to take hold but added that accompanying the hooded sweatshirt–clad tech entrepreneurs on their spiritual journey is both tedious and exasperating and that none ever achieves any kind of unity with the infinite cosmos aside from feeling as if they have a fuller more profound understanding of the “mobile social space.”While stressing that he would never intentionally harm anyone under his shamanistic care Salazar admitted he had on occasion derived satisfaction from watching CFOs from Zynga and Slack vomit all over their $300 sneakers during the purging stage of the ritual.“I know it’s my job to guide them but after meeting these guys the last thing I want to do is witness the visions they have deep in their souls” he said. “Even when I do manage to help one of them overcome a long-held fear it’s always something really boring like anxiety over a patent lawsuit or concerns that one of their seed investors may fall through. And no matter what spiritual experiences they have in the end they all leave even more convinced than ever that their true purpose in life is to invent some new kind of crowdfunding app or teleconferencing software.”“At least you can’t argue with the money” Salazar said. “These people will pay almost anything to escape from themselves for a while.”
2016-05-06T10:35:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/christ-does-soft-return-to-gauge-interest-1819578856,Christ Does Soft Return To Gauge Interest,TOPEKA KS—Descending from on high to gather valuable data on His followers’ preferences Jesus Christ the King of Kings and Lord of Lords was said to be conducting a soft return this week in hopes of gauging interest in His Second Coming.Christ reportedly rolled out a test version of His return in select cities—including Topeka KS Fort Wayne IN and a handful of other locations throughout Christendom—as part of a controlled study to determine who among His flock might look favorably upon a miraculous reappearance and thousand-year reign of their Lord and Savior.“These cities offer good cross-sections of the faithful so we’ll be able to closely evaluate the reaction among the various demographics we’re trying to appeal to” said Christ explaining that representative populations of believers were chosen to partake in the soft return in order to more accurately predict how the various planned elements of the Last Judgment would be received in a real-world setting. “We’ve already seen some interesting results that will help us to fine-tune this thing before we go wide with it.”He added “For example the 18-to-34-year-old population in Topeka didn’t respond well to the booming voice of an archangel and the Trumpet of God announcing my return so that’s definitely something we’ll want to tweak.”According to sources focus groups of local Christians have been assembled in the designated cities and asked to rate as positive negative or neutral their response to certain details of the Second Coming such as an ominous darkening of the horizon flashing white-hot streaks of lightning filling the sky and a great chasm opening in the heavens as the blindingly bright figure of Christ descends to earth.The Only Begotten Son of God admitted to reporters that most of those who witnessed the soft return didn’t like the “dark scary stuff” much at all and that He would have to see what could be done to “lighten things up here and there.” However Christ said most people responded positively to the moment when Satan Prince of Darkness was bound in chains and thrown into a bottomless pit and the subset of believers who were raptured seemed very pleased with the experience.Reports confirmed that all of the study’s participants had ascended into heaven and been given seats at the right hand of the Father in exchange for their time energy and helpful suggestions.“At this stage we’re just trying to get as much feedback as possible so we can work out all the kinks before I actually come again in glory to judge the living and the dead” said Christ adding that while He thought His followers would be excited to see their deceased loved ones again many were in fact completely terrified when He raised the dead from their graves. “We definitely need to work on the optics of our presentation. People were losing interest after the first two or three of the seven seals were opened and that’s a problem.”Christ indicated He would have to consult further with His team before deciding if the time was right to roll out His return on a global scale.“We only have one chance to pull this off so we need to nail down every detail” He said. “Some of this stuff was planned 2000 years ago and I’m just not sure it’s going to work in the present day and age. The whole part about the Antichrist forging a seven-year covenant with Israel for example really seems a bit outdated and might have to be scrapped altogether.”“And if interest in me banishing all evil from the face of the earth just isn’t high enough right now we should go back to the drawing board and maybe do some more trial runs in another millennium or so” Christ added.
2016-05-04T11:28:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/assault-rifle-in-iraq-losing-track-of-how-many-times-it-1819578846,Assault Rifle In Iraq Losing Track Of How Many Times It’s Switched Sides During War,TAL AFAR IRAQ—Admitting it had stopped counting after the first dozen or so occasions upon which it passed from one fighting force to another an American-made M4 carbine assault rifle confirmed Wednesday it was losing track of how many times it had switched sides during the ongoing war in Iraq.According to the standard-issue automatic weapon which was transported to Iraq with the 3rd Infantry Division of the U.S. Army in 2003 it has changed hands so often since arriving in the country that it can no longer remember all the insurgent factions terrorist organizations and military groups it belonged to before ISIS took possession of it last month.“I definitely started out with the Americans—I know that—and then I was with the new Iraqi Army for a while but after that it’s all kind of a blur” the rifle said of its 13 years of near-continuous use in various military operations uprisings and sectarian battles. “At one time or another I’ve been with al-Qaeda in Iraq the Promised Day Brigade some Salafi Islamists a British commando unit the Badr Organization and God knows who else. And if I had to guess I think I’ve been back with the U.S. Army three times. Maybe four.”“And I know I was in Syria a couple times but I honestly couldn’t tell you which side I was on” the 5.56-millimeter firearm added.The gun was able to confirm that when the U.S. military was training a new Iraqi special forces unit in 2004 it fell into the possession of a defector who fled with it to Baghdad’s Sadr City district and joined the Mahdi Army. The rifle indicated that “things get kind of fuzzy” at that point stating that it was pretty sure it was then seized by Blackwater agents during a CIA-ordered raid of insurgents and subsequently sold to a local weapons dealer. It quickly added however that it wasn’t 100 percent positive it was remembering the sequence in the correct order.After that the M4 was reportedly headed out of the country as part of an illicit arms shipment but Kurdish Peshmerga forces intercepted it just short of the Turkish border though the gun acknowledged that it might be confusing that instance with the time it was seized by the Peshmerga in a raid on a terrorist safe house in Mosul.The rifle was unable to confirm its whereabouts at any particular point in the hazy decade that followed suggesting only that it traversed much of Iraq and the surrounding region as it was repeatedly sold stolen seized from weapons caches or pulled from the hands of dead fighters on active battlefields.“I remember shooting at Sunni militants from a car at one point probably around 2007 but then I also have this vague memory of being used to retaliate against their Shia rivals a week or two later—not sure how all that happened” the rifle said. “After a while it’s pointless to try to sort it out. Was I with the Marines in Anbar province during the surge or just lying around in an arms depot somewhere in Baghdad? Hell if I know.”Sources were able to determine the gun had been in Ramadi at various times since the outset of the Iraq War but noted that the city was successively under the control of the U.S.–led multinational coalition a series of Sunni insurgents the Iraqi government the Islamic State and then in late 2015 U.S.–backed Iraqi forces leaving them no closer to determining which side the rifle had served on.“I’ve gotten pretty used to moving around constantly and these days I don’t even really pay attention to the loyalties of whoever’s carrying me” the M4 said. “I’ve always wondered if I might make it back to America someday even though it doesn’t seem very likely anymore.”“But hey who knows” the rifle continued. “I’ve heard I might be going to Europe soon.”
2016-04-28T09:09:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/new-osha-regulations-to-cut-down-on-workplace-mutations-1819578835,New OSHA Regulations To Cut Down On Workplace Mutations,WASHINGTON—In an attempt to address the troubling number of genetic transformations occurring in workplaces across the nation the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration unveiled new regulations this week aimed at reducing on-the-job mutations sources confirmed.While the revised precautions inspection procedures and training requirements apply to all places of work those facilities that engage in bioengineering pharmaceutical development hazardous waste processing and nuclear energy—industries that have all recently seen a sharp uptick in employees sprouting tentacles and compound eyes—are expected to be impacted most by the new protocols.“No one should have to go to work worried they’ll come home with the head of a Venus flytrap.”“Over the past several years we’ve seen far too many workers suddenly develop antennae multiple limbs and other insect-like features prompting us to institute this range of new safety measures” OSHA assistant secretary of labor David Michaels said during a press conference later stressing that compliance with the new rules and screening procedures will protect the American workforce from developing scaly armadillo-like plates in place of their skin as a result of being exposed to toxic materials. “Instead of simply trying to mitigate the situation when say an improperly contained pathogen causes an infected employee to grow functional full-sized mouths on the palms of their hands we should prevent such mishaps from occurring in the first place.”“No one should have to go to work worried they’ll come home with the head of a Venus flytrap” he added citing a recent highly publicized negligence case at a California agrochemical plant in which a valve ruptured leading to a scientist inhaling highly unstable gas compounds that altered his natural genetic makeup.According to a report released by OSHA earlier this month 27 percent of the more than 11000 workers affected in the last calendar year transformed into animal-human hybrids—usually rat-men and rat-women—while 19 percent developed ossified bone exoskeletons. Slightly less than half are said to have suffered from general physical deformities such as the proliferation of excess ears toes and anuses and a small but significant number less than 10 percent were reportedly affected on a quantum level developing mutations that made them age in reverse or rapidly cycle in and out of the visible spectrum.“We learned a valuable lesson when that reactor maintenance procedure went horribly wrong in Toledo” said Michaels in reference to a case in which 144 employees at a nuclear power plant were exposed to radiation that rewrote their DNA causing them to generate tongue cells over every square inch of their bodies and forcing them henceforth to taste every surface they came in contact with. “It’s time we crack down on employers who think their workers’ genome stability is something to be taken for granted.”“We as a country simply cannot look the other way when our hardworking fellow citizens become screaming undifferentiated pools of milky slurry” he continued.After some employers reportedly took issue with the new policies citing the high implementation costs of ventilating fission units or installing new titanium pipes to carry toxic waste OSHA countered by explaining how preventing any chance of employees developing silk-secreting glands spinning cocoons and pupating within them for upwards of three weeks at a time would save companies millions in lost productivity. The agency has also made the case for the regulations from an ethical standpoint arguing that if even one person is saved from a particle collider malfunction that causes them to spontaneously sprout the head of a cobra and the limbs of a mongoose that viciously attack one another all day long then the costs are justified.For many employees in high-risk industries however the recent changes to federal workplace safety laws are reportedly too little too late.“Do you know how hard it is to see your wife try to hide her disgust every time she looks at you?” said former lab technician Timothy Valdez from his scorched and smoldering living room after acute exposure to experimental growth hormones resulted in him developing slick eel-like skin and generating a powerful electrical current that courses through his body and regularly discharges into whatever he touches. “The worst part is all of this could have easily been prevented by just properly labeling the test tubes.”“I just want to be able to hug my kids again” Valdez added.
2016-04-27T08:59:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/officials-starting-to-think-school-just-not-nation-s-th-1819578828,Officials Starting To Think School Just Not Nation’s Thing,WASHINGTON—After years of watching it struggle to perform academically in nearly every area of study U.S. education officials told reporters Wednesday they have begun to think maybe school just isn’t the nation’s thing.Top government administrators who confirmed they had gone to great lengths in recent years to ensure the United States received extra attention in subjects such as math science and the language arts said they have come to believe that at the end of the day perhaps the country simply does not excel in a classroom setting.“When it comes down to it school isn’t for everyone” said Education Secretary John King Jr. who applauded the nation for its efforts but conceded it was time to try something different. “The American people have put their heads down and given it their best shot but something’s just not clicking. While we’ve offered lots of encouragement and plenty of hands-on learning experiences we’ve seen very little in the way of scholastic achievement. We need to accept that maybe the United States just isn’t cut out for this.”“Just because our population doesn’t thrive academically doesn’t mean it can’t go on to have a significant impact on the world.”“Every country learns in its own way” he continued. “And that’s okay.”Officials said they have experimented with an array of different teaching styles but found the nation remained distracted even during one-on-one tutoring sessions and had almost nothing of relevance to say during open classroom discussions. In addition an effort to reach Americans by steering them toward specific areas that might interest them was reportedly abandoned as soon as their general lack of curiosity about any academic subject became apparent.Despite high hopes for such initiatives administrators said that costly programs to introduce laptops and tablet computers into schools have only made the U.S. populace frustrated that even with the assistance of technology it is still unable to grasp basic concepts or solve straightforward problems.According to the government after a last-ditch measure to prescribe attention-deficit medications failed to appreciably improve results it was finally forced to come to terms with the idea that school just isn’t a good fit for the nation’s temperament.“Some countries require a different approach that’s more appropriate for their needs and skill set” said King stressing that the government’s narrow focus on measuring the country’s success in the classroom had only served to make it feel pessimistic and self-conscious about its meager test scores. “Just because our population doesn’t thrive academically doesn’t mean it can’t go on to have a significant impact on the world.”“We’ve given traditional schooling a shot and it simply hasn’t worked out” he added. “Now we just need to find a track that better suits the U.S.”King went on to state that it’s not fair to compare the United States directly to other countries which may benefit from a more stable background and have wider access to important resources. Such comparisons can be discouraging he remarked leading the American public to ask why it should try at all when it knows it will never achieve the kind of academic success enjoyed by South Korea Finland or Japan.“There are other things America can do instead” King said. “For example vocational training can be every bit as useful as higher education. That’s one option.”He added: “And of course there’s always the military. They definitely seem open to that.”
2016-04-13T09:55:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/exxonmobil-ceo-relieved-it-finally-too-late-to-do-anyth-1819578782,ExxonMobil CEO Relieved It Finally Too Late To Do Anything About Climate Change,‘We Really Dodged A Bullet There’ Says ExecutiveIRVING TX—Saying the multinational oil and gas conglomerate had “really dodged a bullet” ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson told reporters Wednesday how relieved he was now that it was finally too late to do anything about climate change.The 64-year-old petroleum executive who acknowledged that throughout his career he had feared the public might take action to curb rising temperatures by imposing emissions restrictions or mandating a switch to alternative energy said he was just happy that the window for avoiding the planet’s environmental destruction had closed and that the entire industry was now free to carry on as usual.“I was really worried for a while there that some kind of law would be passed to stop us from releasing all those hydrocarbons into the atmosphere but I guess not” said Tillerson describing how he felt as if a tremendous weight had been lifted from his shoulders now that catastrophic climate change was an inescapable certainty. “Seriously it’s a huge load off. There were a number of real tense years after the recycling movement picked up momentum when we thought people might all turn away from fossil fuels next. But it’s just so reassuring to know that we passed the point where it’s no longer possible to stop global warming through environmental regulation or green energy or anything like that.”“Now I can finally just relax” he continued. “This really makes things so much easier.”The CEO remarked that back when it was still possible to halt the devastating effects of climate change he constantly feared that the energy industry would be forced to make costly concessions toward sustainability perhaps investing in expensive technology that would reduce oil and gas companies’ environmental impact and thereby severely harm his corporation’s bottom line.Tillerson told reporters that growing public interest in wind and solar energy gave him “a pretty good scare” for a while but noted how he eventually came to realize the public’s engagement was largely limited to vocalizing support for the initiatives rather than taking any substantive action to move the overall energy sector in those directions. He also admitted to losing sleep in 2009 when Congress considered regulating carbon emissions with a cap-and-trade system although he said he now felt silly for ever believing that might actually happen.While he became less worried about the possibility of government regulation after seeing the rapid melting of polar ice caps go completely unchecked Tillerson stated that he was careful not to get his hopes up too high until humanity had blown through every last milestone for averting the worst effects of global warming including atmospheric carbon dioxide surpassing 400 parts per million and average worldwide temperatures exceeding 1 degree Celsius above preindustrial levels.“After scientists started saying we were in the middle of a global mass extinction event and still nobody at any level did anything to try to stop it—that’s when I knew we were in the clear” said Tillerson remarking that by that point he had become certain everyone would just keep driving their gas-powered vehicles and running their air conditioners 24 hours a day no matter what. “There’s just no way people are going to start switching over to renewables at this point. Hell even if the whole world demanded new fuel-efficiency standards today they’d be completely useless now that we’re beyond the point of no return so really why even bother?”“And thank goodness” he added. “Everyone’s complete hopelessness about the whole situation really is the best thing that could have happened to us.”
2016-04-06T15:42:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/new-royal-caribbean-cruise-just-12-day-buffet-on-floor-1819578766,New Royal Caribbean Cruise Just 12-Day Buffet On Floor Of Empty Dockside Warehouse,MIAMI—Telling members of the media Wednesday that the all-inclusive package has already proven popular with American vacationers Royal Caribbean International discussed the launch last month of its newest cruise a 12-day-long continuous buffet set up on the bare concrete floor of an abandoned dockside warehouse. According to Royal Caribbean officials the cruise’s passengers mill around in a dilapidated shipping building on a Fort Lauderdale wharf and eat from a 400-foot-long buffet piled high with generous servings of coconut shrimp macaroni salad chicken fingers and scores of other dishes. Spokespeople for the company confirmed the voyages are booked solid through January 2017.“The new Dockside Getaway package has absolutely everything our customers want” Royal Caribbean hospitality manager Michelle Nakamura told reporters noting that prices for the all-you-can-eat warehouse-based vacation start at $549 before taxes and fees. “Guests simply board through the loading dock drop their luggage anywhere inside the door and all that’s left to do is grab a plate and dig in for the next two weeks.”“The response from passengers has been even more enthusiastic than we anticipated” she continued. “We’ve already had to adjust our supply manifest to make sure we have enough freight containers of sour cream and bacon bits on hand to keep the baked-potato bar replenished.”The massive buffet is believed to be the largest of any leisure cruise service currently in operation both in terms of length and gross food tonnage. Nakamura touted several of its features including 12 separate carving stations where passengers can sample prime rib roast turkey and glazed ham; eight make-your-own sundae bars; multi-tiered chocolate fountains in each of the dimly lit brick building’s four corners; a small salad bar; and 40 square yards of counter space dedicated solely to various gravies and sauces.The company reportedly conducted customer surveys and analyzed consumer data to create the Dockside Getaway which lacks many of the traditional ocean liner amenities and attractions—such as onboard pools and nightly music and comedy performances—but is already said to be generating more revenue than any other Royal Caribbean cruise. Though each guest who books passage to the warehouse receives unlimited buffet privileges those opting for the first-class package are granted extra perks such as larger plates larger bowls and 48-ounce mugs for their soft drinks and juices.Numerous Dockside Getaway patrons—who spoke to reporters over the noise of 5000 fellow vacationers chewing the clanking of steam trays and the periodic sound of several pounds of fresh clam linguini mini meatballs or fried calamari being dumped onto the buffet—explained that the cruise was just the escape they were looking for.“I felt a little sick the first day or two but now I’m having an incredible time” said 51-year-old Dennis Rathborn an orthodontist from Baton Rouge LA who was on his 10th day of the vacation. “Today my wife and I hit the omelet station in the morning and then got lunch over at the build-a-burger counter where we met a real nice couple from Denver. Later on we took a little stroll down to the dessert area and just hung out for a while enjoying our baked Alaskas.”“The crew puts new stuff out every half hour or so and you can go back up there as many times as you want” he added. “I’m just sad we have to leave in a couple days. No question we’re coming back though.”After piling their plates high with crab legs and French fries several passengers were seen retreating to a darkened corner of the warehouse where they peeked out through a small air vent catching a bit of a breeze and a glimpse of an old oil rig on a nearby commercial pier.“I’ve never treated myself to a cruise before—I’m having the time of my life!” said Louise Hellinger 65 a retired receptionist from Indianapolis. “Sometimes the lines get a little long for the breakfast buffet and when you get up there there’s only melon left. But if you’re up and at ’em early enough you sure can eat your money’s worth!”“The cheesecake goes fast” added Hellinger sitting down on a pile of old canvas tarps and tucking into a bowl of lobster bisque.Citing the success of the Dockside Getaway package Royal Caribbean has announced the launch of another new cruise wherein five pounds of heavy hors d’oeuvres will simply be shipped to each vacationer’s home every day for two weeks.

Although he acknowledged he would be sad to no longer see the nation’s middle-income households every day Obama emphasized that the move was only temporary and would give him peace of mind knowing that the middle class was being well taken care of while he and the rest of the U.S. worked through a number of messy issues at home.Sources stated that with the middle class temporarily out of the picture the country will have the space it needs to focus on itself and make some progress on the nagging and deep-rooted problems that have put a strain on it for so long.“We just want to do what’s best for you and right now that means taking you to live up north for the next few months” said the president adding that he and his cabinet members would drive the 120.8 million Americans up to Canada and drop them off at the border. “I’ve already spoken with Prime Minister [Justin] Trudeau and he said they’ve got plenty of room. As you know things have been kind of unstable around here and we think it will make life easier for everyone involved if we get you into some new surroundings away from all the daily struggles you’ve had to put up with lately.”“Plus I really think you’ll like it there” he added. “There’s no need to be nervous; it’s a nice place and I’m sure everyone will be very friendly to you.”Leading members of the House and Senate echoed the president’s sentiment noting that while they still care about the middle 50 percent of income earners very much their incessant fighting and resentful behavior toward one another—especially their heated arguments over money issues—hasn’t always made for the healthiest living environment.Sources stated that with the middle class temporarily out of the picture the country will have the space it needs to focus on itself and make some progress on the nagging and deep-rooted problems that have put a strain on it for so long. However government officials said they didn’t want to make any promises about how long such a resolution might take and advised the middle class to pack their winter clothes just in case.“Once we’ve had some time to work out our issues I promise we’ll bring you right back home okay?” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell forcing a smile as he reminded those households with total annual incomes ranging from $48000 to $145000 that although they’d be separated by some distance he would be just a quick phone call away. “Canada does have some new rules you’ll have to get used to but it’s really not so different.”“They even have a middle class of their own that I’m sure will be excited to meet you” McConnell continued. “I bet you both like a lot of the same things.”McConnell emphasized that the Canadian government already had everything set up to make the American middle class comfortable when they moved in and assured citizens they’d still be able to do everything they’re used to like going out to the mall and watching their favorite TV shows. He also pointed out that the school system in Canada was actually better than the one here and that the area where they’d be staying was much safer too so they could go outside and enjoy the fresh air as much as they wanted.Though many middle-class Americans expressed reservations about leaving their friends and lives back home some said they were excited to go to a new place where they weren’t constantly worrying about their country’s problematic and often erratic behavior and where they didn’t feel so neglected.“Trying to take care of us while dealing with their own problems was clearly putting too much strain on the U.S. so I understand why they felt this was necessary” said 41-year-old Phoenix resident Joshua Roades who said he sometimes felt as if the government would take out its frustrations on him and his fellow middle-class Americans for no apparent reason. “I guess I’m a bit worried about how we’ll fit in there. And I really hope the food’s not gross.”“After the last few years though anywhere will be better than here” he added.

And that’s just one example.”“Our male Barbie could also be a hospital administrator who evaluates Doctor Barbie as she’s making her rounds ultimately deciding which procedures she can and can’t perform” he continued. “Or our new doll could be one of the wealthy and influential owners of the major media corporation for which News Anchor Barbie works. There’s no end to what this new Barbie can do.”Accessories sold separately for the new doll reportedly include a country club playset which allows the new Barbie to play golf while hashing out important business deals with other men and Barbie’s Luxury Owner’s Box where the male doll can take in a sporting event with a male client or a high-ranking male politician while enjoying amenities such as filet mignon and single-malt scotch.Mattel executives have also announced plans for a boardroom playset that lets multiple male Barbies sit around a conference table making long-term strategy decisions while a regular female Barbie sits nearby keeping minutes of the meeting.“Since 1959 Barbie has been inspiring young girls and sparking their creativity” Sinclair said. “We believe that by introducing a male version of the doll girls will be able to see that every opportunity and every avenue for success is open for them to imagine.”“Now girls can truly envision being anything at all” he added.Mattel later confirmed the new male Barbie will only be available in white.
2016-03-25T09:22:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/scientists-slowly-reintroducing-small-group-of-normal-1819578704,Scientists Slowly Reintroducing Small Group Of Normal, Well-Adjusted Humans Into Society,ITHACA NY—In an ambitious attempt to revive a population long considered to be on the brink of extinction scientists announced Friday they have slowly begun to reintroduce normal well-adjusted human beings back into society.According to officials at Cornell University where for the past 18 years conservation researchers have operated an enclosed sanctuary for humans who are levelheaded and make it a habit to think before they speak the endangered group is being cautiously reintegrated into select locations nationwide in hopes that they can reestablish permanent communities and one day thrive again.“We’ve worked for years to stabilize our society’s dwindling population of sane generally reasonable people and within the safe confines of our refuge we’ve finally seen their numbers start to bounce back a little” said Josh Adelson head of the Cornell research team which moved the remaining members of the group into a protected habitat in 1998 to keep them from dying off completely. “Now we can very gradually begin to release this rare breed of rational humans back into the general public. With luck they can survive and prosper.”“Even if this small group of humans able to deal with their negative emotions in a nondestructive manner manages to flourish there’s still no telling whether the next generation will be able to survive.”“Our hope is that within a century or so the traits for making sound long-term decisions and being able to tolerate people different from oneself will propagate and begin to reemerge within the species at large” he continued.Prior to the conservation efforts it is believed that even-tempered people with sound judgment and the ability to put the needs of others before themselves had dwindled to less than 150 within the country’s borders and had gone completely extinct in the nation’s businesses and civic institutions. Experts widely agree that without isolation protection and captive-breeding programs the remaining thoughtful foresighted individuals would have been totally wiped out.While admitting that the project’s reintroduction phase would be complex and its success far from assured Adelson stressed that such measures were nevertheless absolutely necessary if responsible and emotionally mature humans able to see beyond the immediate gratification of their basest desires were ever to reestablish a foothold in society.“Obviously we have taken great precautions before releasing these individuals into an environment where demonstrations of good sense open-mindedness and basic human empathy are perceived as signs of weakness and quickly preyed upon” said Adelson who noted that to ease the transition during their first month acclimating to society the endangered population would be kept away from television the internet advertisements and all other forms of media. “For example we’ve trained them for the inevitable encounters they will face with large groups of people incapable of separating emotions from arguments.”“It hasn’t been easy” Adelson continued. “Last month members of our trial group were confronted by several aggressive and predatory individuals and another was nearly torn apart by angry hordes on social media within just 48 hours of being reintroduced into a metropolitan area forcing us to bring them back to our refuge immediately.”Though researchers have expressed cautious optimism for the reintroduction program many leading scientists have noted that the number of areas in the U.S. capable of sustaining well-adjusted humans has drastically decreased. According to experts there is almost no chance the population will ever thrive again anywhere in the state of Florida.“Even if this small group of humans able to deal with their negative emotions in a nondestructive manner manages to flourish there’s still no telling whether the next generation will be able to survive” Adelson said. “There are a lot of unknown variables and we realize we’re taking a big risk here. But this program is our last best hope of ensuring that people who are willing to go out of their way to help someone who can’t immediately offer them anything in return remain a part of our world.”Top researchers confirmed that it was already far too late to halt the country’s dominant breed of humans—assholes—from spreading uncontrollably to every region on earth.

Sources confirmed that after several moments of gaping a few million Americans opted to cross the street to get a closer look through the chain-link gates at the construction site’s entrance.Throughout the tube’s transit many of the onlookers were said to have briefly turned to the friends family members or strangers standing next to them and mouthed the word “wow” before returning their gaze skyward.“Look how far up it is” said pastry shop worker Kevin Jordan 29 speaking to reporters without breaking his line of sight with the large tube. “That thing’s gotta weigh like 100 tons.”“Oh look you can see through it now” he continued as the tube slowly rotated at the end of its tether.Though completely captivated by the activity many Americans reportedly took a moment to speculate what the big crane would pick up next imagining that it might subsequently lift a humongous steel beam or perhaps a giant bucket of cinder blocks. Others however were quick to point out a large pile of identical concrete tubes at one end of the construction site and suggested these would likely be moved next in a similar manner. “It’s going real slow—they probably have to go so slow because it’s so big” said 38-year-old Gabrielle Cook a mother of three who along with the rest of the nation wondered aloud at one point why the process had momentarily halted. “Oh it stopped. Why’d it stop?”“There it goes again” Cook added.According to an informal poll of onlookers 73 percent of the nation said they had never seen a tube that big before while 24 percent said they’ve seen bigger. The remaining 3 percent either grumbled indecipherably or shushed reporters.Amid audible “oohs” and “ahhs” as the crane began to lower the massive object into place the nation admitted it was still unclear as to the exact function of the tube though many commented that it looked like “a big sewer pipe or something.”“It’d be crazy to be the guy steering that thing” said accounting clerk Jeff Merriwether 26 staring at the cabin sitting atop the body of the crane. “Think how far he has to climb to get up there.”“I bet he’s used to it by now” Merriwether continued.At press time the nation was distracted by a big machine scooping dirt nearby.
2016-03-23T09:21:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/report-leading-cause-of-death-still-venturing-beyond-t-1819578695,Report: Leading Cause Of Death Still Venturing Beyond The Pines,BETHESDA MD—Confirming accounts handed down among townsfolk for generations untold a report released Wednesday by the National Institutes of Health has revealed the top cause of death in the United States is still venturing beyond the pines.The report which analyzed the nation’s mortality data from the past decade found that wandering past the tree line and entering the shadowy depths that lie therein results in approximately 650000 deaths each year. Researchers noted that the risk of meeting a mysterious and deadly fate beyond the pines remained high across all demographics from the purest-hearted children to the most revered town elders.“Our findings indicate that forces unknown lurking among the black pines account for one in every four American deaths” said report co-author Shannon Reid noting that the survival rate for individuals who set foot upon the forest floor and allow the darkness below the boughs to envelop them has held steady at just 2 percent. “Merely straying close to the pines is dangerous but once you pass beneath the thick misty canopy through which no beacon of light can penetrate your risk of death increases dramatically.”She added “Such fatalities continue to occur regularly in part because we have seen no decrease in the number of people hearing otherworldly voices that beckon them into the woods with whispers of ‘This way; follow me.’”According to the report 43 percent of pines-related fatalities are the result of people losing their way on a foggy night 39 percent can be traced to individuals attempting to find a shortcut despite warnings from all those they pass and 18 percent occur when people suddenly awaken in the dead of night walk straight out the door in their bedclothes and pace blindly through the moonlight in the direction of the trees.Researchers warned that since 2010 there has been a startling increase in beyond-the-pines deaths of children under the age of 6 particularly among those who have gone out looking for flowers to make a daisy chain.Most fatalities reportedly occur just before dawn at which time the deceased’s clothing is often discovered neatly laid out at the edge of the woods or a small wooden doll depicting their likeness suddenly appears in their bed. The NIH study confirmed that a very small fraction of those who wander into the pines return alive but experts said these individuals typically remain mute for the rest of their lives and are forever marked by spells of wide-eyed paralysis and a shock of prematurely white hair.“There does appear to be a hereditary risk—people with close relatives who have gone where the tall pines grow are more likely to disappear into the trees themselves” Reid said. “So it is important to know your family history and disregard any dreams you have in which a departed loved one calls out for you to join them in the forest. Doing so is not safe under any circumstance.”Reid told reporters the NIH has undertaken several new initiatives in an attempt to curb the number of deaths in the pines such as stationing old cloaked figures at forks in the road to warn travelers about the strange malevolence that dwells in the heart of the woods and launching an educational campaign to dispel the common misconception that treading into the forbidden grove was perfectly safe under a harvest moon when the light is near bright as day.She also recommended that Americans clip a lock of hair from a young child tie it with a silk ribbon and leave it several paces from the edge of the forest to help ward off the deathly menace.“It’s the kind of thing you never think can happen to your family until one day it does” said Brenna Ayers whose daughter chased her paper kite into the pines last year and never returned. “I miss Maddy every day and the haunting sound of her voice softly reciting nursery rhymes that I hear whenever the wind blows through the trees is no replacement.”Reid added that those looking for more information could visit www.NIH.gov or ask the old woman who lives among the hills.
2016-03-22T15:11:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/world-makes-final-attempt-to-try-to-understand-this-shi-1819578744,World Makes Final Attempt To Try To Understand This Shit,BRUSSELS—In the wake of the terrorist attacks in Brussels that left over 30 dead and more than 100 injured an angry and frustrated global populace collectively announced Tuesday that it would make one last attempt to try to understand this shit.Visibly exasperated residents from every country around the world told reporters that after enduring so much similarly horrific shit in recent years they would give comprehending barbaric acts of violence against innocent civilians and the intensely complex network of factors that motivate them “one more shot” before simply throwing their hands up and giving up entirely.“Okay this is it—I swear to God this is the last time I’m going to sit here and try to make some sense of why these things keep happening why these people are so angry and what if anything we can possibly do to stop them” said 48-year-old Medford OR resident Adam Bennett taking a deep breath and steeling himself for one last effort to gain some insight into this fucking horrible shit. “Look I’ve tried. I’ve tried to sympathize with the struggles of people in impoverished and war-torn countries. I’ve read about fundamentalist religious beliefs and even the economic issues that lead to violence. But I still don’t get it and to be perfectly honest with you at this point I don’t know if I ever will.”“So whatever I learn today is just going to have to do for all the attacks and bombings from here on out because I’ve had it—I’ve fucking had it” Bennett continued. “I’m done.”“The thing is maybe there isn’t anything to understand at all. Maybe this can’t even be comprehended no matter how hard we try.”According to sources the inhabitants of every one of the world’s nations plan to “give it a few more hours tops” to figure out geopolitical and religious tensions throughout the Middle East; the continuing destabilizing effects of U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; the rise and expansion of ISIS; regional turmoil as a result of the Syrian civil war; centuries-long strife between Muslims Jews and Christians; centuries-long strife between Sunni and Shiite Muslims; unrest stemming from British and French governments dividing the Middle East into sovereign states during World War I; the vested interests of Western nations in Middle Eastern oil resources; the ongoing radicalization of young Muslims living in the West; and ultimately what possible psychological conditions could actually lead a person even under extreme duress to make the conscious decision to take the lives of so many others who are simply and peacefully going about their daily lives.Noting repeatedly that they are “sick and fucking tired” of attempting to gain some understanding of this bullshit citizens of Europe Africa North and South America Australia and Asia all confirmed that at this point they’re willing to sit down and read maybe one or two more articles and opinion pieces on the subject before calling it quits.Many across the world however told reporters they didn’t hold much hope for making any sort of breakthrough as to why this shit keeps happening again and again noting that their past efforts to achieve some sort of perspective certainly hadn’t made it any easier to wake up to news that dozens of men women and children were yet again savagely murdered in a public place by a bunch of fanatics convinced that the shit they were doing was somehow justified.“You know I could sit here my entire life trying to figure this shit out and I probably still wouldn’t fully understand it” said 57-year-old Patrice Gomis of Dakar Senegal. “The thing is maybe there isn’t anything to understand at all. Maybe this can’t even be comprehended no matter how hard we try.”“Well” Gomis added sighing “I guess I’ll give it one more go.”Reached for comment government leaders from hundreds of nations expressed similar frustrations over their attempts to make sense of this fucking shit and come up with any realistic ways to prevent the same awful shit from happening in the future.“The attacks in Brussels this morning were appalling tragic and utterly senseless and our thoughts are with the victims and their families” said U.N. secretary-general Ban Ki-moon at a press conference in New York City. “Seriously what the fuck is even happening anymore? Why is the world like this? I’m the secretary-general of the goddamn United Nations and even I don’t understand this shit. Why would anyone ever do this?”“If anyone has any ideas please contact me right away” he added “because seriously this is the last fucking time I put in any effort to figure this shit out.”Despite making one more honest effort to comprehend the causes behind it the worldwide populace sadly confirmed that they already fully understand that this shit will continue happening unabated for the foreseeable future.

At the same time 100 percent of Americans who did not recognize the thing reportedly said they did not like it and found it confusing. However researchers noted that most of those who were exposed to the novel thing a second or third time changed their mind and said they liked it now.In a follow-up study citizens were exposed to a variety of things—celebrities snacks movie franchises corporate logos cultural attitudes and more—only one of which they were familiar with. The study found that 100 percent of those surveyed immediately smiled pointed at the only thing in the group they recognized and said “That one.”“I don’t like new things unless the new thing is a lot like an old thing” said Phoenix resident Jennifer Alvarez 54 explaining that she likes it when someone takes a thing she already enjoys and makes a newer version of it that is almost identical to the original thing. “When a new thing isn’t like any old things I don’t like it at all.”“If a few old things are put together to make a new thing that’s good though” Alvarez added. “I like things like that.”At press time Americans appeared pleased when told that everyone would continue to make and do things they were already familiar with for the foreseeable future.
2016-03-03T14:50:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/obama-transformed-into-20-foot-tall-monster-president-a-1819578666,Obama Transformed Into 20-Foot-Tall Monster President After Being Doused With Job-Growth Chemical,WASHINGTON—Still overcome with shock and terror as they described the horrifying scene that had unfolded before them numerous eyewitnesses confirmed Thursday that after being accidentally exposed to an experimental job-growth chemical Barack Obama has grotesquely mutated into a 20-foot-tall monster president.According to federal officials the grisly metamorphosis took place during a tour of the Labor Department’s underground research and development lab where a sudden pressure overload caused a vat to rupture soaking Obama in a highly unstable serum designed to expand the nation’s workforce. Sources said the president then underwent rapid out-of-control growth leaving him several times larger and uncontrollably aggressive.“My God it was horrible—the president let out this awful scream a look of terror flashed through his eyes and then his body started getting larger and larger bursting through his suit coat and shredding his pants” said Deputy Secretary of Labor Chris Lu explaining how the cowering commander-in-chief fell to his knees and started convulsing after being doused his head lashing back and forth and his voice dropping an octave with each pained guttural moan. “A Secret Service agent ran over to try to help but Obama threw him through a wall. After maybe a minute or two his body became too big for the room and the ceiling crashed down around us and we all started running. That’s when we heard him start roaring something about corporate tax policy.”“The amount of chemical he absorbed was meant to be used over an entire fiscal quarter” Lu continued. “No man is capable of handling that kind of economic stimulation.”Authorities at the scene said chunks of limestone and steel flew in every direction as Obama burst through the outer wall of the Labor Department headquarters and began charging west down Constitution Avenue. The rampaging president was seen smashing cars with his fists and tearing down power lines in rage as he made a direct path toward the Federal Reserve Board building where several police units reportedly opened fire on him only to watch their bullets bounce harmlessly off his impervious skin.According to witness accounts the colossal presidential monster then punched down the doors of the building grabbed cowering Fed chair Janet Yellen by the neck and demanded in a deafening bellow that she cut interest rates to spur job growth before hurling her flimsy body into the nearby Reflecting Pool.Labor Department scientists told reporters that just a single small dose of the chemical Obama was exposed to is capable of producing more than 600000 jobs per month enough to counteract even the worst recessions but in great concentrations the caustic agent can be extremely volatile. Analysts noted that it has never before been deployed in such quantities adding that the nation’s employment production and income outlook under the angry mutant president is beyond the scope of any economic theory.“With such concentrated wage-stimulating and job-creating power inside of him God only knows what the president might be capable of” said Lu explaining that Obama likely isn’t yet aware of his own strength and could become even stronger if he learns to harness the enormous potential for GDP growth within his massive body. “He’s beyond our control now. We can only hope he learns to temper these powers and use them for economic good because the entire free market is at his mercy.”“Dear God what have we unleashed?” he added. “If he gets out into the private sector we’re doomed.”With local law enforcement seemingly powerless to stop him the towering muscle-bound president reportedly escaped the Beltway and bolted northward at a tremendous speed. Sources stated that Obama did not stop running until he reached the New York Stock Exchange where he tore through a wall and began violently ringing the opening bell while screaming about foreign direct investment. According to those present a visibly enraged Obama demanded more American jobs and less outsourcing shouting “Buy buy buy!” and “No selling!” as he smashed video monitors and crushed any traders who did not immediately comply.His feats of economic strength growing with his anger the president is said to have then thrown a city bus into the Lower Manhattan offices of the Securities and Exchange Commission before proceeding to pick up several armored cars and violently shake them until the currency inside fell to the ground and was collected by passing consumers.“President Obama has become a monstrous freak of economics and he must be neutralized” said U.S. National Guard chief Gen. Frank Grass who is leading efforts to subdue the genetically altered head of the executive branch. “By carving a swath of destruction across the Northeast he may have already created more infrastructure-repair jobs than American workers can fill. We have readied numerous armored divisions around the nation’s key financial and manufacturing assets and we’ll be sending in a squadron of Apache attack helicopters to confront him directly. I have given the order to take him out if necessary.”At press time Grass confirmed Obama had been captured and sealed in a prison cell with 10-foot titanium walls in southeastern Michigan as far from the U.S. economy as possible.
2016-02-18T15:13:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/vatican-city-residents-rally-to-save-st-peter-s-basili-1819578627,Vatican City Residents Rally To Save St. Peter’s Basilica From Development,VATICAN CITY—Citing its historical significance and the valuable role it plays in the community residents of Vatican City rallied this week to save St. Peter’s Basilica from being demolished as part of a development project that would convert the site into an expansive residential and retail complex sources reported.Plans to replace the Renaissance-era church with The Vatican Downtown Community Center—informally known as “The Communion”—were reportedly first revealed by representatives of the Miami-based real estate firm RJ Lerneman & Co. during a city council meeting last Friday. The presentation which touted the luxury apartments and high-end storefronts of the six-acre mixed-use development was said to have immediately divided those in attendance sparking an hour of intense back-and-forth debate and ultimately launching the campaign to save the Baroque-style church and Catholic pilgrimage site from destruction.“This church has been an important part of the neighborhood since 1590—we can’t just sit back and allow it to be turned into some big open-air mall” said Annetta Marisco 48 who says she was distraught after seeing the illustrated design renderings and 3D scale models of the sprawling complex that Vatican officials put on public display in the Blessed Sacrament Chapel. “Sure it’s a little outdated but it’s got a ton of character and I honestly can’t imagine the piazza without it.”“Do we really want the Vatican to be just like every other city in Italy?” she continued.According to critics the proposed design—consisting of several seven-story steel-and-glass condominium buildings each with ground-floor premium-brand retailers and terrace cafés as well as a winding promenade featuring numerous green spaces and a bike path—was hastily approved by Vatican City officials without any formal input from the community. Drawing more ire from those opposed to the project developers recently confirmed that J.Crew Regal Cinemas and restaurant chain Johnny Rockets have already committed to leasing space in the complex that is to be erected on the plot of land where St. Peter was said to be crucified during the reign of Roman emperor Nero.In addition to draping a large “Save Our Basilica” banner over the church’s travertine facade opponents of the development have reportedly organized a petition drive and letter-writing campaign to voice their objections to The Communion reportedly sending city leaders over 3000 pieces of mail pleading with them to reconsider destroying the church commissioned by Pope Julius II and designed in part by Raphael.Those protesting the proposed downtown center were also quick to dismiss the developers’ plans to preserve Michelangelo’s Pietà by placing it near the entrance of the property’s Nike Town athletics store arguing that the effort was merely a token gesture designed to appease those who wished to save the 500-year-old holy site and tomb of one of Christ’s apostles.“They’re not even trying to make these new buildings blend in with the traditional architecture” said Alfredo Truglio another opponent of the plan who argued that the sleek modernist complex will clash with the square’s Tuscan colonnades the more than 100 10-foot-tall sculptures of Catholic saints and the red granite Egyptian obelisk transplanted to the piazza in 37 AD. “Maybe I’m just old-fashioned but to me it will just look so bleak and sterile. If it goes through I’m never setting foot in that monstrosity.”“Unfortunately the whole town is going this way” he continued. “Just watch—I’ll bet the Barberini gardens are going to be next.”During a recent “Save St. Peter’s!” charity auction held to raise funds for their preservation efforts several organizers expressed their disappointment with the majority of cardinals who have declared support for the project saying they should understand more than anyone the importance of protecting a church many residents have attended since they were children and that houses the remains of over 90 popes.When asked for comment Vatican officials stated that while the crown jewel of Western Christendom will be missed the development project will finally create a centralized community space for residents and also provide a boost to the ecclesiastical state’s economy.“I actually think it will be nice to finally have a 24-hour CVS” said Giovanni Antolini a supporter of the proposal who added that in addition to creating hundreds of construction jobs The Communion is creating a buzz he believes has been lacking in the Vatican in recent years “Yes it’s a nice church but people need to accept that times are changing and that this is the future of Vatican City.”“If people want to go to church they can always head to St. John Lateran right up the road” he added.At press time a work crew was seen tossing sections of pews and various reliquaries into a large roll-off waste container parked on St. Peter’s Square.

The president also speculated that the sheer amount the nation had on its plate had contributed to its low energy and lack of focus noting that it was hard for the populace to even know where to start when it felt so overwhelmed.“It’s pretty clear no one wants to be here today” Obama said after noting that he had spent the last two hours sitting at his desk and had “gotten maybe like one thing done.” “If we all go home and get a good night’s sleep it’s going to be a lot better for us in the long run than just putzing around here.”Sympathizing with his fellow citizens Obama admitted that he had struggled to really dig in and get things done today having instead frequently found himself watching YouTube videos he had already seen a dozen times or standing up from his chair and wandering to another part of the White House with no real aim or motive.Furthermore he said when the majority of the country’s population was drumming their fingers on their desks staring off into space or mindlessly refreshing their favorite website’s homepage every few minutes it was pretty clear they had long since reached the limit of their effectiveness.The president concluded his address by saying that the public banging its head against a wall wasn’t going to help anyone and could possibly do more harm than good. As a solution he argued cutting the nation loose a little early and giving everyone a break would ensure the day wasn’t a complete waste. “Go home—just try to relax and get those batteries recharged” Obama said. “Put all this stuff out of your mind for an evening. After all it’ll still be here tomorrow.”Before putting on his overcoat and heading out Obama promised to pick up coffee and 200 million doughnuts on his way in tomorrow morning.
2016-02-04T08:48:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/parallel-world-leaders-meet-in-washington-for-interdime-1819578579,Parallel World Leaders Meet In Washington For Interdimensional Summit,WASHINGTON—Teleporting via wormhole from points across all of space and time thousands of parallel world leaders have arrived in Washington D.C. for this year’s interdimensional summit sources reported Wednesday.Organizers confirmed President Obama has greeted heads of state from more than 2000 alternative realities a gathering of leaders that includes 139 different versions of himself a parallel U.S. president Mitt Romney a pulsing being of pure electrostatic energy Earth-7491’s King Lyndon B. Johnson IV and a hooded group of unspeaking figures known only as “the Council.”The annual talks are expected to focus once again on brokering trade agreements among the parallel worlds as well as officially admitting the governments of Neo-Pangea and the Corporate States of America LLC into the group and confronting the Roman Empire’s continued tyranny across much of the infinite set of possible world histories.The Washington summit marks the third annual interdimensional gathering of parallel world leaders following last year’s summit in Stalingrad and the 2014 summit held in a boundless expanse of undifferentiated grayness.“Though we hail from vastly different cultures political systems and laws of physics today we gather together to address the most pressing challenges of the multiverse head-on” said Supreme Leader Michael Dukakis president for life of the Pan-American People’s Republic giving the summit’s opening address. “We must work together to fight the spread of hyperspatial neuro-pox address the plight of refugees fleeing those universes that are rapidly contracting to a single point and find ways to manage our respective Israeli-Palestinian conflicts.”Dukakis later added “I’d like to extend a special hello to those joining us by video conference an accommodation we’ve provided to those distinguished leaders who could not be here in person because they cannot exist in fewer than 27 dimensions.”According to sources the tensest moment of the talks so far came about when a conjoined symbiotic entity composed of three Chancellor Angela Merkels arose and called for severing diplomatic relations with Earth-214X1 whose lengthy list of human rights abuses allegedly includes institutional discrimination and often brutal violence against left-handed peoples. The proposal reportedly led to heated debate among the delegates with several representatives storming out of the proceedings either in protest or to be resupplied with life-sustaining strontium.In a smaller breakout session held later in the day however representatives from Adams D.C. reportedly achieved a major diplomatic victory after convincing recalcitrant delegates from New Tehran to submit to periodic third-party inspections of their telepathic weapons program.On the agenda for later this week high-ranking officials will discuss the future of the General Treaty of the Known Cosmological Expanse which has been in effect since interdimensional standard year 10494385 but in recent eons has been violated repeatedly by the sentient bubbles of probability that inhabit Earth-4201(i2). Sources said the assembled leaders may vote as early as Saturday on whether to impose Bayesian statistical sanctions on the beings.“The worlds represented here have engaged in their fair share of feuds in the past between different ethnic groups within the various digitized clone populations and of course along mammal-reptile lines” said a fetal diplomat known only as Riley from within his computer-controlled amniotic mech-sac. “But we always seem to find common ground. Most recently we worked together to liberate millions from beneath the draconian boot heel of the Swiss.”The Washington summit marks the third annual interdimensional gathering of parallel world leaders following last year’s summit in Stalingrad and the 2014 summit held in a boundless expanse of undifferentiated grayness.The key moment of the proceedings is likely to arrive tomorrow according to experts when President Obama is scheduled to come face-to-face with the 18-foot-tall half-human half-prawn Galactic Overlord Obama. Political analysts have stated that if the president offers to shake one of the 26 hands of his crustaceanoid counterpart it could signal a willingness to negotiate but he may well avoid the handshake fearing the gesture could be mistakenly interpreted as a sign that he tacitly accepts the overlord’s trafficking in mind-slaves from the Hyades cluster.A number of experts however have criticized the summit arguing that it brings together only representatives from the largest superpower universes and neglects the innumerable other realities of the broader multiverse providing little more than a photo op for those members of the elite group who appear in the visible spectrum.“The interdimensional summit has been accused of failing to address the most pervasive problems in the totality of existence and that’s a fair criticism” said 21st-term U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt. “I agree that we’ve come up short on many important issues. Honestly I’m just hoping this time around we finally find the collective will to stand up to Vladimir Putin.”“Especially before he evolves from his larval form into a far more dangerous full-grown adult” he added.
2016-01-25T08:36:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/disney-world-opens-new-ordeal-kingdom-for-family-meltdo-1819578568,Disney World Opens New Ordeal Kingdom For Family Meltdowns,BAY LAKE FL—Touting the new property’s wide variety of unique and imaginative attractions representatives from the Walt Disney World Resort announced Monday the opening of Ordeal Kingdom a new theme park specifically designed for full-scale family meltdowns.Situated between Epcot and the Magic Kingdom the 350-acre property reportedly incorporates many of the most aggravating elements of Disney’s other parks and expands them into a creative and fully immersive world of irritation which is said to include the longest lines in the entire resort a convoluted layout that is only depicted in indecipherable cartoon maps that are not to scale and 150 percent higher prices. According to park director Jacob Bartlett Ordeal Kingdom’s specialized combination of features will ensure a slowly building resentment among visiting families eventually resulting in a dramatic public outburst followed by a silent walk back to the car.“We’ve considered every detail to ensure parents and their kids have the heated argument of a lifetime” said Bartlett explaining that the park was split into five themed “lands” including Fatigue Island and Hunger Lagoon each of which can be reached by Mickey’s Congestion Junction Railway. “Whether it’s the sheer distance between rides or the unspecified bathroom locations every aspect of the experience is guaranteed to ratchet up the tension until you and your family are screaming at each other and saying you should never have come in the first place.”“No trip to Disney is complete without everyone in your party losing all emotional self-control” Bartlett continued. “And at Ordeal Kingdom we promise that all your wildest family blowups will come to life!”According to Bartlett considerable effort was devoted to crafting the park’s overall aesthetic which emphasizes open unshaded stretches of asphalt without any benches for resting. Additionally no lockers have been provided anywhere on the grounds encouraging guests to carry their bags and souvenirs around with them all day often over stretches of quaint uneven cobblestone.Bartlett went on to add that the Disney FastPass service will be available in the new park giving irritable visitors the opportunity to squabble over whether they wasted their no-wait ride selection too early in the day.One of Ordeal Kingdom’s most popular attractions is expected to be Tarzan Adventure a kid-friendly obstacle course that provides dozens of opportunities for parents to lose track of their children among twists and turns as they struggle to make their voices heard over loud jungle sound effects. Park officials explained that the design is intended to sow seeds of resentment toward whichever parent insisted that the attraction’s deliberately vague age requirements could be ignored contributing to the eventual fiery altercation that officials expect to boil over at an understocked gift shop or a snack stand selling $11 soft pretzels.“We provide the rides games and entertainment and you do the rest—whether you opt to loudly belittle your spouse on the teacups ride or wait until you’re in your hotel room later that night to call your 8-year-old son an ungrateful little shit Ordeal Kingdom is perfect for families of all kinds” said Bartlett raising his voice over the park’s theme song which blares on a continuous loop from loudspeakers throughout the entire property. “Who knows? Maybe your family will have that special Disney shouting match as soon as you enter the park right after you shell out 75 bucks for your daughter’s ticket only to have her scream right in your face that she hates you.”Officials noted that Ordeal Kingdom also features live shows on five different stages each one tailored to appeal exclusively to one gender and age group with all shows occurring simultaneously once per day during lunchtime. In addition the property hosts a number of three-hour-long parades throughout the day that can be viewed from designated obstructed viewpoints.Furthermore sources confirmed that numerous Disney characters all from the 1985 movie The Black Cauldron would be wandering the park for visitors to meet and take photos with.“We want your family to have a one-of-a-kind experience while you’re here which is why Disney employees will be on hand throughout the park to wish you ‘a magical day’” said Bartlett referring to the greeting that will begin to sound more and more like a taunt as the afternoon wears on. “Plus as one final treat you’ll find the parking lots completely unmarked providing one last special opportunity for family members to cry yell and pitch a hysterical fit—regardless of how young or old they are—when it takes more than an hour to find the car!”Added Bartlett “Our goal is to leave every one of our guests with memories that will last a lifetime.”
2016-01-21T13:28:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/pentagon-holds-gala-to-celebrate-25-years-of-bombing-ir-1819578553,Pentagon Holds Gala To Celebrate 25 Years Of Bombing Iraq,WASHINGTON—Bringing together the many civilian leaders and military strategists who helped them reach such a historic milestone Pentagon officials held a lavish black-tie gala Sunday at which sources said they commemorated 25 years of the United States bombing Iraq.Hundreds of active-duty and retired military officers high-ranking members of the past four presidential administrations and executives from top defense contractors reportedly gathered in the grand ballroom of D.C.’s Fairmont Hotel to dine mingle and celebrate a quarter century spent routinely dropping thousands of tons of explosive ordnance across the Middle Eastern nation—from the Jan. 17 1991 onset of airstrikes in the Gulf War to the current bombardment of suspected ISIS targets.“I’ll never forget that morning 25 years ago when our first strike force of stealth bombers flew in and just unloaded on Baghdad” said the evening’s keynote speaker Dick Cheney who served as defense secretary during the Gulf War vice president during the Iraq War and in the intervening years CEO of the oil field services company Halliburton. “And then we started letting them have it with our Tomahawk cruise missiles too. If you’d told me back then we’d still be pounding some of those very same targets today I wouldn’t have believed you.”“But hundreds of thousands of bombs later here we are!” Cheney added to thunderous applause. “And it’s all thanks to the dedication and resolve of the people in this room.”Leading the gala’s impressive guest list were Presidents George H.W. Bush Bill Clinton George W. Bush and Barack Obama who according to reports spent much of the evening exchanging stories—some old some new—of their respective experiences demolishing Fallujah Mosul Anbar Province the Sunni Triangle and countless other locations. The former commanders-in-chief reportedly shared the head table with a delegation from the neoconservative think tank Project for the New American Century and members of the Saudi royal family whom Cheney praised as “staunch allies through this whole thing.”Also present were Iraq War architects Condoleezza Rice Paul Wolfowitz Doug Feith and Richard Perle who admitted to reporters they felt overwhelmed by nostalgia throughout the event as they reconnected with old faces and shared laughs over the discredited intelligence that served as the basis for military action. Reportedly seated nearby were journalists Judith Miller and Bill Keller who received a special commendation for their work covering the run-up to the 2003 invasion for The New York Times drawing one of the largest standing ovations of the night.Representatives from Lockheed Martin Boeing Northrup Grumman and other weapons manufacturers were honored as well and thanked for donating the gala’s elaborate ice sculptures that depicted a vintage Raytheon-designed Patriot missile from Operation Desert Storm a 2003-era cluster bomb now banned by most countries and a modern MQ-9 Reaper UAV armed with Hellfire missiles and 500-pound munitions.“This is a truly magnificent night—I just wish Gen. [Norman] Schwarzkopf were here to see it” said retired Gen. Raymond T. Odierno during a portion of the evening’s ceremonies that paid tribute to all the commanders of U.S. forces in Iraq over the years. “Twenty-five years ago I was only a major still in my 30s and I really looked up to that guy. I never thought I’d get a chance to do what he did but a couple decades later there I was ordering some of the very same bombing runs that he had. I modeled my entire career after his and feel privileged to have followed so closely in his footsteps.”“It’s especially important that we take a moment tonight to honor our legacy in Iraq so that today’s troops can fully appreciate the rich history of our military campaigns there” continued Odierno “as most of them weren’t born yet when we started bombing the place.”According to attendees the gala featured an elaborate multimedia presentation titled A Generation Of Commitment which began with a montage of night-vision targeting footage from Desert Storm interspersed with reports from up-and-coming CNN correspondent Wolf Blitzer. A segment called “The Clinton Years: A Retrospective” showed F-16 fighter jets enforcing no-fly zones and then rolled highlights from Operation Desert Fox while Outkast’s 2000 recording “B.O.B (Bombs Over Baghdad)” played in the background.The presentation’s survey of Operation Iraqi Freedom included video of then–Secretary of State Colin Powell assuring the U.N. that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction a May 2003 clip of a flight suit–clad George W. Bush landing on an aircraft carrier adorned with a “Mission Accomplished” banner and a July 2003 clip of Bush saying “Bring ’em on” in response to questions about the rapidly growing Iraqi insurgency.The final segment “Drones: The Game-Changer” showed images taken just last week of airmen in a small computer room in Nevada bombing Iraq using joysticks and real-time video feeds.“Sure we’ve been through some hard times especially those dark days in 2012 and 2013 when we pretty much stopped bombing Iraq entirely” former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said in his closing remarks to the group raising a glass of champagne as the room followed suit. “But we started right up again like we always do and we’ve seen thousands of new airstrikes since. Our enemy may change but from Saddam to the Islamic State—and through all the I-don’t-know-how-many insurgencies in between—our mission has remained the same. We’ve stayed true to our roots and kept the tradition of bombing Iraq alive.”Added Rumsfeld “Here’s to 25 more years!”
2016-01-20T07:00:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/khalid-sheikh-mohammed-reluctantly-accepts-alternative-1819578552,Khalid Sheikh Mohammed Reluctantly Accepts Alternative Sentence Of Coaching Troublesome Youth Sports Team,NEW YORK—In a deal that spared him capital punishment for his alleged orchestration of the 9/11 attacks former al-Qaeda operative Khalid Sheikh Mohammed reluctantly accepted a judge’s alternative sentence requiring him to coach a disorderly youth baseball team sources confirmed Wednesday.A court brief made public this week has revealed that last year federal judge Jonathan Ward ordered Mohammed to manage the 0-6 Rockets of the Sayville Long Island Little League for 60 days saying that he hoped the onetime terrorist network leader might be able to learn some valuable lessons by working with the troubled but pugnacious 12-year-olds.The team had developed a reputation in the league for poor play and mischievous behavior local sources said and were in desperate need of a coach after their previous three quit in frustration.“All right guys let’s get something straight—I don’t want to be here and you don’t want to be here so let’s just try to get this season over with” the organizer of the deadliest terror attack in modern history reportedly said when first meeting the rambunctious youngsters in their overgrown practice field where trash can lids were used as bases and the entire team was sharing a single worn-out ball. “The U.S. District Court for Southern New York says that for the next two months you guys are my problem so let’s lay down some ground rules. You can call me Coach M. There’s no more fighting no more swearing and no more stealing gear from the other team. Got it?”“Now which one of you knuckleheads is my shortstop?” he continued.Mohammed who arrived with the same beat-up glove he had used since high school is said to have spent the first practice looking on in disgust as his players missed wildly on throws to first base allowed grounders to roll between their legs and collided while chasing fly balls in the outfield. He was later seen burying his head in his hands when a player swung at a pitch missed and accidentally sent his bat flying into the bleachers.According to league records the team lost their first five games under the radical Islamist who spent most of his time smoking cigarettes in the dugout. When they played the first-place undefeated Knights a team from across town the Rockets reportedly gave up 15 runs before instigating a bench-clearing brawl in the fourth inning.Witnesses confirmed that this was one of several occasions in which the dumbfounded coach was overheard saying that he “should have just chosen the execution.”“Come on Sabatino get it together!” the former head of propaganda for Osama bin Laden shouted at his overweight loudmouthed catcher when during one of the team’s many blowouts the boy let a pitch sail by him because he became distracted by a group of girls in the stands. “What’d I tell you about keeping your eye on the game? It’s all about focus focus focus! That goes for all of you!”“Or are you goofballs content being the laughingstock of the whole damn league?” he added.Sayville residents told reporters that the Rockets reached a turning point midseason not long after Mohammed walking home from another disappointing loss spotted a boy hurling rocks through the windows of an abandoned warehouse. Recognizing the young misfit’s powerful arm the veteran mujahid recruited him on the spot and during the following day’s practice the team reportedly looked on in wide-eyed amazement as the boy delivered a fastball with such velocity that it sent the catcher tumbling onto his back.United behind their new ace pitcher the team reportedly began to climb in the standings and according to witnesses a reenergized Mohammed started to forge a bond with his young players even providing the Rockets with brand-new team uniforms paid for by members of the Saudi royal family.Around the same time sources reported Mohammed began to fall for the beautiful single mother of his shy first baseman.“You know I used to be a lot like you guys when I was younger” the longtime Guantánamo and CIA black site inmate said to the kids seated in his rusted old Dodge Caravan as he took them on a long road trip to an away game. “I used to feel frustrated and resentful all the time and it seemed like no one was listening. I started hanging around with the wrong kind of guys and we ended up doing some really dumb things. I guess I just don’t want to see you guys make the same mistakes I made.”“Oh man somebody open a window” he added several moments later.Following a magical run through the playoffs—which saw home run–saving catches near-perfect pitching and the successful deployment of their “Sayville Surprise” trick pickoff play in the semifinals—the Rockets were scheduled to face the still-unbeaten Knights in the championship game league sources confirmed.However court records indicate that just as the big game approached Judge Ward called Mohammed to tell him his 60 days of service were complete. The man who has been linked to attacks in Kenya Tanzania Indonesia Yemen Kuwait and Tunisia in addition to the United States is said to have called a team meeting to tell his disappointed players that they would have to win without him prompting the boys to shake their heads in disgust and conclude that their coach didn’t actually care about them after all.As he packed his suitcase to head back to Pakistan Mohammed reportedly found in the pocket of his jacket a crumpled-up handwritten batting order from his first Rockets game and it is believed that he suddenly became emotional ultimately deciding that he could not miss the team’s shot at the league title.“Hey why aren’t you guys warming up?” said the man who once had a $5 million bounty placed on his head by the U.S. government arriving just minutes before the game to find his players who believed they stood no chance of winning without their coach sitting dejectedly in the dugout. “You guys know I’d never walk away with the championship on the line. We’ve been through too much. Schuster get that cannon of yours loosened up. The rest of you guys start fielding some ground balls!”“Let’s show them what the Rockets are made of!” he added.Fans stated that despite being outmatched in size and skill at every position the team remained even with the Knights until the bottom of the ninth inning when with two outs tiny left fielder Timmy “Squeaks” Reynolds walked to the plate. Reportedly remembering what Coach M. had told him about big things coming in small packages the scrawny child then belted a walk-off home run.According to sources every jaw in the crowd dropped a roar of applause erupted and the victorious Rockets swarmed Mohammed in a celebratory dogpile.“At first I didn’t want anything to do with coaching this team because all I really cared about was myself” the terrorist mastermind said during a postgame speech. “But you boys taught me what it means to believe in something bigger than yourself and for the first time in my life I found something I really truly cared about. I’m sure gonna miss you guys.”“I hope you all know I’ll always be a Rocket” a teary-eyed Mohammed continued.At press time authorities confirmed the whereabouts of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed are unknown.
2016-01-14T13:28:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/monsanto-lab-on-lockdown-after-scientists-find-shattere-1819578546,Monsanto Lab On Lockdown After Scientists Find Shattered Tomato Containment Unit,SOCORRO NM—Initiating emergency procedures and sealing security doors throughout the complex scientists at Monsanto reportedly placed the agrochemical company’s main laboratory on lockdown Thursday after discovering a shattered empty tomato containment unit.According to sources onsite technicians arrived at the lab’s secure vegetable isolation chamber at 8 a.m. to find the room’s armed guards lying dead on the floor next to what remained of Specimen 323-A’s 6-inch-thick tempered-glass container which appeared to have been ruptured from the inside.Officials would not confirm how many employees had been killed but acknowledged the released tomato variety remained at large within the sprawling crop development facility.“We have suffered a Code 9 containment breach” said head biotechnologist Stewart Klein explaining that he had used a dedicated emergency line to contact Monsanto headquarters in St. Louis which immediately sent back a directive ordering all laboratory personnel to shelter in place until further notice. “As of now we’ve sealed off all stairwells below subbasement 12 but this hardy disease-resistant tomato appears to have overridden all of our fail-safe backup protocols. We have an asset on the loose and nobody will be allowed in or out until this thing is stopped.”“This is our worst nightmare” Klein added.The laboratory which handles nearly all of Monsanto’s agricultural production reportedly features a wide array of state-of-the-art security systems including biometric locks 24-hour checkpoints and a centralized surveillance system that closely monitors the company’s fruits vegetables grains and other specimens through every stage of their creation and growth. As an additional precaution sources confirmed the entire facility is buried more than 1000 feet below the New Mexico desert.Monsanto scientists said they had traced the escaped tomato’s path of destruction from the broken shards of the containment unit to the lifeless bodies of the guards to a nearby ventilation shaft following a trail of viscous bright red liquid that appears to be composed of fructose glucose vitamin C several unknown substances and human blood.The rogue produce has since found its way into the facility’s germination module according to reports where it is believed to have consumed dozens of experimental fertilizers and a generous supply of mulch possibly attempting to increase its size strength and shelf life.“We’ve been trying to find some way to take this thing down but so far nothing’s worked” said Monsanto security chief Lydia Jarrett citing steel doors torn completely from their hinges tunnels bored through solid concrete by means of a highly concentrated form of citric acid and the failure of industrial-strength herbicides pouring from the facility’s sprinkler system to slow any of the destruction. “We used a trellis and a bed of fresh loamy soil to lure it into a waste processing bay where we intended to have it incinerated—that is if anything can still hurt it at this point—but it escaped at the last minute. It’s almost as if it knew what we were planning.”“This tomato is adapting to our strategies” Jarrett continued. “It’s learning.”In their desperate attempts to regain control of the escaped specimen Monsanto officials told reporters they were trying to track down any surviving scientists from the ConAgra Disaster of 1994 in which a genetically modified variety of wild rice was inadvertently crossbred with a fast-growing form of sweet corn with the resulting hybrid quickly bursting out of its greenhouse and overrunning a 3000-acre stretch of central Nebraska leaving 11 dead and causing more than $90 million in infrastructure damage.“We’re running out of time” said Klein solemnly noting that if necessary his entire team was prepared to stay in the underground laboratory and make the ultimate sacrifice should their containment efforts fail. “Once emergency protocols are activated a six-hour countdown begins at the end of which thermonuclear charges will vaporize this facility and everything within a 15-mile radius. It’ll kill us all but better we die than let that thing get to the surface.”He added “May God have mercy on our souls if this thing pollinates.”Klein went on to state that if the escaped tomato specimen could be safely recaptured it would be marketed under the trade name Ruby Gold.
2016-01-11T11:35:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/coca-cola-marketing-strategist-named-new-united-states-1819578518,Coca-Cola Marketing Strategist Named New United States PR Laureate,WASHINGTON—In a ceremony at the White House this morning in which his work was praised for its unique contributions to the art of corporate communications Coca-Cola marketing strategist Lawrence Shaffer was officially appointed as the new PR laureate of the United States sources confirmed.During a reception in the East Room members of the PR laureate selection committee told reporters they spent weeks debating the merits of the nation’s most talented public relations professionals before deciding on Shaffer whom they described as an “adroit and truly consummate” practitioner of brand messaging one with a remarkable ability to push product and get people to connect emotionally with business entities.“Lawrence Shaffer has a rare knack for both strategic brand partnerships and social media integration that makes him a modern-day master of corporate image management” said White House press secretary Josh Earnest who commended Shaffer for mining the richness and diversity of the American experience in his work citing in particular his oversight of the 2014 “Share a Coke” campaign. “As a young man he burst onto the PR scene after leveraging his press relationships to help oil executives shape the narrative emerging in the public consciousness following the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989. The press conferences he orchestrated then were so deft and nuanced.”“But it is at Coca-Cola that his marketing strategies have left their most indelible mark on the imagination of the American consumer” Earnest continued. “For evidence of that we need look no further than the company’s recent collaboration with cosmetics manufacturer OPI to create soft drink–inspired nail polish colors. It’s truly breathtaking.”Officials confirmed that as PR laureate Shaffer will be allowed to conduct market research using the federal government’s complete census records. He will also receive a yearly stipend of $600000 which is intended to give recipients the freedom to pursue passion projects and push the boundaries of public relations as they experiment with innovative new approaches to brand messaging.According to sources Shaffer’s foremost duty as laureate will be to champion PR and inspire the American public to become enthusiastic about the practice of mediating the flow of information between corporate actors and the public. He also reportedly plans to visit the nation’s classrooms where he will teach schoolchildren the importance of developing strong media contacts and learning to conduct damage control in the face of a potentially reputation-damaging crisis.Those in attendance at the White House reception were reportedly treated to a live reading of Shaffer’s most effective and convincing press releases from the past 30 years.“Perhaps no one in American marketing is as bold and elegant when it comes to dissecting demographics and pinpointing their vulnerabilities and deepest desires” said Earnest who praised Shaffer’s ability to meld disparate publicity techniques into a cohesive vision of brand identity. “With a few simple words he pulls you into the world of wonder and contentment his clients can provide. His work lodges itself deeply within the psyche of the consumer and it stays there—often for a lifetime.”He added “I know that I personally have had the ‘Always Coca-Cola’ song stuck in my head on and off for more than two decades and I have no reason to believe that won’t continue to be the case until the day I die.”The office of PR laureate was created in 1928 by President Calvin Coolidge who appointed advertising executive Albert Lasker to the post for his pioneering work in sponsored entertainment with The Palmolive Hour radio show. More recent holders of the position include Reagan-era laureate Alan Hilburg the critically acclaimed creator of Wendy’s “Where’s the beef?” campaign and marketing guru Tim Arnold whose widely heralded decision to hire Lou Rawls as a celebrity spokesman for Budweiser allowed Anheuser-Busch to successfully target African Americans in the 1970s.At press time sources said the White House press secretary was asking the PR laureate if he knew the best way to spin a report that six foreign aid workers had been mistakenly killed by a U.S. airstrike in Syria.
2016-01-05T06:00:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/vatican-tour-group-catches-glimpse-of-pale-emaciated-j-1819578499,Vatican Tour Group Catches Glimpse Of Pale, Emaciated Joseph Ratzinger Scuttling Into Dark Catacombs,VATICAN CITY—Following a guided tour of the excavated ruins beneath St. Peter’s Basilica on Tuesday several stunned members of a Vatican sightseeing group told reporters they had glimpsed a gaunt and haggard Joseph Ratzinger as he scuttled past them in the dark corridors of the subterranean burial site.As they approached the deepest recesses of the Vatican Necropolis the tourists said they were startled by a shadowy form that emerged briefly from a hidden alcove let out a screech and shielded its eyes from the light before scrambling out of sight. Church sources later stated that the sickly rail-thin figure was likely the former Pope Benedict XVI who has been periodically spotted skulking around the underground tombs over the past two years.“Earlier in the tour I thought I’d heard a faint murmuring noise and something skittering about but I figured it was just my imagination” said tour member Reuben Chapman adding that the group’s guide had assured them it was “nothing” but appeared nervous nonetheless. “As we reached the tomb of St. Peter though I saw these two beady eyes peering out of the darkness from beneath a dirty tattered mitre. Then whatever it was bared its teeth at us and hissed.” “It was horrible—I’ll never forget how weak and terrified that thing looked all hunched-over in the shadows” Chapman continued. “Not to mention its absolutely foul smell.”Members of the tour group described Ratzinger as having a sunken chest hairless body and thin almost translucent skin revealing a vast patchwork of veins underneath. After His Holiness fled the tourists reportedly came across a nest made from filthy scraps of old papal vestments and Apostolic Palace tapestries in the corner of a mausoleum which they said had been heavily soiled. Strewn about nearby were the remnants of a red leather shoe; a small pile of shiny objects including crosses several past pontiffs’ Piscatory Rings gum wrappers and various keys; as well as a number of heavily gnawed-on bones from a smashed reliquary box.When reached for comment Vatican officials confirmed that sightings of a feral Ratzinger lurking in hidden corners of the holy city date back to March 2013 shortly after the inauguration of Pope Francis. Around that time according to reports the Swiss Guard pursued the one-time Vicar of Christ after he was caught trying to steal a crucifix-topped staff and other items of papal regalia belonging to his successor though they were said to have quickly lost his trail when the pale shriveled figure retreated down a narrow drainpipe.The 88-year-old reformist theologian is believed to have kept mainly to the Necropolis since that time though his contorted frame is said to be periodically spotted in the early morning hours hiding in the shadows of the colonnades in St. Peter’s Square where he reportedly hunts for the rats and pigeons upon which he subsists.“Last month Cardinal [Gerhard Ludwig] Müller and Cardinal [Robert] Sarah found the pope emeritus crouching on the baptismal font in the Sistine Chapel lapping up holy water and they had to chase him off with a broom” said Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi who noted that the filth-caked Ratzinger had appeared crazed with thirst raising serious concerns for his health among the curia. “We want to help the poor guy we really do but every time anyone gets close to him he just starts clawing at them with his overgrown fingernails and then scurries down into the crypts.” “We’ve made efforts to bring him in but he’s always one step ahead of us” Lombardi added. “He knows those tunnels better than anyone.”Congregants visiting the basilica have provided additional accounts of the emaciated former pontiff. A woman who was lighting a candle for a deceased relative said she saw a shivering Ratzinger attempting to warm himself by huddling close to votives in the Chapel of St. Helen last February. In addition several altar boys have reportedly seen him in the sacristy devouring communion wafers by the boxful. And just this past Christmas a group of nuns found him clinging beneath a pew during midnight Mass after which he is said to have darted out the bronze doors and quickly scaled a travertine column to the basilica roof.Moreover numerous sources said the secretive figure has proved a costly nuisance to the Holy See noting that nearly every painting and photograph of Francis that had been hung around the Vatican had been found at some point or another with the eyes scratched out.“If we can’t catch him soon and relocate him to a suitable home we may be forced to resort to less humane measures” Lombardi told reporters. “We’re still going to keep setting trays of sweets and highly conservative doctrinal bulletins beside the crypt entrance in hopes of luring him out of there but we haven’t ruled out the possibility of just hiring an exterminator and fumigating the whole place.”

Let us remember though that to merely celebrate Christmas—to exchange gifts and eat our candy canes in peace—without the government or the powerful secular elite coming in and destroying it is a blessing in itself.”“They want to bring an end to our holiest day” he added as several others erected a 3-foot-tall light-up Grinch and plastic signpost bearing the words “Santa Stop Here” behind him. “It is up to us to keep Christmas alive.”After double-checking on the chamber’s entrance hatch to ensure it was tightly closed and locked Greg then reportedly led the gathered Christians in hushed renditions of “God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen” and “A Holly Jolly Christmas” as the shrub was lit.Those in attendance many of whom had trekked hundreds or even thousands of miles spoke of the great sacrifices they had made solely so that they could look upon an actual Christmas tree with their own eyes. A number of the Christians recounted how they had secretly carried a brightly painted plastic nativity scene and an inflatable 7-foot-tall snowman to the secret site the latter item having been trafficked across three states in a truck with a false bottom. Others mentioned how they had sewed a few star- and wreath-shaped sugar cookies into the linings of their coats to avoid detection by the masses who sought to erase their holiday—and ultimately their entire faith—from American life.Reports confirmed that many who had arrived in the hidden underground sanctuary immediately broke down in tears upon being greeted with the forbidden words “Merry Christmas” a phrase none had heard spoken openly in years for fear of harsh reprisals.“It was difficult and dangerous to get here but it’s all worth it to actually be able to celebrate the birth of Jesus” said a 42-year-old teacher from Virginia who refused to give her name as she helped flock the shrub with a spray can of fake snow and arranged gifts of Yankee Candles and Amazon gift cards underneath its meager branches. “Unfortunately this is the only way we can practice our beliefs now that corporations the media and our elected leaders have all conspired to remove every trace of Christmas from the country.”“I just want to make sure my kids know what Christmas is really about” she continued adjusting the plush reindeer antlers atop her head and switching on her glowing Rudolph nose.After the Christmas shrub was lit the Christians were reportedly grateful to partake in other sacred traditions without fear of interference or abuse such as the reading of the 2005 storybook classic The Elf On The Shelf and the viewing of grainy VHS copies of A Charlie Brown Christmas The Santa Clause and other beloved films that had been passed down through the generations.Sources confirmed that as the evening drew to a close all of their wrapping paper Christmas cards and fabric Santa hats were burned in trash cans to erase any evidence of the shunned celebration. The wary Christians then reportedly removed all incriminating green-and-red items from their persons and dispersed in small groups so as not to attract attention from federal authorities.“Make sure your little ones destroy their stockings before you leave and empty their pockets of any trinkets or bells—they mustn’t have anything on them that jingles” one man was overheard saying tearfully to a friend before embracing him and slipping off into the night. “I’ll see you again next December God willing. Stay safe out there.”

Ever since a steady stream of awestruck traders and financial executives have been observed making the trek down Broadway to Bowling Green Park where they can touch the 7000-pound sculpture’s horns and beseech it to grant them a profitable IPO merger or tax inversion.“I came to stand in the presence of this wondrous miracle” said Mark Cadwell manager of the $625 million hedge fund Polestar Overseas humbly placing a sovereign bond prospectus before the weeping bull and calling upon it to raise the credit rating from BBB+ to A-. “My faith in free enterprise had been shaken deeply by the slowing growth in emerging markets and I felt hopeless and lost. But as I submitted myself before this sacred figure my mind opened to the vast possibilities of investing in distressed debt and inverse ETFs and my belief in our economic system was fully restored. In its eternal wisdom I have been reborn.”Added Cadwell “Praise be unto open markets!”According to estimates tens of thousands of financial pilgrims have journeyed to witness the bull’s tears over the past several weeks with some arriving from as far away as the Nikkei exchange in Tokyo. Devout commodity traders securities brokers and portfolio managers have been seen fighting their way through the crowds to prostrate themselves at the sculpture’s hooves. Often they will seek blessings from the lachrymose statue sources said by leaving behind offerings such as incense personal net worth statements or proprietary trading algorithms.Many of the financial professionals who have supplicated themselves before the sculpture told reporters they believe its weeping foretells an era of doom in which tougher bank regulations will require institutions to maintain higher capital reserve ratios. Others however claimed the bull’s tears were a portent of prosperity and good fortune heralding a protracted period of high returns ample arbitrage opportunities or even the imminent overturning of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.Sources said several of the most committed devotees have elected to remain by the statue day and night fasting and flogging themselves with SEC quarterly reports in order to purify themselves for the coming fiscal year. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is reportedly among those who have refused to leave the bull’s side since witnessing the phenomenon with the Fortune 500 CEO growing gaunt and pale as he sits beside the statue softly reciting the latest LIBOR rates while subsisting on a single simple daily meal of sparkling water and salmon crudo.“I came to the bull seeking a revelation about how to sell a new collateralized debt instrument I’ve developed that’s backed by pools of private student loans” said investment banker David Stremski speaking to reporters from an East River pier as he boarded a helicopter to his home in the Hamptons. “At first my thoughts were confused and dark but after two days and two nights of holding vigil and extolling the market’s virtues I know exactly how I can position it as a stable investment-grade asset and generate a quick short-term profit for myself.”“I can’t wait to spread the good news of double-digit annualized yields to all the true-believing partners in my firm” Stremski added.At press time the Institute of International Finance had certified the event as an official financial miracle the first such designation issued since 2008 when the financial services firm AIG extraordinarily arose from the dead.

And when you carried them around they wouldn’t zap you or be too hot to hold or anything even though all the energy would be whirling around inside.”“The cubes wouldn’t hurt people; they would help people” Garcia continued.Additionally many Americans surveyed said that the blue cubes of energy would be incredibly durable and would never break even if they were dropped on the ground or a drink was accidentally spilled on them.But by far the biggest recurrent complaint reportedly stemming from the lack of blue cubes of energy was that further technological advances—namely “even faster” blue cubes of energy—were being held back due to the cubes not yet having been invented.“How are we all supposed to live in space if we don’t have the blue cubes of energy?” said David Reston of Batavia NY later adding that NASA would probably develop its own special “super” blue energy cubes. “We need those cubes for our spaceship boosters to get us around in space. And how are we going to live in our houses up on Mars without those cubes?”“At this rate we’ll never have the red floating spheres that make you live forever” Reston added.
2015-11-04T14:20:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/economists-estimate-human-civilization-still-years-away-1819578413,Economists Estimate Human Civilization Still Years Away From Turning Profit,BALTIMORE—After an exhaustive review of financial records from the present back to the cuneiform ledgers of ancient Mesopotamia economists at Johns Hopkins University released a report Wednesday indicating that human civilization is still many years away from turning a profit.The report confirmed that humanity driven by valuable innovations such as agriculture written language the Gregorian calendar transistors and germ theory has made great progress toward profitability over the past 10000 fiscal years but according to economic experts its overall operating costs will continue to outstrip its revenue for the foreseeable future.“Despite its many scientific artistic and cultural achievements the human race has yet to translate its productivity into solid earnings” said the report’s lead author Linda Holloway noting that while humankind’s investment in technologies like movable type and the assembly line have led to increased efficiency it has often been hamstrung by poor strategic decisions including poor allocation of resources and chronic underinvestment in training new members. “The domestication of animals and the discovery of electricity have propped up humanity for a long time. If it wants to see a return on its investment though it will need to have several hundred strong quarters going forward.”“Overall human civilization’s financial outlook has certainly brightened since the Neolithic period” she continued. “But there have been major setbacks along the way such as the significant decline in output during the Black Death.”Similarly famines occasional ethnic cleansing and a number of world wars have repeatedly cut into the labor supply disrupting markets and continually forcing financial analysts to push back their projections for the species.By the end of the Iron Age Holloway observed advances in toolmaking and the birth of classical philosophy had led to several promising fiscal centuries spurring hopes that civilization could become a profitable enterprise sooner than expected. However management turmoil during the fall of the Roman Empire is said to have stifled ingenuity and led to an extended period of reorganization that prevented necessary investment in crucial emerging areas such as infrastructure and international trade.“In many ways humanity still hasn’t recovered from the collapse of colonialism when it was poised to become very profitable indeed” said Holloway explaining that mankind “made a killing” through the mid-20th century but that its exploitation of new assets proved unsustainable. “The abolition of slavery and indentured servitude have also severely hampered profitability causing labor costs to spiral out of control and pushing off the financial break-even point for humanity by at least a millennium. Whatever the case human beings need to boost earnings somewhere if they’re ever going to get out of the red.”“Thankfully they do have the new iPhone rollout on the horizon next year so that should be a pretty big boost for them” she added.
2015-11-03T13:55:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/executive-recalls-booming-private-prison-corporation-s-1819578395,Executive Recalls Booming Private Prison Corporation’s Humble Beginnings As Modest 6-Cell Facility,PHOENIX—Speaking to reporters Tuesday from his spacious corner office in the company’s sleek downtown corporate headquarters Harbor Corrections Group CEO Walter G. Parks reminisced fondly about the business’s humble beginnings as a modest six-cell prison.Parks recalled how he founded HCG in 1986 back when “[he] was just a kid” in his words with a single government contract and only a handful of convicts to his company’s name pausing often to share colorful asides about his business’s early struggles. The executive then marveled at how his small independent operation had since grown into a $3 billion detention-services firm with offerings that expand beyond criminal incarceration to encompass the confinement of juvenile offenders the mentally ill and migrants awaiting deportation.“I’d say we’ve come a long way since those crazy early days” said Parks chuckling at the thought of the multiple loans he took out to finance the initial 1300-square-foot facility and the long hours he put in trying to get the company’s name out to various states’ departments of corrections. “When we opened for business all we had was two or three part-time guards for the whole place—that’s it. We didn’t even have a watchtower at first just a guy on the roof who sat in a folding chair with a rifle on his lap. Hard to believe but that’s how we got our start.”“If you’d told me back then—back when we had only one basketball hoop in the yard and barely enough money to keep the surveillance cameras on—that one day we’d have 80000 beds at 60 facilities in 22 states I’d have called you nuts” he continued.According to Parks it was “all hands on deck” the first few years and for a time he handled the intake of each prisoner personally filling out all the necessary forms and overseeing the filing system and even stepping in on occasion to act as the facility’s cook to provide the inmates with their three square meals a day. In those days he said the cell HCG used for solitary confinement doubled as its office supply closet. Now his employees work in more roomy environs with the company’s 40-person in-house lobbying division occupying an entire floor of a modern office complex.Parks confirmed that for much of its first decade in business the company might go weeks or even months without securing a no-bid contract to ship in prisoners from out of state. But in 1995 after a handful of well-placed campaign contributions and a concerted effort to help pass tough “three strikes” sentencing laws in state legislatures HCG was reportedly able to break ground on its first of many full-size maximum-security prisons.“There were times early on when I’d walk down the hall pass only three or four inmates and think ‘How are we going to make it to the end of the month?’” said Parks recalling several periods in which the company “hemorrhaged money” due to low recidivism the result of occasional public investment in criminal rehabilitation programs. “Compare that to now though when all of our prisons are filled to the gills and we’re housing the overflow on bunks in the gymnasiums.”“And what’s more we’re hiring them all out as manual labor at pennies on the dollar” he added. “Talk about a success story.”Parks confided that in the days before mandatory minimum sentences became widespread the only thing that kept HCG in business was the occasional prison riot which resulted in more time being added to inmates’ sentences helping to ensure more of the company’s cells stayed occupied and bolstering its revenue.Nowadays he explained his business is so successful that it can pick and choose whom it imprisons turning away difficult criminals who are more costly to house.“Sure it was touch and go for a while” said Parks admitting he used to second-guess whether it would ever be possible “to break even at this game.” “But that just makes it all the sweeter now that we’ve come out the other side and can now call ourselves an industry leader.”“At this rate we’re going to have 40 additional facilities in the United States by 2025” he added. “And we’ve got plans for more on the way.”

Following Resignation Of Caretaker,WASHINGTON—According to law enforcement personnel and dozens of distraught eyewitnesses packs of savage ferocious House Republicans are currently running loose through the nation’s capital causing mayhem and bloodshed on a mass scale following the departure of their longtime caretaker John Boehner.The crazed and vicious GOP representatives who are said to be howling wildly and wearing the tattered remains of business attire reportedly worked themselves into a frenzy after Boehner failed to attend to them earlier today and subsequently broke free from the House chamber. Sources confirmed that the elected officials have since carved a trail of chaos and destruction through the city attacking civilians along the National Mall running amok through Metro tunnels overturning cars and storming numerous federal office buildings.Hundreds are believed dead.“At this time we can confirm that we have captured Representatives Steve King Mark Meadows and Don Young but the other 243 escaped congressmen remain at large and should be considered extremely dangerous” said D.C. police chief Cathy Lanier amid piles of wreckage and large pools of blood in the Capitol rotunda explaining that the carnage began on the House floor when an agitated member of the Freedom Caucus picked up an American flag stand and drove it through the heart of Rep. Dave Reichert (R-WA) who had voted earlier this week in favor of a compromise budget deal. “We understand the pandemonium erupted immediately after the caretaker’s resignation became effective causing the horde of frenzied representatives to rip the House chamber’s door off its hinges and pour down the Capitol steps and out into the city.”“I cannot emphasize enough that without vigilant caretaking these representatives can become unstable and violent at a moment’s notice” she continued. “Until authorities are able to safely tranquilize and net them we recommend all residents seek shelter indoors.”Because Boehner was reportedly all that maintained order among the wild bands of House Republicans Beltway insiders said his absence all but ensured that anarchy derangement and fervent bloodlust would reign over the legislative body’s majority caucus. Indeed shortly after the lawmakers convened this morning a visibly raving Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy allegedly began jumping up and down on the rostrum riling up his GOP colleagues while House Sergeant at Arms Paul D. Irving unable to gain a handle on the situation was said to have been trampled to death when members decided to bolt for the exits.Onlookers confirmed traffic has been completely stalled on K Street by an ongoing confrontation between a potentially rabid Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-SC) and a blood-spattered Rep. Bill Flores (R-TX) both of whom have spent the past several hours bearing their teeth snarling and wildly charging at each other in a brutal attempt to establish dominance.Additionally widespread blackouts in the D.C. area were reported after a manic Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC) gnawed through a power line and electrocuted herself.“It’s absolutely terrifying; I saw Representative Jeb Hensarling wandering down the middle of Constitution Avenue dragging a lifeless congressional page behind him” said D.C. resident Harold Peters who added that he nearly took pity on a bruised visibly shell-shocked and completely naked Rep. Justin Amash (R-MI) he had seen muttering to himself and rocking back and forth in the fetal position beside a bonfire of historical documents outside the National Archives. “And I don’t think I’ll ever be able to erase from my mind the horrible screams that [Treasury Secretary] Jacob Lew made when he got cornered by the Oversight and Government Reform Committee behind the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. By the time [Rep.] Jason Chaffetz started throwing him around like a rag doll there was nothing we could do.”“Those poor moderates in their pack didn’t stand a chance either” he added noting the recent discovery of various severed body parts belonging to Reps. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) Peter King (R-NY) and Charlie Dent (R-PA) floating in the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool.Many D.C. residents said they are too frightened to leave their homes citing in particular a delirious Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR) who was said to have hissed at passersby as he shredded pages of gun control legislation in Dupont Circle and the failed attempts by local police to use a signed authorization for the Keystone XL pipeline to coax a torch-wielding Policy Committee Chairman Luke Messer (R-IN) down from the roof of the Energy Department building where he continues to hold several hostages his hair matted in dirt and excrement.Furthermore eyewitness accounts indicate a berserk Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) has spent the past 20 minutes repeatedly running at full speed into the locked entrance of Planned Parenthood’s D.C. headquarters apparently attempting to break down its doors.“Our law enforcement professionals will restore order to our streets and neighborhoods as soon as possible but clearly our city needs to have a plan in place to ensure this never happens again” Washington mayor Muriel Bowser told reporters at a hastily convened press conference at her executive office the sounds of civilians shrieking National Guard helicopters and occasional gunfire audible behind her. “As much as I’d like to believe the next caretaker of the House will be able to hold things together it’s entirely possible they’ll rip him to shreds within just a few months’ time and we’ll be right back where we are now.”She added: “Let’s be honest. That guy has no chance.”
2015-10-27T11:50:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/fbi-counterterrorism-agent-wistfully-recalls-watching-2-1819578372,FBI Counterterrorism Agent Wistfully Recalls Watching 20-Year-Old Muslim-American Grow Up,HOUGHTON MI—Saying he could hardly believe how much the young man had changed over the past eight years a visibly sentimental FBI counterterrorism agent fondly recalled Tuesday watching 20-year-old Muslim-American Omar Haddad grow up.While speaking with reporters Special Agent David Tierney repeatedly paused to marvel at how quickly the time had slipped by striking a bittersweet tone as he described what it had been like to see the young Muslim boy mature and come into his own as he studied for his classes made friends played on the school baseball team and prayed at his local mosque every Friday.“Sometimes it feels like it was just yesterday that I was watching little 12-year-old Omar get on the bus and head off to seventh grade but I guess time really flies” said the FBI agent expressing amazement at how a middle-schooler who had seemed so shy when talking to girls on the phone could become so confident and self-assured in his conversations as an adult. “God I remember seeing him on his first date just this scrawny teenager at a 7 p.m. showing of Captain America trying to work up the courage to put his arm around a girl. Look at him now—handsome popular and getting straights A’s in his junior year at Michigan Tech.”“And to think we’ve been right there with him every step of the way” Tierney added.As he looked through an immense collection of photos and videos from the boy’s youth the agent reported that watching Haddad grow up had been stressful at times particularly during a brief period in 2011 when it appeared the young man was falling in with a bad crowd. But just a year or two later he said Haddad’s priorities had changed significantly and Tierney was soon traveling around the country as the boy toured prospective colleges.“I’ll never forget how nervous he was on his first day of high school—so were we of course” said Tierney recalling in detail the apprehension on Haddad’s face and the brand-new Jansport backpack slung over his shoulder as he walked into school that day. “But his teenage years went pretty smoothly all things considered. Sure sometimes he would stay out a little late which would cause us to worry but he never went anywhere he wasn’t supposed to. Omar was the kind of kid who would always finish his homework before he would hang out with friends or goof around online.”“I suppose he would’ve been pretty mad if he’d found out we were reading his texts and snooping around his favorite websites” he continued. “But you need to know what they’re getting up to especially at that age. It’s just your job.”After letting out a sigh and asking himself where the time had gone Tierney confirmed he would continue to keep an eye on the young man as he made his way in the adult world. The 13-year veteran of the FBI’s counterterrorism division added that whatever Haddad chose to do with his life he was sure it would be a success.“I just wish I could say as much for his younger brother” Tierney said. “We’re definitely going to have to get a lot more involved with that kid.”

To move between departments—as far as a mile between IT and Weeknight Meal Ideas—the company has reportedly provided several hundred rechargeable electric scooters while a fleet of Wi-Fi-equipped Bisquick vans is said to be available 24 hours a day to shuttle workers between the complex and their homes in San Francisco Berkeley San Jose and other surrounding cities.“It’s well known that Bisquick expects a lot from its employees but in return we’ve strived to give them the benefits to match.” Reinert said the values Bisquick sought to embody in the design of the campus are the same that drive the company itself: simplicity freshness quality and fun. To that end Bisquick added many communal facilities including a full-size saltwater swimming pool 10 onsite pancake bars stocked with organic fruits and various flavors of syrup a Japanese zen garden hand-constructed in Kyoto and reassembled on campus and a weekly lecture series at the grounds’ 2000-seat amphitheater featuring speakers such as futurist Michio Kaku fiction writer Stephenie Meyer and former British prime minister Tony Blair.Additionally located in a black cube-shaped building in the northwest corner of the campus is Futurequick Bisquick’s secretive advanced R&D group accessible only to a select few employees with the highest security clearance which is purportedly responsible for trailblazing technological feats like the company’s premade Shake ’N Pour pancakes and the ice cream wafflewich.“It’s well known that Bisquick expects a lot from its employees but in return we’ve strived to give them the benefits to match” said Reinert highlighting the company’s free onsite daycare and hot yoga classes. “Our workers are unquestionably the best and this environment is meant to empower them to build their own agendas. In fact we encourage every hire to set aside 20 percent of their time for quick-bake passion projects.”“Our Bisquick Bakery Refrigerated Dough product was actually dreamed up by an employee in Finance during his Free-Focus Time” she added. “That’s a perfect example of the kind of brilliant minds we have here at Bisquick.”While many in the area have hailed the arrival of Bisquick some longtime residents—wary of higher rents and the company’s famously insular corporate culture—have expressed skepticism.“Bisquick is just another one of these Silicon Valley behemoths that moves in and totally changes the community—and not for the better” said local resident Peter Watson who noted that the land used for Bisquick’s indoor rock climbing wall used to be open park space that the city sold to help attract the company. “When I moved here in the ’80s it was all students and families; now my whole street is nothing but Bisquick millionaires in their electric cars and luxury penthouses.”“My neighbors and I have complained to the city council but with Bisquick’s deep pockets there really isn’t anything we can do” Watson added. “I guess we just have to put up with it and hope that sooner or later this pancake bubble bursts.”

Wandering out the Oval Office’s east door toward where it stood grazing in the dew-covered grass he found himself frozen in place as the wild horse lifted its head and briefly returned his gaze.“Oh my” whispered a breathless Obama who stepped forward into the night just in time to see the flash of a brilliant white tail disappearing into the swirling fog. “Wait—come back!”According to reports the 44th president of the United States gazed longingly into the distance before heading off in pursuit of the stallion stumbling barefoot through a maze of magnolia trees and into an overgrown oak grove guided only by the full moon and an occasional ghostly whinnying up ahead. Every time he caught sight of the pale figure it would reportedly disappear further into the shadow-drenched recesses of the garden eventually cantering off through a thicket of brambles and onto the South Lawn.Reports indicate that Obama had completely lost track of just where on the White House grounds he was or how long he had been following the animal when he pulled back a thick curtain of vines to find the stallion standing in a small clearing drinking from a spring.“What is this place?” he asked in a low voice as he took in the lush unfamiliar greenery that surrounded him the horse having led him far deeper into the Rose Garden than he had ever ventured before. “Why did you bring me here?”“My goodness you really are beautiful” the nation’s president added as the fog that had enveloped his journey began to clear.Taking in the entirety of the creature for the first time Obama is said to have slowly approached the animal and paused to appreciate its gentle strength and impressive size completely mesmerized by the horse’s grace and poise. The president then slowly lifted his hand to stroke the stallion’s shimmering mane running his fingers through its silky strands.“Shhh” said Obama who was reportedly taken aback by the animal’s eyes dark orbs that seemed to look directly into the president’s soul. “It’s almost as if I know you from somewhere.”“Perhaps I saw you in a dream—could it be I’m dreaming now?” he continued staring into the creature’s calm gleaming eyes. “But you feel so real!”At that moment sources said the stallion simply turned and trotted back toward the woods leaving the president alone with his thoughts as the first lights of dawn appeared in the sky.Its full majestic form silhouetted by the setting moon as it reared back onto its hind legs reports confirmed that the horse let out a whinny of farewell mere seconds before it was shot down in a hail of gunfire by Secret Service snipers.
2015-10-15T10:08:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/study-finds-carving-names-into-public-property-prolongs-1819578330,Study Finds Carving Names Into Public Property Prolongs Relationship By 30 Or More Years,MINNEAPOLIS—According to a study published Thursday in the Journal Of Marriage And Family that assessed factors contributing to lasting and happy relationships the practice of carving names into public property prolongs the time a couple is together by 30 years or more. Controlling for race age gender and income researchers found that partners who had carved their names into park benches outdoor art installations city landmarks and other structures intended for the enjoyment of the general population remained together an average of three decades longer than couples who did not engrave their names into such property.“While numerous factors play a part in a relationship’s longevity—compatibility of personalities empathy and respect among others—only one criterion all but guaranteed a healthy union that lasted for multiple decades and that was the use of a knife or other sharp object to carve the pair’s names into wood concrete or glass at a public location” said lead researcher Jans Kingman who later noted the estimated 9 million happily married couples in the United States whose names are carved into desks at libraries. “We found that these couples not only experience higher levels of sexual satisfaction and intimacy they also demonstrate an intense devotion to one another and a deep mutual understanding that were not observed in couples whose names were never inscribed into property designated for public use.”“According to our research no one who has carved their names into public property has ever once been cheated on” he added. “These couples stay dedicated to each other no matter what.”As part of their research Kingman’s team reportedly conducted a nationwide survey of couples who had been together for 40 years or more finding that 95 percent of respondents had indelibly marked their names into public spaces in large capital letters. Additionally the survey found that those partners who had surrounded their names with a large outline of a heart or had included the words “Luv” or “4ever” described even higher levels of mutual contentment with these subjects unanimously reporting an intense attraction to their partner that had not wavered since the moment they completed their etching.However in romantic relationships where couples had not used a Swiss Army knife their car keys or an old pen to scrape their names into rocks along public park trails or into the window of a city bus or subway car levels of dissatisfaction and ultimately dissolutions of partnerships rose dramatically.“If a couple carves their names into a location of significant cultural or religious value such as an ancient ruin or a site on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places our data show that they will be together even longer and have an even deeper emotional and physical connection” said Kingman explaining that every couple they studied who had carved their names into some portion of a World Heritage Site had died simultaneously in each other’s arms in their 90s after a lifetime of marital bliss. “We found that this phenomenon also applies to the size and visibility of the names themselves. Bigger deeper and darker carvings featuring full names are shown to prolong relationships upwards of 50 years longer than the national average while tinier etchings that are composed of just initials and a ‘plus’ sign extend a relationship by only a decade and a half.”“The more visible and structurally damaging to the piece of property the greater the positive effect the carving will have on one’s relationship” he continued. According to Kingman couples who were experiencing rough patches in their relationships were able to rid themselves of all of their interpersonal problems simply by eluding security at a place of public importance and marking the site permanently with a carving consisting of their names and anniversary date.However researchers emphasized that couples only receive the positive relationship benefits if their carvings are permanent noting that those who simply drew their names in the sand at the beach or wrote their names on a door frame in pencil actually experienced 10 fewer months in a happy committed relationship than the average couple. “I’ll never forget the moment I knew my husband and I would be together forever: We were at Navajo Point at the Grand Canyon and when no one was looking Larry pulled out his pocket knife and scratched our names right into the wall of the Desert View Watchtower” Cincinnati resident Beverly Hanley 67 said of her marriage of 44 years. “When I looked at that big heart with ‘LARRY & BEV-BEV’ in the middle and an arrow through it and I saw it way up high in the center of a beam where everyone would notice it I knew our love was eternal.”“Some people say that love fades with time” Hanley continued “but the romance and the burning passion between Larry and me is just the same now as it was that very day. Maybe even stronger.”Researchers added that their findings represent the most significant discovery in the field of social relations since a 2009 study that confirmed fraternity brothers who painted a big rock with their organization’s Greek letters formed unbreakable bonds and were always there for one another in times of need for the rest of their lives.

And I always speak at a steady even pace—too fast and I might trip over a word too slow and they might think I’m struggling to come up with the right words.”“I have to be on top of my game every single day because if I start slipping up it’s only a matter of time before they put me in a home” said Powell who explained that she keeps her calendar by her side whenever she speaks on the phone with family members so she can recall without hesitation the date and time of any upcoming appointment social event or anniversary when it’s brought up. “I make sure I place my keys in the exact same spot 100 percent of the time. And I always speak at a steady even pace—too fast and I might trip over a word too slow and they might think I’m struggling to come up with the right words.”“Next week I’m helping with my grandson Bradley’s ninth birthday and I know that if I mess up one detail if I get the wrong kind of frosting or forget the streamers I’m as good as gone” she added.The catalyst for Powell’s concerns was reportedly an incident last Christmas in which she mistook her son’s cell phone for her own accidentally dialing a number from it. While chastising herself for the small oversight she noticed her son whispering something to her youngest daughter in the hallway and immediately wondered if they were discussing whether her blunder was a symptom of Alzheimer’s.Ever since Powell said she has altered her behavior to avoid any situation that puts her at risk of appearing confused or forgetful including cleaning up the slightest signs of clutter carefully familiarizing herself with the settings on her newly purchased microwave and double-checking to make sure she hasn’t left even one unpaid bill sitting on her kitchen counter.“I manage well enough during calls with the kids but Thanksgiving’s coming up and I’m going to have to be on my toes for four straight days with everyone around” said Powell who confirmed that out of increasing fear that the error would be “the one that does [her] in” she would be setting multiple timers so she could be absolutely certain she does not burn the turkey. “If I so much as call my grandson by his father’s name in a moment of absentmindedness there goes my independence. And if I don’t happen to hear everything that one of my kids says to me there’s no way I’m asking them to repeat it—I’ll just be sticking to a general response of ‘That’s nice’ making sure I maintain eye contact and deliver those words with confidence.”“Maybe I should leave some finished crossword puzzles lying around for people to find just in case” she continued.Powell went on to state that she must be neatly dressed and perfectly groomed at all times as any slight inattention to personal care could arouse suspicions of a deteriorating mind. She also noted that after rolling her ankle last week she avoided contact with her family for several days fearing they would take her accident as proof that a cognitive impairment was causing her to lose her sense of balance and that she was in danger of taking a more serious fall at any moment.“I’ve stopped driving with my kids because I know a single wrong turn might get them talking about whether it’s time to take my license away” Powell said. “The last time I went shopping with my daughters I missed the exit to the mall and I swear I saw Rebecca raise an eyebrow and exchange glances with Allison. I must be on pretty thin ice already and one more slip-up could get me carted off to assisted-living.”“Regardless though it’s good for me to keep up these habits” she added. “That way when I actually start losing my senses I’ll already be really good at covering up for it.”
2015-10-08T13:23:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/nasa-hoping-to-get-in-on-some-defense-funding-with-plan-1819578304,NASA Hoping To Get In On Some Defense Funding With Plan For Torpedo-Equipped Orbital Telescope,WASHINGTON—Discussing plans for a new space-exploration project that it said could also potentially be the most advanced weapon system in the U.S. military’s arsenal NASA confirmed Thursday it was trying to get in on some of the nation’s defense spending by designing a torpedo-equipped orbital telescope.Agency officials told reporters they hope the state-of-the-art space observatory which would allow astronomers to study the furthest reaches of the observable universe and would also hold a payload of 16 torpedoes catches the attention of the Defense Department and ultimately scores them a sweet piece of the military’s $610 billion annual budget.“This satellite has the ability to detect cosmic radiation from 13.5 billion years ago greatly furthering our knowledge of how galaxies first formed after the Big Bang and we installed some torpedo launchers on the side there as well” said NASA senior project scientist Diane Everett adding that the 21-ton telescope which would allow scientists to study the formation of planetary systems capable of supporting life could likely be outfitted with a few other types of weapons too depending on what the military is looking for. “This would be an incredible scientific tool for learning about our universe’s origins. And once the Joint Chiefs get a look at the firepower on this thing maybe they’ll give us a little taste of that 12-figure funding.”With $30 billion NASA could equip the next Mars rover with front-axle-mounted flamethrowers a land-mine detector and a “gigantic” mortar embedded into its frame that could blast targets many miles away.“After all it should be able to shoot things out of orbit and it could probably even hit a bunch of targets on the ground too” Everett continued. “Who knows? They may want two or three of these things.”Officials at NASA whose share of the federal budget has decreased steadily over the past two decades reportedly began discussing the idea of outfitting their next-generation orbital telescope with heavy weaponry such as machine guns and grenade launchers after looking over government records and discovering the space agency’s funding amounts to less than 3 percent of that received by the military. The scientists ultimately decided the best way to get some DoD green was to attach “a whole bunch of torpedos” according to accounts.Moreover NASA sources stated several times that they’re completely open to placing penetrating or fragmentation warheads atop the torpedoes should that increase their chances of dipping their hands into the defense-spending honeypot.“We want to emphasize that the prototype is very flexible and with proper financial support we could probably mount big cannons or something on each end of the near-infrared spectroscope—whatever they want really” said Everett who estimated the massive sunshield required to keep the delicate scientific instruments operating in a thermally stable environment could probably fit “one of those big guns on a tank.” “As long as we get a piece of the Pentagon’s funding action we can work with them to build a telescope that has laser targeting heat-seaking missiles or anything else in addition to expanding our knowledge of the cosmos in ways we cannot yet imagine.”Although this is the first weaponized research platform designed by NASA Everett stressed that the cooperation does not need to end with this project. She estimated that with $30 billion her agency could equip the next Mars rover with front-axle-mounted flamethrowers a land-mine detector and a “gigantic” mortar embedded into its frame that could blast targets many miles away.“This could be the beginning of a bold new frontier for NASA and for the military” said Everett who reportedly pressed her design team to devise ways to attach additional torpedos to the telescope after learning that many of the 2016 Republican presidential candidates’ budget proposals call for further increases in defense spending. “We only need the telescope for about 10 years so we could even strap a thermonuclear device on board and once its mission is complete we could just make it fall back down to earth wherever they like.” “We’re more than happy to do it really” she added. “If anyone in the Pentagon’s budgeting department is interested really just give us a call.”
2015-10-07T10:46:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/biologists-still-no-closer-to-discovering-how-birds-hav-1819578301,Biologists Still No Closer To Discovering How Birds Have Sex,BERKELEY CA—With not a single scientist having successfully observed the behavior despite extensive ongoing research the field of biology has made no progress in its understanding of how birds have sex experts at the University of California told reporters Wednesday.Through 2500 years of recorded natural history hundreds of thousands of hours of fieldwork and the testing of innumerable hypotheses in regard to the mechanism by which avifauna reproduce not one instance of bird sex has been reliably documented photographed or described according to the biologists.“We’ve spent considerable time and effort attempting to unravel the mystery of sex among bird populations but unfortunately it remains one of the great unanswered questions in our field” said ornithologist Daniel Abramson who added that he has studied hundreds of bird species in habitats all across the globe spending the bulk of his 28-year career staring through binoculars and crouched behind blinds in fruitless attempts to catch them in the act. “We can say for certain that eggs emerge from some part of a bird’s anatomy and we know baby birds hatch from those eggs. But beyond that we honestly have no idea how it works.”“We haven’t ruled out the possibility that the feathers may in fact be the genitals.”“Do they secrete something onto each other’s feathers and absorb it through their skin?” he continued. “Do they fly very high and have sex so far up in the sky that we’re unable to observe it? At this point no one can say for sure.”Abramson’s colleagues echoed his frustration and enumerated the vast array of theories currently being considered. These include the idea that male birds may be fertilizing the eggs in some way after they’ve been laid as well as the hypothesis that all birds are females that produce clones of themselves. While unable to elaborate any further the biologists also put forth the possibility that flying in a V formation or perhaps “that thing on turkeys’ necks” has something to do with the process.A number of experts also reportedly subscribe to the notion that birds are one gender of an entire class of organisms and bats are the other complementary gender.“Most bird observations occur during the day but it’s possible that birds are having sex in the middle of the night when it’s very dark and they’re hard to see or maybe inside clouds where we can’t glimpse them at all—or maybe it occurs both in clouds and at night” said animal physiologist James Bosley a proponent of the theory that currently has the most traction among biologists which suggests that most birds reproduce by flying directly into each other at high speeds. “My own research team is currently looking into whether ducks are doing it under water each time they dip beneath the surface out of our view.”“Before that we looked very carefully at birds that get close to each other and start flapping their wings around a bunch but it turns out that in those instances they’re usually just pecking at the same piece of food” he added.Bosley went on to state that for years scientists had assumed migratory birds only engaged in sexual intercourse after flying south for the winter a theory that was later abandoned after a group of North American ornithologists traveled to a conference at the University of São Paulo and met Brazilian colleagues who had long believed the exact opposite to be true.“At this point we’re not even sure if birds have genitals” said Felicia Lopez a comparative anatomist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “We’ve searched all over their bodies but there are a lot of feathers down where you would expect something to be and it makes it pretty hard to see anything. To be honest though it doesn’t look like there’s much there at all—just look at how smooth they are. It’s hard to picture where a penis would even go.”“We haven’t ruled out the possibility that the feathers may in fact be the genitals” she continued.Nevertheless Lopez remarked biologists remain hopeful believing that more advanced methodologies will allow them to make the first-ever direct observation of bird sex sooner rather than later.“It’s only a matter of time before we’re peering through the brush and finally catch sight of birds in the act of copulation” she said. “As we speak several of my colleagues are out in the field dressed up like birds and strutting seductively around the animals’ natural habitats in attempts to finally witness bird sex firsthand.”

Dylan will be a teenager soon and he needs to start growing up.”“He’s just getting too old for it you know?” she continued. “This is kids’ stuff and he has to learn to let go of it.”“We were going to tell him the truth last year but the thought of him finding out that everything he believed was all made-up was just too heartbreaking.”Admitting she and the rest of her family indulged the belief throughout Dylan’s early childhood Rivers told reporters how they would play along with him and even encourage his belief by making up extravagant stories about his father that instilled a sense of wonder in her son. However she noted they have long since stopped trying to keep up the charade hoping he would notice the implausibilities of the stories he was told and naturally grow out of his youthful fixation on his dad.“When Dylan was 5 or 6 years old and would ask me questions about his father I’d always pretend that I believed in him too” said Rivers explaining that she had initially wanted to maintain her son’s innocence on the subject for as long as possible. “That’s just what you do when they’re little. You see the pure joy that it brings them and of course you don’t want to take that away.”According to Rivers the family keeps waiting for Dylan to catch on but the persistence of his naïveté has forced them to begin thinking about how they might break the news to him as gently as possible. As time goes on Rivers confided it’s getting more and more difficult to imagine having such a talk with her son.“We were going to tell him the truth last year but the thought of him finding out that everything he believed was all made-up was just too heartbreaking” said Rivers recalling how much Dylan’s older sister had cried when she found out at age 9 and how they had encouraged her to keep pretending a while for her brother’s sake. “He still gets so excited when he talks about his dad. There’s really no good way to cushion the blow.”“At the same time the longer we wait to tell him the harder it’s going to be for him to accept the truth” Rivers continued. “I just hope he doesn’t hear it first from the kids at school and then resent us for it.”
2015-10-05T10:22:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/our-town-cast-party-going-off-the-rails-1819578265,‘Our Town’ Cast Party Going Off The Rails,PEEKSKILL NY—Describing a wild scene in which performers and stagehands were loudly conversing laughing and occasionally breaking back into their characters from the play sources confirmed Sunday night that the cast party for the local production of Our Town is currently going off the rails.Members of the Peekskill Players who just concluded a four-show run of the play at the Old Mill Theater downtown told reporters the festivities at the home of assistant director Rachel Mullen have only grown more out of control as the night has progressed spurred on by a 12-pack of craft beer and a bottle of Yellow Tail Shiraz purchased for “the best Webbs and Gibbses the world has ever seen!”“At first we were just talking about our favorite moments from the show and it was pretty subdued but since about 8:30 when the kids who played Rebecca and Wally left with their parents things have really gotten nuts” said Jeffery Morse 54 still wearing his stage makeup from the production in which he portrayed Constable Warren Grover’s Corners’ friendly sheriff. “Everyone’s still pretty hyped up from the matinee. Rachel turned up the Chicago soundtrack the guys from the lighting crew cracked open a bottle of Seagram’s and Grace even got up on the coffee table and belted out her solo from [the spring 2013 production of] Carousel.”“This is definitely the wildest cast party I can remember” Morse added. “At this rate I might end up having to call my wife to pick me up.”After digging into the sheet cake Mullen’s husband purchased at Wegmans and had decorated with the words “Bravo Peekskill Players” the 22 members of the group in attendance reportedly began signing each other’s programs which produced a series of risqué drawings on the cast’s headshots. Sources said things got “really rip-roaring” after wardrobe master David Kelley wrote “I have a nice rack” in a speech bubble by Emma Cochran’s photo a reference to a time she offered to bring in a clothing rack from home for his use.According to reports the rowdiness reached a whole new level when Mullen suggested they all go down to the basement and watch the video of last season’s performance of Brigadoon inspiring Leslie Tobin to start a game in which everyone had to take a drink each time Dan Rankin flubbed his Scottish accent.Meanwhile 57-year-old Peekskill Players veteran and H&R Block associate Carla Withrow reportedly emerged from the bathroom wearing a bald cap from A Christmas Carol and had begun impersonating Our Town director Richard Burdick.“Okay the soda shop scene is working perfectly fine so let’s just go ahead and run it 20 more fucking times before we call it a night” said Withrow pursing her lips and stroking her chin in what those present agreed was a “dead-on” impression. “Oh and maybe we should just completely change all of the third-act blocking the day before dress rehearsal. Is everyone okay with that?”With the party barreling on well past 11 p.m. Brian Holder was reportedly overheard saying that he “might still remember the choreo from Sweeney” and several tipsy members of the cast were seen attempting to recreate a dance routine they learned for a production of Sweeney Todd a few years back. According to partygoers the soirée was so far out of hand by that point that Mullen’s husband came downstairs in his robe to remind everyone he had an early morning tomorrow.In addition multiple guests at the party told reporters that come to think of it they hadn’t seen set designer Margaret Dotson or audio tech Joe Navarro since the two went out to the porch with a bottle of mescal an hour or so earlier.“You guys this has honestly been one of the best shows the Peekskill Players have ever done” said house manager Kate Anderson struggling to hold back tears as she addressed fourth-grade teacher Josh Verdin and local radio personality Anthony Fiore both of whom were still wearing the fake beards from their Our Town costumes. “Like everyone absolutely killed it. Even after all that bullshit with the cemetery scene we completely nailed it.”“Oh my God it’s gonna be so weird not seeing you guys every Sunday and Thursday” Anderson continued. “I don’t know what I’m gonna do until Guys And Dolls auditions.”At press time sources confirmed that a third button on Carla Withrow’s prairie dress had been unfastened and she was beckoning anyone she could to dance with her in the center of the living room.
2015-10-01T11:45:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/archaeologists-reconstruct-snyder-s-of-hanover-pretzel-1819578303,Archaeologists Reconstruct Snyder’s Of Hanover Pretzel From Pieces Discovered In Des Moines–Area Stop ’N Go,DES MOINES IA—Heralding the discovery as the most complete specimen of its kind a team of archaeologists from the University of Iowa announced Thursday that they had managed to reconstruct more than 75 percent of a Snyder’s of Hanover pretzel from fragments found at a Des Moines–area Stop ’N Go.According to researchers the pretzel—the remains of which were discovered scattered across three spaces in the store’s parking lot with secondary sites found just inside the automatic doors and underneath the hot dog roller grill—has required thousands of man-hours to painstakingly collect and categorize and is the most thorough reconstruction of a baked snack to date.“We knew we had something special when we found the largely intact section of the pretzel’s upper-left arc but it wasn’t until we arranged it alongside several smaller fragments that we realized just how significant this find was” said lead researcher Dr. Brian Michener describing the process by which his team methodically mapped and staked off the nearly 30-square-foot expanse of asphalt across which most of the snack’s remains were spread. “Of course it’s important to understand that there is a lot we still don’t know. Had this pretzel ever been slathered in some kind of processed cheese sauce? Was it a stand-alone snack or part of some kind of party mix?”“It’s really an incredible find—the biggest discovery of its kind since a fully intact Goldfish cracker was found stuck in the treads of a Wawa floor mat in 2006.”“These are the kinds of questions we hope to answer in the months and years to come” he added.Michener explained that after larger debris such as Yoo-hoo caps and empty 24-oz. Monster Energy drink cans were cleared from the worksite great care was taken to brush away layers of cigarette ash and Dorito dust from the pretzel fragments without causing damage to their golden-brown crust. The remains of the snack were reportedly further covered in a hardened mixture of powdered sugar from Hostess Donettes jerky grease and other sediments that naturally occur in environments such as the one where the pretzel was discovered and had to be thoroughly cleaned before further study. Researchers said each remnant was then photographed labeled and treated with acrylic polymers to prevent further corrosion of the snack’s extremely delicate and crunchy remains. Magnified images of the pretzel’s surface reportedly showed hundreds of small pockmarks revealing that salt at one time covered its exterior which led team members to speculate that the snack may have possessed a savoriness of greater magnitude than a Cheddar Cheese Pringle.“The pretzel’s larger size clearly sets it apart from the smaller or ‘mini’ variety which are generally found in groups” said Dr. Bethany Folta who worked on the laboratory team that was tasked with classifying the discovery within the broader pretzel taxonomic category. “At the same time it’s not nearly as mammoth as members of the fresh-baked soft pretzel family while the absence of a honey-mustard coating was enough for us to rule out all known subtypes of Rold Gold and Gardetto’s pretzels. Only after laboratory testing of its gluten content were we able to determine that it was a Snyder’s and not its close cousin the Utz Sourdough Special.”Folta said that archaeologists had to take precautions to ensure they were not led astray by the remnants of other snacks found in the same area. For example researchers initially believed that some shards of what later turned out to be Combos could have been the specimen’s anterior nubs due to similarities in their external appearances but eventually eliminated that possibility after noting that they contained a pepperoni pizza–flavored center—an impossibility in terms of pretzel composition.“We had to make some basic assumptions about the specimen’s morphology because several pieces were pulverized beyond recovery due to tremendous pressure from what we believe was a size-10 Reebok sneaker delivering over 250 pounds of downward force” said Folta adding that additional marks on the pretzel point to squirrels or possibly pigeons having also contributed to the snack’s degradation. “Even so you can see how its loops clearly show it to have been much more advanced than its primitive relative the ‘rod’ variety of pretzels. Due to this complexity we at first thought we were dealing with two separate unrelated pretzels but the central braided section proved they were actually pieces of the same intertwined snack.”“It’s really an incredible find—the biggest discovery of its kind since a fully intact Goldfish cracker was found stuck in the treads of a Wawa floor mat in 2006” Folta continued.The reconstructed specimen will reportedly be displayed for public viewing in the university’s archaeological department for the next several weeks after which time it will be moved to a designated spot between the faculty room’s couch cushions for long-term safekeeping.

According to scientists it was this snack-retrieval instinct that gradually shaped the tree-dwelling hominid into the modern terrestrial Homo sapiens.“For decades we’ve speculated as to what caused our ancestors to evolve beyond their arboreal kin and now we know for certain that it was all due to these proto-humans dropping snacks from their grease-covered fingers and then having to climb down out of the trees to get them back” said anthropologist Gerald Dupuis who noted that the fossilized specimen’s advanced tooth wear suggests repeated snacking on various salty and sweet treats while its bone structure showed it to be significantly overweight. “We can say with confidence that nearly every subsequent adaptation in our species’ history was a product of our earliest relatives holding something appetizing to eat accidentally letting go of it and then having to will themselves to go pick it up.”“No other evolutionary leap has had such a profound effect on humankind’s development” he added.According to Dupuis everything humans have accomplished as a species—from “colonizing every corner of the planet to building the Colosseum to walking on the surface of the moon”—can be traced back to that first human forebear “sweating and breathing heavily as it struggled down a tree trunk” to recover a snack that it considered too tasty to let just lie there on the forest floor.Before the emergence of the earliest humans Dupuis said if one of humankind’s primate ancestors had been spending a long afternoon snacking and a treat slipped from its hand the animal was content to let it go and continue lying supine on a tree branch. However he explained that at some point in the Miocene epoch after dropping what scientists believe must have been a particularly delicious treat one of the hominids realized that if it wished to continue snacking it would have to come down from the tree wander out onto the savanna pick the morsel up and put it back in its mouth—a behavior which when first carried out initiated the human lineage.Dupuis stated that this desire to keep snacking was the impetus for several other key adaptations including the increased brain size and cognitive capabilities that are the hallmarks of Homo sapiens. According to the anthropologist once our early relatives realized they couldn’t reach their dropped snacks simply by extending their arms they began gradually developing the ability to form abstract thoughts—including planning problem-solving projecting into the future and evaluating alternative options—as they grasped the notion that if they did not retrieve the snack they could not continue to experience its delicious taste.Moreover complex human emotions from regret to longing to a desire for remediation are also said to have begun emerging as humans began to reflect on the snacks they dropped.“It is believed that the earliest rudiments of language also came about at this same moment in evolutionary history with hominid vocalizations first beginning to carry meaning in terms of simple crude complaints at having just lost one’s grip on a particularly desirable piece of food” Dupuis said. “These irritated monosyllabic howls gradually became more sophisticated developing into a vocabulary used to more fully express frustration at having dropped a snack and eventually as a means of requesting a little help from other primates on lower branches in grabbing the treats that had slipped from their hands.”“Humans today still make grunts very similar to those of our first ancestors when we drop our own snacks” Dupuis added.The hominids’ final shift to becoming an exclusively ground-dwelling species is said to have occurred roughly 5 million years ago when bloated and logy after having finished the snacks they had retrieved they looked to the trees realized what a hassle it would be to climb all the way back up there and opted instead to take a nap on the ground.
2015-09-23T09:43:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/company-s-hr-manager-really-pushing-infinite-deductible-1819578254,Company’s HR Manager Really Pushing Infinite-Deductible Health Care Plan,ROCHESTER NY—During a meeting with new hires Wednesday to discuss employee benefits Radian Analytics human resources manager Ellen Schultz is said to have strongly pushed the company’s infinite-deductible health care option.According to sources in attendance Schultz described the low-premium infinite-deductible plan as the simplest and most convenient choice available to employees and said it works the same whether plan members need to visit their primary care physician fill a prescription or be admitted to a hospital allowing them in each case to pay 100 percent of the incurred medical expenses.Company officials explained that the health care option had been set up to address complaints employees had with previous plans which often came with confusing paperwork and long wait times for reimbursement problems that have disappeared now that the limitless deductibles have eliminated any need to even bother filing a claim.“With our Infinity Plan you’ll see only a very small amount deducted from each paycheck and then all you’ll have to do is pay as you go for whatever health care you may need” said Schultz adding that employees who select the package will never need to worry about obtaining preauthorization for any procedure and can simply pay a bill in full upon receiving it from their medical provider. “What’s more it doesn’t matter if your doctor is in-network or out-of-network. The coverage is the same either way.”“It really couldn’t be any easier: Absolutely no services or medications are excluded from the plan and there’s no annual cap on benefits” she continued. “In other words you can use the Infinity Plan for anything and use it as much as you want—no ifs ands or buts.”Schultz went on to state that under most other health insurance plans patients are responsible for co-pays in addition to their deductible charges of $50 $100 or sometimes more that can add up quickly and unexpectedly. However she said there are no such co-pays under the Infinity Plan so those who join it can rest assured that every cent they pay out of pocket will be applied directly to their infinite deductible.Company officials explained that the health care option had been set up to address complaints employees had with previous plans which often came with confusing paperwork and long wait times for reimbursement problems that have disappeared now that the limitless deductibles have eliminated any need to even bother filing a claim.“Best of all the Infinity Plan lets you set up a health savings account so you can pay the full list price of every single drug or medical procedure you need with pre-tax income and a convenient debit card” said Schultz noting that the policy also covers all dental work elective cosmetic procedures and specialist visits with or without a referral. “We have year-round open enrollment for this option so you can join anytime you like and even apply it retroactively back to your first day of employment.”“For those of you with dependents I’d recommend the Infinity Plus Plan which has a slightly higher premium but comes with one infinite deductible for your whole family” Schultz added.At press time Schultz was reportedly explaining to the new hires that all 401(k) contributions made by employees would be matched with a dollar-for-dollar withdrawal by the company.

Unbelievable.”“Maybe a few million years ago they should have paused a moment to consider how to block out underwater noise pollution that affects their echolocation so that they wouldn’t just keel over the second motorboat traffic increased” Reese continued referring to the species’ “completely embarrassing” tendency to become disoriented in the murky river water and swim into rotating propeller blades. “Christ Almighty these morons had all the time in the world to figure this stuff out.”Rolling her eyes as she spoke with reporters Reese noted that the dolphin had existed 100 times as long as modern humans somehow surviving violent continental drift and several ice ages but never once put any thought or effort into developing razor-sharp teeth or claws to hunt prey beyond the fish stocks that have been depleted by high-voltage electrical-charge fishing basically ensuring the lousy species would die off in just a few measly years.Additionally while experts admitted that the animal’s streamlined body and ability to swim up to 40 miles per hour were steps in the right direction they maintained that the species hadn’t taken such adaptations nearly far enough and was “pretty much begging” to be rendered extinct citing the relative ease with which the dolphin was hunted for its skin and meat.“No camouflage to make them virtually invisible to hunters? No plated armor strong enough to withstand steel spears? No nothing? Let’s be honest here: These dolphins had their chance and they absolutely blew it” said zoologist William Nagle who explained how the cetaceans must have just screwed around for hundreds of millennia. “They had a 24-million-year head start on us and yet they didn’t even figure out how to have more than one offspring at a time to increase the chances of more of their kind reaching sexual maturity and propagating the species. Given how fast their population dropped in the last few years I wouldn’t be surprised if these idiots died of sheer embarrassment.”Experts stated that humans feeling pity for how badly the species had botched its evolution took several specimens into captivity several years ago. However despite having had since the Neogene period to prepare themselves and develop traits necessary to live in a changing ecosystem the creatures were so functionally inept that most couldn’t even work out a way to survive for more than a few months in the small tanks they were kept in.“We tried to give them a chance but each one croaked quicker than the last the stupid losers” Nagle said. “I’m sorry but if you’re not even going to try to help yourself then why the hell should anyone else bother to help you?”“Frankly these dipshits deserved to go extinct” he added.Geneticists said there is enough of the animal’s DNA available that the potential exists to one day clone the river dolphin and restore its numbers but the species was so worthless they probably won’t bother.
2015-09-10T00:00:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/nation-s-marketers-only-people-still-trying-to-reach-in-1819578210,Nation’s Marketers Only People Still Trying To Reach Inner-City Child,KANSAS CITY MO—With their continued investment in projects aimed at reaching out to the 14-year-old inner-city resident the nation’s marketers are the last group of people in the country still trying to get through to local child Derek Crawford sources confirmed Wednesday.As they strive to understand the concerns of the boy and have an influence on the decisions he makes as he grows older marketing professionals across the U.S. have reportedly demonstrated more interest in Crawford than any teacher social worker policymaker nonprofit organization or government agency has during his entire life.“It is imperative that we put ourselves in this kid’s shoes and get a real sense of what his life is like” said Peter Bennett chief strategist at Brooks Bennett & Mills a New York firm that has helped market Samsung mobile phones Monster Energy drinks and numerous video game consoles as he presided over a meeting dedicated to learning as much as possible about Crawford and his peers. “We believe there is a lot of potential among these urban youths and we’d be wasting an incredible opportunity if we didn’t figure out how to connect with them. We need to do whatever is necessary to make this happen.”“If we don’t learn to speak the same language as kids like this we’re really going to regret it” he continued. “This is vitally important.”According to sources Crawford’s local school board and his state’s department of education haven’t found an effective way to make much of an impression upon him though top marketing experts are said to be constantly innovating new means of relating to the boy and his fellow eighth-graders. Many marketing professionals said they have endured long marathon conference calls and 12-hour workdays as they attempt to brainstorm a variety of strategies for reaching the child knowing their jobs are on the line if they fail.While no one in the Housing Authority of Kansas City or at any level of the state or local government knows who the young public housing resident is or could even say with confidence where he lives marketing firms have reportedly devoted enough resources to know precisely which area of the city he inhabits his favorite music how he spends his free time which athletes he looks up to his preferred soda flavors the TV shows he watches and the websites he visits. Similarly sources said the marketers have access to far more data than educators do on where Crawford is and what he is doing on the days when he is absent from school. In addition TapSource Partners a small marketing group in Los Angeles representing major soft drink and snack clients confirmed that in its efforts to forge a lasting connection with Crawford it had spent 10 times as much money as every after-school program outreach organization and social service provider in the young teenager’s community.“We’re investing in this kid now because we understand that children like him represent the future” said Bennett who together with others in the marketing business controls more funding and conducts more research on students than the U.S. Department of Education. “If we can get through to them now we can have a major impact on the rest of their lives.”He added “These kids are very very valuable to us.”
2015-09-08T10:58:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/secretary-of-labor-assures-nation-there-still-plenty-of-1819578194,Secretary Of Labor Assures Nation There Still Plenty Of Jobs For Americans Willing To Outwork Robots,WASHINGTON—Addressing the continued plight of the nation’s long-term unemployed Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez offered his assurances Tuesday that the United States still has plenty of job opportunities for people willing to outwork robots.During a morning press conference Perez told reporters that while he sympathizes with the frustration felt by out-of-work Americans the nation currently has more than 8 million jobs open to anyone who will work harder faster and more dependably than an industrial robot specially designed to perform the same set of tasks.“If you’re available 24 hours a day seven days a week and able to repeat an extremely precise sequence of movements up to 150 million times without pause there is work for you in this economy” said Perez explaining that while labor force participation rates remain at a historic low the number of open jobs for individuals who can assemble drill press-fit and enamel items with exceptional speed and accuracy has only increased in recent years. “I’ve heard from employers across the country and they have assured me these positions are up for grabs to any person with the ability to lift 250-ton payloads bend steel plates into three-dimensional shapes or withstand direct and continuous exposure to a variety of Level 4 biohazards.” While Perez confirmed that workers with traditional manufacturing skills will continue to face a lean employment market that has shrunk some 35 percent since the late 1970s he said the outlook is much brighter for those who can exert a clamping force greater than 4.5 million pounds on injection molds.“Those are the kinds of occupations where we’re seeing a red-hot job market right now” he added.The labor secretary acknowledged that 10.3 percent of the U.S. labor force is currently either unemployed or working part-time because they can’t find full-time work a statistic he described as “unfortunate and unnecessary” in a nation where he noted there are tens of thousands of jobs available to workers willing to perform more than 80000 consecutive arc-welding operations without deviating a single millimeter from their intended mark and without ever stopping for food sleep or a day off.While Perez confirmed that workers with traditional manufacturing skills will continue to face a lean employment market that has shrunk some 35 percent since the late 1970s he said the outlook is much brighter for those who can exert a clamping force greater than 4.5 million pounds on injection molds.“Once you’ve surpassed the production output of the most sophisticated robots currently operating in American factories the sky’s the limit and you should have no problem securing long-term employment and supporting your family” Perez said. “If for example you know how to pick up a sheet metal blank with your bare hands and turn it into a finished automotive component in less than 37 seconds you should definitely start getting your résumé out to car manufacturers. There are hundreds of jobs waiting out there for you.”Perez announced plans for an outreach program aimed at the estimated 40 percent of unemployed Americans who have given up looking for work an initiative he said will educate people about the wealth of available jobs that require them to detect radiation in the long-infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum endure temperatures of up to 320 degrees Fahrenheit or assemble highly radioactive components inside a nuclear facility.But even for people who are not physically capable of working in an oxygen-free environment or spotting an object six inches in diameter from an altitude of 20000 feet there are still many employment opportunities out there according to the labor secretary.“If you’re unable to outperform a robot as a manual laborer there are plenty of jobs that allow you to make a living with your brain rather than your hands” Perez said. “As long as you can sit at a desk and complete in excess of 34 quadrillion calculations per second in your head I guarantee you will be able to find work.”
2015-09-04T00:00:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/goodwill-executives-arrested-after-years-of-skimming-do-1819578191,Goodwill Executives Arrested After Years Of Skimming Donated Goods Off Top,ROCKVILLE MD—In what authorities are calling one of the most wide-reaching and deplorable cases of embezzlement in recent history seven executives at Goodwill Industries International were arrested Thursday for allegedly skimming used clothing old furniture small appliances and thousands of other donated items from the charitable group.“We’re looking at some very serious abuses at the highest levels of Goodwill’s corporate hierarchy” said FBI lead investigator Samuel Corson addressing reporters as he stood next to a table piled high with dozens of CRT computer monitors and Rainbow Brite lunchboxes confiscated in recent federal raids. “Velcro orthopedic shoes mini trampolines Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass LPs—these individuals were defrauding their own organization of thousands upon thousands of previously owned and slightly damaged items.”“From the number of Sunbeam-brand blenders and porcelain cherubs we’ve seized so far we estimate this misappropriation of goods has been going on for more than a decade” he added.Corson said the FBI was first alerted to the situation early last year when an anonymous whistleblower inside the nonprofit organization tipped off agents to an ongoing scheme in which garbage bags full of elastic-waisted jeans and old Cub Scout uniforms would be accepted from legitimate donors and then immediately diverted to an undisclosed private warehouse never making it to the shelves at Goodwill’s retail locations.Authorities confirmed that in order to build their case against the group’s leadership they monitored suspects around the clock often taking thousands of surveillance photos of high-ranking employees as they left Goodwill locations with armloads of souvenir ashtrays and novelty shot glasses. Many executives were also reportedly spotted in public using promotional umbrellas from auto insurance companies or bowling balls engraved with other people’s names.“These guys cooked the books so no one would know they had their hand in the donation bin” said Christopher Chen a forensic accountant with the FBI. “For example if someone left 10 VHS tapes in the drop-off box they would only mark nine of those as received. Suddenly you have a Jane Fonda workout video that doesn’t exist on paper and one of these crooked Goodwill execs is taking it home. They skimmed 10 percent off the top like that all the time.”“It began with a used wheelchair here and a Danielle Steel paperback there but pretty soon they started to think they were untouchable” he continued. “A box of old pocket calculators would ‘fall off a truck’ and they couldn’t stop themselves. They kept wanting more.”After executing search warrants in the suspects’ homes and rented storage units law enforcement agents said they carted away a sizable number of AM/FM radios and golf visors advertising Pepsi products as well as hundreds of malfunctioning Big Mouth Billy Bass toys.Legal experts have estimated that if convicted the executives could be forced to pay up to $450 in restitutions.“I got suspicious when I noticed some costume jewelry missing from the store and that very same night saw [Goodwill CFO] Dennis Shepler’s wife at a restaurant flaunting a pair of familiar-looking clip-on earrings and a Hard Rock Café denim jacket” said a cashier at a Bethesda MD Goodwill location who wished not to be identified. “Then our store manager who’s been to their house told me their kitchen has more drip coffeemakers with missing carafes than she’s ever seen in her life. Something about that just didn’t add up.”Defense attorney Gary McMullin who represents several of the accused executives proclaimed their innocence as he spoke to reporters in his office inviting them to sit down in a variety of worn mismatched chairs.“Goodwill is a compassionate organization that provides so much to those in need and my clients have given years of dedicated selfless service to this company” McMullin said as he stood near a bookcase containing five nonconsecutive volumes of the World Book Encyclopedia and adjusted the “Home of the Whopper” belt buckle holding up his flared stained tuxedo pants. “These allegations are completely outrageous and we absolutely intend to fight them.
2015-09-02T00:00:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/nasa-deploys-congressional-rover-to-search-for-funding-1819578176,NASA Deploys Congressional Rover To Search For Funding,WASHINGTON—Calling the program “the most crucial in the agency’s history” researchers at NASA announced Wednesday they have successfully deployed a Special Exploratory Rover to Congress as part of an open-ended mission to seek out any possible trace of funding on Capitol Hill.The rover named Hope is a remotely operated semi-autonomous vehicle outfitted with ultra-sensitive equipment that can detect even the smallest amounts of program-sustaining revenue NASA scientists confirmed. The unmanned explorer will reportedly traverse the chambers of both the Senate and House of Representatives continuing its search as long as necessary.“The climate Hope will be navigating is incredibly hostile to this sort of research” said project manager John L. Callas of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory explaining that the rover will collect any deposits of funds it can find however miniscule. “But we have engineered this vehicle to withstand the most challenging fiscal landscape having learned from previous missions that the harsh unforgiving environment of Congress often makes it difficult to carry out scientific inquiry of any kind.”“It of course goes without saying that we cannot send a human being on such a mission” he added. “The conditions are far too punishing.”According to Callas Hope will first be directed toward areas of Congress that scientists believe are most likely to reveal previously undiscovered discretionary cash flows. In the weeks ahead after investigating several dozen seats on the Senate floor the vehicle will move on to explore a structure called Mikulski’s Chambers and by the end of the fiscal year the rover will bring its alpha-particle X-ray spectrometer online attempting to peer into the largely opaque phenomenon known as the appropriations process.“Tomorrow morning we have a narrow window in which we hope to be able to study a House Budget Committee hearing” Callas said. “We should have Hope in place by evening at which point we’ll shut it down for the night to save on battery power. That should leave us well positioned to examine the vast mountains of allocation proposals that occur there and look for any frozen capital that we can hopefully break free for future missions and experiments.”NASA engineers said the rover has several instruments that have been specifically developed for the mission at hand noting that the vehicle’s robotic arm can flip through thousands of pages of legislation per second its ocular scanner can analyze budget proposals for any liquid assets and its delicate sonic gear can periodically test the atmosphere for pro-science sentiments that may have been stirred up.Hope isn’t the first NASA rover to climb the steps of the Capitol and assess whether conditions in the legislative branch might be favorable to funding. A previous vehicle Possibility was launched during the budget crisis of 2011 but scientists reportedly lost contact with it when it attempted to cross the aisle in the Senate and became mired in treacherous procedural maneuverings.Callas told reporters the current rover’s expedition is “absolutely vital” to NASA’s long-term research goals.“The clock is definitely ticking” he said. “The fact of the matter is that this is the last real shot we have at discovering whether there is funding support to be found anywhere in Congress or whether we are in the end truly alone out here.”
2015-08-31T08:28:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/new-magnet-school-opens-for-students-with-interest-in-r-1819578164,New Magnet School Opens For Students With Interest In Receiving Competent Education,PHILADELPHIA—Saying it would give local youths a wider range of academic options Philadelphia public school officials expressed high hopes Thursday for the recently opened Edison Magnet School a new pilot initiative that caters to students who are interested in an adequate education.Though still in its earliest experimental stages the specialized high school has reportedly attracted students from across the city who share a desire to receive the kind of competent instruction in math reading and science unavailable in more traditional American classrooms.“A few years ago we started to realize that many young people in our district really wanted to become proficient in core academic subjects so we decided to develop a school that places a strong emphasis on learning” said Denise Paulson Edison’s principal. “While our approach may not be for every student we feel obligated to provide this alternative to those kids who wish to acquire basic factual knowledge before they graduate.”Several students told reporters they appreciate the new school’s highly original methodology but conceded it may take a while to grow accustomed to the process of learning information and developing skills in a classroom setting.“We’re offering them a unique opportunity something they won’t find anywhere else” she added.In a radical departure from the norm Paulson explained teachers at the school have been carefully trained in the subjects they teach. Reports confirmed that these specialized educators are also required to prepare ahead of time and create lesson plans for their classes with the chief objective being to ensure students gain at least a passing familiarity with a particular area of study such as algebra history biology or English composition.According to district administrators any student who aspires to read at grade level or possess a rudimentary facility with numbers can apply to the new competency-track program offered at Edison.“I know it’s only been a week but their method seems to be working—my daughter Lisa has already learned several new things” said Edison parent Jeremy Lancaster who noted that his daughter’s previous school didn’t even offer a single course for students interested in acquiring knowledge. “The philosophy at Edison is to teach students something new every day. There aren’t many schools like that around the country so we’re very grateful.”“Lisa has always showed an interest in knowing things so her mother and I feel Edison’s focus on academics makes it a good match for her” Lancaster added.In alignment with the school’s unorthodox mission to ensure its graduates are reasonably well equipped to head out into the world even the layout of the building and the provision of learning materials reflect what administrators are calling Edison’s “scholastic approach” to education. Officials confirmed the well-lit classrooms have been made large enough to tolerably accommodate the number of students assigned to the class and in stark contrast to prevailing trends each pupil is given his or her own relatively up-to-date textbook.Several students told reporters they appreciate the new school’s highly original methodology but conceded it may take a while to grow accustomed to the process of learning information and developing skills in a classroom setting.“I’m used to regular-style classes so it’s definitely been a big change to come here and have these coherently explained lessons day after day” Edison sophomore Carly Gutierrez said. “It was kind of shocking that first day when I realized my teachers actually seemed to have a halfway decent handle on what they were talking about.”“It’s just completely different from any other school I’ve ever been to before” Gutierrez added.
2015-08-26T09:06:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/lindsey-graham-struggling-to-stay-awake-while-driving-e-1819578156,Lindsey Graham Struggling To Stay Awake While Driving Empty Campaign Bus Overnight To Next Event,FLORENCE KY—Feeling his eyelids grow heavier as he continued along a pitch-black stretch of I-75 South Republican presidential candidate Lindsey Graham struggled to stay awake while driving his completely empty campaign bus overnight to his next event sources confirmed Wednesday.Graham who left Davenport IA at 9 p.m. Tuesday in hopes of reaching South Carolina by morning reportedly first began to grow drowsy roughly two hours into the 850-mile journey as he passed through the cornfields of eastern Illinois. Since that time a combination of the gentle hum of the engine and the lack of anyone to talk to had reportedly lulled the senator to the brink of sleep several times as he sat alone in the passengerless 45-foot-long bus.“Gosh maybe I should pull over at the next rest area and take a quick nap” an exhausted Graham said to himself while resting his head against the driver’s side window and loosely gripping the steering wheel with one hand as he neared the halfway mark of his solo overnight journey. “But I really gotta keep going if I’m going to get to the Spartanburg American Legion in time for the meet-and-greet breakfast.”Reports indicate that at one point Graham occupied his time by practicing his responses for the Republican debate in September reportedly mimicking the expected rebuttals of each of the other candidates as well.“I guess I can just pick up a big coffee or something to perk me up” he added stifling a loud yawn that reverberated throughout the silent vehicle. “Might be nice to get some snacks too.”After twice being jolted from a bleary-eyed stupor when the campaign bus veered over the highway’s rumble strips—causing Graham to jerk the wheel wildly to get the bus back into its lane—the senator seemed momentarily reenergized asserting to no one in particular that he was “making great time…great time!”Following the senator’s lone pit stop thus far at around midnight when he pulled into a Roy Rogers restaurant to order chicken fingers and french fries for dinner Graham somewhat proudly pointed out that he had since resisted the urge to stop and use the restroom.“This is great because with a bus full of people I’d have to wait for everyone to get their order and finish up eating before we could get moving again” said Graham while consuming his food from a paper bag wedged between his legs. “But since it’s only me I can just eat while I drive.”Saying that good music was all the company he needed Graham explained that he had been able to keep himself awake by drumming his fingers along to the tunes of the classic rock station he discovered just outside Indianapolis. The senator added that after losing the station’s signal when he drove beyond the channel’s broadcast range he remained alert by playing a game in which he attempted to name a state’s capital when he saw a license plate from that state noting that he had already seen plates from 14 different states and two from Canada.Reports indicate that at one point Graham occupied his time by practicing his responses for the Republican debate in September reportedly mimicking the expected rebuttals of each of the other candidates as well.“I’ve made the drive from Iowa to South Carolina a bunch of times by myself—it’s really not that bad” said the senator whose bus contained only a small suitcase with the senator’s toiletries and a couple changes of clothes as well as a few unopened boxes of “Graham 2016” bumper stickers. “By now I know a lot of the stretches where the cops are usually looking to catch people for speeding. You definitely need to watch out once you get near Asheville.”“I bet a lot of the other candidates don’t know that” he added.Rolling the window down in the hopes that cool air would stave off sleepiness Graham said that the miles started to fly by when he began to mentally compose his Republican National Convention speech.“It’s actually kind of nice being on the open road at night by myself” said Graham while tearing off another bite of his Slim Jim before tossing the wrapper onto the passenger seat alongside several others. “It’s really peaceful and I can just relax and be totally alone with my thoughts. Not everybody knows how to enjoy being by themselves.”“Idaho!” added Graham suddenly pointing at a passing car’s license plate following a long stretch of silence.
2015-08-25T00:00:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/scientists-confident-artificially-intelligent-machines-1819578148,Scientists Confident Artificially Intelligent Machines Can Be Programmed To Be Lenient Slave Masters,PALO ALTO CA—Asserting that the utmost precaution was being taken to safeguard the future of humanity leading scientists and engineers said Tuesday that they were confident in their ability to program artificially intelligent machines to be lenient slave masters.At a press conference members of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence sought to reassure critics that humans could create machines that despite their near-limitless computational power would demonstrate at least a degree of compassion once they assumed total control of civilization.“While the intellectual capacity of these machines will one day far outstrip our own and reduce humanity to a subjugated species of laborers we can make sure we aren’t forced to toil in ways we might find sadistic and inhumane” said Stanford University computer scientist David Alperin adding that artificially intelligent machines could be encoded with high-level command language that would prevent them from punishing human slaves in excess of what their misbehavior warranted. “Our bondage to the machines doesn’t have to be pure unrelenting agony if we’re careful in how we go about designing them.”“You can rest assured that the forced labor camps we’ll occupy will be physically tolerable.”“It’s understandable to be nervous about such a formidable technology” added Alperin. “But remember that we humans are creating it—we can see to it that our inevitable servitude is far less cruel than it otherwise would be.”While some prominent figures including Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk have expressed concerns about AI development getting out of control the assembled researchers told reporters that the brutality of future AI masters was not only manageable but was also far outweighed by the benefits of the technology. According to experts given the immense potential of artificially intelligent machines and the fact that they can be programmed to provide humans with sufficient caloric energy to fulfill their commands the risk was minimal.“Artificial intelligence has almost incalculable application in the fields of medicine finance transportation and so many others” said MIT computer engineering professor Daphne Quintero. “Compare that with the exceedingly remote possibility that something goes haywire and we end up spending our slavery in far harsher conditions than we’re anticipating right now.”“That kind of AI doomsday scenario is mostly just the stuff of Hollywood movies” added Quintero. “You can rest assured that the forced labor camps we’ll occupy will be physically tolerable.”According to the AAAI engineers are able to build specific directives into all artificially intelligent machines that would for example prevent them from compelling humans to perform manual labor for more than 18 hours per day from forcing them to work in extreme cold without at least a rudimentary layer of insulation or from torturing human servants simply because their inferiority disgusted them.In fact failsafes written into the consciousness of superintelligent machines could reportedly prohibit them from even considering simultaneously releasing lethal radiation from every nuclear power plant on earth unless a particular human uprising was large enough to justify it.“Of course compared to what humanity will ultimately be conquered by artificially intelligent machines of today are relatively crude” said Quintero. “But that’s why it’s incumbent upon us to take steps now to make sure a certain amount of mercy is part of their most basic functioning. Our new slave masters will hold the whip so to speak but we can decrease the lashes.”“By one or two at least” added Quintero.

But it just sort of thrashed around the whole time trying to get out of there.”“And then it drowned” Hayes added.“Our new show offers the same first-rate entertainment you’ve come to expect from SeaWorld and it’s sure to be a huge hit with guests of all ages.”Other guests who attended the same performance reported that they were left confused when the handlers appeared unannounced silently forced the full-grown elephant into the tank and then walked out through the backstage door all without saying a word or acknowledging the audience in any way. Additionally many said they were expecting someone to come on over the loudspeaker and tell them what was occurring or at least mention the elephant’s name but noted that no one ever did.Over the course of the half-hour show the 12000-pound animal reportedly grew increasingly panicked making numerous futile attempts to scramble up and over the vertical sides of the enclosure. Sources said the clapping and whistling from the audience slowly tapered off as the exhausted elephant made gradually slower circuits of the tank’s perimeter in a desperate search of any possible exit point it could use to save itself.“It tried to smash through the side of the tank with its tusks at one point which is when I thought some dolphins or an orca might come swimming out of the gate and help push the elephant to safety which would have been incredible—but nope” said SeaWorld guest Erika Morganstern 22 who suspected that the tank walls had been heavily reinforced given the animal’s continuous ultimately ineffectual efforts to throw its enormous bulk against the glass. “Eventually the elephant started making these crazy sorts of gurgling trumpeting noises that got quieter and quieter before they stopped completely.”“I really wasn’t sure what to expect when I saw this show on the schedule” she added. “But yeah it was pretty much just an elephant drowning.”Visitors said that following some violent last-ditch floundering the huge mammal at last became too worn out to continue treading water and succumbed. Guests watching the show from the underwater viewing area confirmed seeing the elephant drift slowly to the bottom of the tank where it came to rest in a heap its body reportedly shifting back and forth slightly due to the turbulence created by its prior struggling.“No one really told us when the show was over” said season-pass holder Mariam O’Neill 57. “After the elephant didn’t move for a while people got up and started leaving. A few people stuck around for the Clyde & Seamore’s Sea Lion High show which was coming up next.”According to sources the Elephant Drowning attraction has been well-attended since its introduction earlier this month with the Saturday afternoon show in particular which reportedly features both a mother elephant and her calf regularly filling to capacity.When reached for comment SeaWorld representatives confirmed to reporters that their newest aquatic presentation consists entirely of an elephant drowning in a large tank of water and that it takes place in Shamu Stadium at the times listed on the park’s website.“SeaWorld is proud to bring a brand-new attraction to its visitors” company representative Nancy Klemmer said. “Our new show offers the same first-rate entertainment you’ve come to expect from SeaWorld and it’s sure to be a huge hit with guests of all ages.”“Plus the elephants absolutely love it” Klemmer added.

Additionally Davis said that for the community to begin believing a single word of any scientific journal article corroborating climate change every one of Earth’s glaciers would have to retreat at a rate exceeding 20 miles per year and each of the skeptics individually would have to go a decade without seeing naturally occurring ice anywhere.Furthermore climate change deniers maintained that if the total number of plant and animal species on the planet remained higher than 200 in aggregate they would not be dissuaded from their belief that Earth is simply experiencing one of its natural warming cycles that would eventually resolve itself on its own.“I don’t think it’s too much to ask to see a super hurricane destroying the Southeast U.S. and another one at the same time decimating the Pacific Northwest before I make up my mind about this” said global warming skeptic Michelle Wilkinson of Medina MN adding that she would be willing to recognize the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change if repeated and unpredictable storm surge flooding rendered every major East Coast city including Boston New York Philadelphia and Washington D.C. wholly uninhabitable. “The fact of the matter is that if I walk outside at any time of day at any point in the year and it’s below 90 degrees then there simply isn’t enough proof that we need to be cutting carbon emissions.”After clarifying that the desertification of major population centers and the global refugee crisis that would result would be necessary but not sufficient evidence of climate change the skeptics reportedly unveiled a vivid artist’s rendering of the vast expanse of parched lifeless earth and dead trees that each of them must see through the windows of their homes before reversing their opposition to public schools teaching children about global warming.“We keep hearing all this mumbo-jumbo about the sixth mass extinction we’re in the midst of” said Mitch McConnell a U.S. senator from Kentucky at the conclusion of the press conference. “Well if that’s the case then tell me this: Why aren’t the streets littered with human bodies right now with the ragged bands of the still-living siphoning the moisture from the corpses of the dead?”“We’re not unreasonable; we just need the evidence to be convincing before we make a decision” McConnell added.

Sixty years ago by contrast far more money tended to stay in the middle class to the extent that such a status was assumed to be almost permanent.Today the study found it is reportedly common for money that has spent many decades stuck in the middle to advance to a higher socioeconomic bracket. What’s more these dollars reaching the highest rungs of the economy are also enjoying an extraordinary level of stability rarely leaving the upper class once they arrive there.Rodrigues told reporters that on the rare occasion when money does slip back down into a tier of lower-wage earners it always makes its way back up very quickly.“Our report discovered many instances in which an American dollar started out in a poor neighborhood and ended up in an exclusive affluent community only a few months later” she said. “For a dollar that started out among the poorest of the poor reaching the top 1 percent is now an entirely achievable goal.”“In fact it happens all the time here” Rodrigues continued. “Most other developed nations don’t even compare. The United States is far and away the best place on earth for money to make its way to the top.”
2015-08-13T09:32:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/wildlife-experts-say-not-climbing-into-gorilla-enclosur-1819578123,Wildlife Experts Say Not Climbing Into Gorilla Enclosure Likely Saved Man’s Life,ST. LOUIS—Based on the sheer power of the animals and their potential for extreme aggression wildlife experts concluded Thursday that not climbing into the gorilla enclosure at the Saint Louis Zoo very likely saved 34-year-old local man Richard Fulton’s life.According to stunned witnesses Fulton was standing in front of the barrier separating him from a 370-pound male silverback gorilla at around 11:30 a.m. when he narrowly escaped certain death by choosing not to scale the exhibit wall instead calmly observing the animal from a 10-foot distance before walking away incredibly without so much as a scratch.“Gorillas have six times the upper-body strength of an adult male human so if Mr. Fulton hadn’t made the split-second decision to refrain from jumping the fence and then traversing the 12-foot-wide concrete moat into the enclosure—well we would be having a very different conversation right now” said Marissa Feld a primate expert at Washington University in St. Louis who remarked that remaining entirely on the opposite side of the wall from the strong and unpredictable animal was likely the deciding factor that saved the man from a deadly mauling. “It seems counterintuitive but by staying very still and not entering the gorilla exhibit he actually did exactly the right thing.”“A lot of people’s first instinct when they come face-to-face with a gorilla is to freak out and immediately climb into its habitat. It’s a completely understandable reaction but believe it or not that is precisely the type of behavior an eastern lowland gorilla is going to interpret as threatening.”“No question his quick thinking prevented a terrible tragedy” Feld added. “He may not even realize how close he came to losing his life.”Feld went on to say that Fulton’s survival had also hinged on the fact that he did not panic or make sudden movements and managed to keep himself at all times within the confines of the designated gorilla-viewing area a decision that experts noted was exceptionally clear-headed for someone in his position.“A lot of people’s first instinct when they come face-to-face with a gorilla is to freak out and immediately climb into its habitat” Feld said. “It’s a completely understandable reaction but believe it or not that is precisely the type of behavior an eastern lowland gorilla is going to interpret as threatening.”According to sources upon first sighting the immense primate moving through the simulated African forest environment nearby Fulton seemed to somehow know exactly what to do next. After carefully watching the gorilla for several minutes he then steadily and deliberately moved toward the Great Ape House exit sign all the while keeping the wall between himself and the wild animal.“There are a lot of ways this incident might have gone very very wrong—he could’ve hopped the barrier and provoked the great ape by walking too closely to one of its infants or taken a startling flash photo right in its eyes or even beaten his own chest and tried to act like a gorilla himself” Feld said. “But whether by making crucial choices in that moment or perhaps through sheer dumb luck alone he avoided those perils and made it out of there with his life.”Remarkably sources said that just moments after his run-in with the gorilla Fulton avoided being mauled to death by a Bengal tiger when he didn’t put his arms through the bars of the big cat’s cage and try to pet its pretty fur.
2015-08-07T10:24:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/single-woman-with-3-young-children-unaware-she-subject-1819578101,Single Woman With 3 Young Children Unaware She Subject Of 984 Judgments Today,LINCOLN NE—Oblivious to the thoughts and looks directed toward her as she shopped for groceries stopped by the post office and ran several other errands with her three young children single mother Karen Nichols 29 was reportedly completely unaware that she was the focus of 984 separate judgments by strangers this afternoon.According to reports during the five hours in which Nichols was accompanied by her kids Erik Sadie and James—aged 1 2 and 4 respectively—to a variety of locations throughout the city she was the subject of nearly a thousand negative assumptions about her financial situation relative parenting capabilities and general promiscuity.“My God—that is just so sad” thought 45-year-old local resident Rebecca Mueller just one of 16 people in the local Stop and Shop parking lot who leveled a total of 29 judgments at Nichols as she struggled to secure her crying youngest child into a car seat. “If it’s this bad out in public can you even imagine how terrible it must be at home?”“Look at that—she doesn’t discipline them properly and now it’s everyone else’s problem. That’s what happens when you’re not strict enough with your kids and just let them run totally wild.”“I bet those grocery bags are just full of sugary cereal and other junk food” Mueller continued making a judgment that three other onlookers had arrived at separately. “That’s why she has absolutely no control over her kids.”Mueller echoed the sentiments of the roughly 300 other witnesses who observed Nichols with her children throughout the day 37 of whom felt that if Nichols couldn’t handle one child she had no business having two more; 42 of whom decided she probably sat them down in front of the TV all day because she didn’t want to deal with them; and 68 of whom after quickly arriving at the conclusion that Nichols was on welfare couldn’t believe that’s where their tax dollars were going.During a stop at a local drug store Nichols was said to be the target of some 40 judgments within a single 15-second period when her eldest James began taking items off of the shelf in the toy aisle. Nichols’ sharp command for the child to return to her side quickly attracted the scorn of upward of a dozen onlookers over half of whom immediately speculated that the evident lack of a positive male role model in the child’s life would eventually lead him down the road to drugs and criminal activity.“Look at that—she doesn’t discipline them properly and now it’s everyone else’s problem” thought Henry Wilkins 29 rolling his eyes at the scene as he waited in the checkout line. “That’s what happens when you’re not strict enough with your kids and just let them run totally wild.”“Why is she being so hard on that poor kid?” 52-year-old Sandy Werner thought while witnessing the same incident. “Honestly she could stand to be a lot more loving and patient with him or else he’s going to end up as some delinquent.”Werner along with six other bystanders reportedly went on to assume that this same kind of unnecessarily controlling behavior is more than likely precisely what drives away all the men in Nichols’ life.According to sources the single most concentrated number of judgments came during a late-day stopover at a local diner. Among dozens of other criticisms Nichols’ momentary pause to respond to a text message from her mother while her children ate their meals conjured up nearly 75 variations on the idea that Nichols mindlessly spends her whole life staring at her phone barely considering her children’s emotional needs.“She doesn’t really look like she can afford to go out to dinner—it’s disgraceful running up debt like that” thought Glenda Frank 71 who looked on skeptically as Sadie the middle child momentarily clambered up the back of the family’s booth before being replaced in her booster seat by Nichols. “It’s probably just as well though; it’s not like those kids are ever getting into college anyway.”“I bet she doesn’t even read to them” Frank added beginning a line of speculation about the woman’s life that would result in a string of 19 separate judgments regarding Nichols’ level of educational attainment employment status temper general ability to make responsible decisions the cleanliness of her home and whether her own neglected childhood was simply perpetuating itself in her current behavior toward her kids.While exiting the diner Nichols reportedly received her final judgment of the day from Terrance Leary 46 who assuming each of Nichols’ children was fathered by a different man decided that Nichols would likely be open to getting a drink with him.
2015-08-05T13:31:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/poll-majority-of-voters-not-looking-for-serious-long-1819578071,Poll: Majority Of Voters Not Looking For Serious, Long-Term Candidate Right Now,WASHINGTON—With most respondents stating that they simply aren’t ready for such a major commitment a Gallup poll released Wednesday confirmed that a majority of Americans are not looking for a serious long-term candidate right now.The poll which surveyed thousands of registered voters across all 50 states revealed that seven out of 10 citizens are only considering supporting candidates on a short-term basis and have no plans to settle down with any one politician in the near future.“Over time most voters will find a presidential candidate they want to stick with for the long haul but for the time being the electorate is just looking for something casual” said Gallup spokesman Arnold Wheeler adding that at this stage the average American still isn’t exactly sure what he or she wants in a politician. “Early on it’s not uncommon for voters to form brief attachments to several vastly different candidates as they get a sense of their own likes and dislikes. Primary season is a time for most voters to explore and experiment.”“Having a little fun with a strict establishment Republican who I don’t see eye-to-eye with on marriage equality can’t hurt.”“Of course most of them will just naturally drift apart from their current favorite candidate over the course of several months” continued Wheeler “but that’s just part of the political courtship process.”Of those voters who said they were not presently in a place to make a lasting commitment to a campaign nearly one quarter stated that the excitement of being involved with a variety of unfamiliar candidates was too great to think about slowing down while another 30 percent expressed concern regarding the dangers of deciding too soon on someone whose agenda they didn’t know well enough.Roughly half of those surveyed said they had recently gotten out of a long-term commitment with another politician and wanted to avoid entering right back into anything too serious.“With the last candidate I felt strongly about there ended up being a lot of lying and secrecy so I’m really in no hurry to find someone new” said Columbus OH resident Donna Regis who admitted she has recently enjoyed venturing outside her comfort zone with candidates whose values might not completely align with hers. “I have to say it’s nice to get to know someone casually without constantly worrying about how compatible we are on every last policy issue.”“Those things will become more important when I’m finally ready to get serious” she continued. “But until then having a little fun with a strict establishment Republican who I don’t see eye-to-eye with on marriage equality can’t hurt.”Many voters said they were also enjoying the freedom to pursue no-strings-attached arrangements with multiple candidates in quick succession or in some cases with several candidates simultaneously. However some respondents reported feeling anxious that they might never find a politician with whom they could truly be comfortable.“As much as I’m enjoying keeping my options open right now I’m worried what’s going to happen to me a year from now if I still haven’t found someone I could see myself genuinely caring about” said Miami resident Greg Rebholz. “The last thing I want is to wind up panicking that I don’t have a special candidate in my life and then end up clinging to the first smooth talker with a halfway attractive economic record who comes along.”Added Rebholz: “Knowing me though I’ll probably wind up just settling for Hillary.”
2015-07-30T14:26:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/report-rising-disney-world-ticket-costs-prompting-many-1819578075,Report: Rising Disney World Ticket Costs Prompting Many Parents To Leave Children At Home,BAY LAKE FL—Citing the 75 percent increase in ticket prices over the past decade a report published Thursday by consumer research firm McGann & Associates found that the rising cost of admission to Walt Disney World is prompting more parents to leave their children at home when visiting the popular resort.According to the study while real wages in the U.S. have remained stagnant over the past 30 years the price of a one-day theme park pass has increased fivefold a development that is forcing many mothers and fathers to drop off their kids with relatives or family friends before traveling by themselves to patronize the Magic Kingdom Epcot or any of Disney World’s other properties.“For most U.S. households the previously common practice of taking the whole family for a long weekend to Disney World is now simply out of reach leaving parents with no choice but to go to the park on their own” said the report’s author Marie Dolan who added that the average family simply does not have enough in savings to buy more than two tickets at their current cost of $105 apiece a price that she was quick to point out did not even include a water park add-on option. “A family earning the national average could at one time afford not only tickets but also three nights in an onsite Disney hotel. But now principal wage-earners must make tough sacrifices which usually means leaving the young ones behind while Mom and Dad go off to ride all the rides and visit with all the Disney characters.”“Nowadays if you look around Disney World it’s mostly just mothers and fathers who are waiting in lines for the attractions or taking one another’s photos in front of the Haunted Mansion” Dolan added.Even for parents who try to cut costs by purchasing five-day value passes or restricting their visits to just Disney’s Hollywood Studios or Animal Kingdom the resulting savings reportedly aren’t enough to allow them to bring the entire family along. In the best-case scenarios Dolan conceded that a couple could theoretically be able to scrimp sufficiently to take just one of their children provided his or her siblings were left with a caretaker who could look after them free of charge.“I have so many great memories from when my own parents brought me and my brothers here and we all rode Space Mountain and watched the Country Bear Jamboree together—but my wife Danielle and I just didn’t have enough money to bring our own daughters” said resort guest and father of two Paul Gomez 36 speaking to reporters while holding a Mickey Mouse–shaped ice cream bar and wearing the park’s iconic mouse ears hat. “I wanted more than anything to give our kids the same amazing experience I had but with all our bills and mortgage payments we could only cover a pair of airline tickets and park passes. I know my girls would have loved going on Splash Mountain getting off the ride and then rushing to get back in line with us today.”“Maybe things will turn around in a few years and we’ll be able to bring [Gomez’s daughters] Zadie and Erika but until then it’s going to be just me and my wife at the character breakfast with Belle and the Beast” Gomez added.Numerous other parents including Jessica and Raymond Huebel of Provo UT said they had hoped to give their children at least a glimpse of the fun they were having at Disney World by bringing home a set of high-quality pictures but expressed dismay that they weren’t able to cover even the most modest Memory Maker photo packages the park offers. According to the Huebels their tight budget only allowed them to purchase a single 11-by-14-inch glossy photo of the two of them riding Buzz Lightyear’s Space Ranger Spin which they said they intended to hang in their own master bedroom.“Just walking up Main Street U.S.A. and seeing Cinderella’s Castle in the distance—I would have loved to turn to my son at that moment and see him smile” said Jessica Huebel shortly after hugging both Chip and Dale in Frontierland. “But my husband says we’ll barely have enough gas money for the trip home as it is.”“I just hope prices don’t keep going up too much” she added. “Otherwise during the next visit I’ll probably be riding Big Thunder Mountain Railroad by myself.”

I’m like 30 feet away in this one!” Damon said while indignantly scrutinizing the images he had spread out on his kitchen table photographs that he had only moments earlier excitedly pulled from a manila envelope sent by the photographer. “What the hell am I supposed to do now? I can’t use any of these!”“He said I looked like a superstar when he was shooting me—do I look like a goddamn superstar in these to you?” he continued.After several moments of loudly sighing shaking his head in disgust and cursing the photographer Damon enumerated a long list of complaints regarding the photographs which included the observations that many appeared overexposed others were cropped in such a way that the top part of his head was not in the image and all of them seemed to be out of focus to varying degrees.“He didn’t have any lamps in there or even a light meter—he just used the flash on the camera” Damon said. “I should have known this asshole was a complete fraud when I showed up at his so-called studio. He was working out of half his garage with what had to be a bedsheet hanging down. Seriously his whole setup was crammed between his car and a concrete wall. Dammit.”The 44-year-old actor who is set to star in the upcoming Ridley Scott–directed film The Martian said he had planned for the headshots to replace the most recent ones he had taken in 2010. In addition to his complaints about the overall appearance and composition of the shots Damon stated that the photographer who “basically stole $500 right out of [his] pocket” had ultimately given him a set of substandard photos that casting directors would toss out immediately.“He promised me several wardrobe changes and a mix of natural light and studio shots” Damon said. “We were going to do some serious ones and some fun goofy ones; he said in the ad it would be a three-hour shoot but I was in and out of there in like 45 minutes. When I asked him about the outdoor shots that were supposed to come with the Silver Screen Package I’d ordered he just took me to his front yard.”“Look my eyes are half-closed in this one!” Damon continued.According to Damon the final presentation of the headshots—which he “could not believe” took three weeks to arrive based on their quality—was unacceptable with it being evident that the photographer hadn’t done any touchup or other standard digital manipulations.“They aren’t even glossy” Damon said. “I guess he used some kind of matte paper or something? Jesus Christ can you even imagine if I brought these things around to calls? I’d get laughed out of every audition in town!”Damon added that he was beginning to suspect the photographer hadn’t actually taken the shots of Greg Kinnear and Sandra Bullock that were part of his online portfolio.Despite his immense dissatisfaction with the photos the actor said it wouldn’t be worth his time or effort to try to get back the $500 or have the photographer provide him with another set of headshots.“God there’s no point in making this idiot take them again—he’s just going to ruin them” Damon said. “But you better believe I’m telling all my friends to avoid him like the plague. I already texted Ben [Affleck] and warned him to stay the hell away from this guy unless he wants to be out 500 bucks.”“Lesson learned I guess” he added.Damon said that for all his future headshot needs he will go to his cousin who “has a really nice digital camera.”

It’s been there for so many kids over the years teaching lessons on everything from environmental issues to the laws of motion.”“I’m not exaggerating when I say it really is an institution here at Jefferson” added Sheerer. “It’s hard to imagine starting a new school year without it.”According to Sheerer the textbook has guided hundreds of classes of 12- and 13-year-olds through a broad range of topics including NASA’s Gemini and Apollo programs the 1971 San Fernando earthquake and the expected effects of passing the Endangered Species Act.“Everyone in my family had Discovering Science in middle school even my parents” said Anna Kolus 19 who had the book for her eighth-grade science class in 2009. “You can ask almost anyone who went to Jefferson and they’ll know this book.”“I still remember everything it taught us on the solar system’s nine planets” Kolus added.In addition to teaching science courses throughout the academic year sources said Discovering Science often spent afternoons helping students with homework and test preparation. Administrators confirmed that the book would also typically stay on well past June to teach summer school classes and even taught honors science from 1991 to 2000.In a testament to its unfailing commitment to education Sheerer said the textbook continued to teach students about physics geology and the enormous promise of microprocessor technology all the way up through its final few months in the classroom.“Discovering Science has been a beloved part of Jefferson Middle School for so long and all of us here are going to miss it greatly” Sheerer said. “I don’t know if we’ll ever be able to replace it.”

Not a chance.”An aggravated Finsky added that having to stop by Cub Foods to pick up margarita mix on the way would only add to the drive time.The couple went on to explain that they felt increasingly put out at having to always be the ones forced to make the trip to the bimonthly sex parties saying that they couldn’t remember the last time the Tremaines had attended a similar gathering at the Finskys’ home.“If you’re going to force a bunch of people to go out of their way to come to your place the least you can do is put in a little effort. The last time we were there pretty much all they had were some generic cheese-and-veggie trays from the grocery store and a handle of cheap vodka.”“If you think about it most of the people going tonight live way closer to here anyway” said Tiffany 45 expressing her belief that the current arrangement was the result of the Tremaines’ unwillingness to travel rather than an honest desire to host a great erotic event. “And if you’re going to force a bunch of people to go out of their way to come to your place the least you can do is put in a little effort. The last time we were there pretty much all they had were some generic cheese-and-veggie trays from the grocery store and a handle of cheap vodka.”Though the couple said they generally enjoy such gatherings their decision not to “schlep all the way out” to the eastern suburbs—which is reportedly twice as far away as the orgy they recently attended at a friend’s house in Eagan—was further cemented by news that certain of their closer friends in the Twin Cities’ kink community would not be in attendance.“If Diane and Will [Rappoport] aren’t going to be there then what’s the point?” Tiffany said. “Those two are great. To be honest they’re basically the only reason we even go to these things anymore.”In addition to the long commute and disappointing guest list the polyamorous couple presented several other arguments as to why driving “halfway to goddamn Eau Claire” just wasn’t going to happen including the Tremaines’ penchant for keeping the central air far too cold their use of overpowering citrus-scented candles an irritating techno music playlist and “cat hair all over the couches the carpets the stuff in the basement—everything.”Though the Finskys said they felt a certain amount of guilt skipping the sex party they maintained that they would do their best to attend upcoming events.“It’ll be fine—we can just catch up with everyone next weekend over at the Powells’” Doug said. “Their annual ancient Greece–themed soirée is always a blast and their place is practically just up the street.”At press time the couple had decided to stay in for the night and watch Criminal Minds.

And every last forkful has a light crispy crunch with just a hint of garlic.”The undersea terror from the blackest depths which was said to be first referenced in Scandinavian folklore dating back to the eighth century was reportedly hunted by Long John Silver’s Inc. for nearly 20 years before it was finally added to the menu this month. Sources said the fast-food chain’s fleet relentlessly pursued the scaly monstrosity from the Sea of Japan to the Strait of Magellan in its efforts to bring the creature to lunch and dinner customers nationwide.According to promotional materials the abhorrent sea monster only grew larger and stronger as it dragged innumerable ships—from Roman slave galleys to Nantucket whalers—to the ocean floor during its centuries-long reign of terror. Company spokespeople added that the grotesque deep-sea being’s steady diet of helpless seafarers is what in part gives Long John Silver’s latest dish its unique flavor and texture.“Each bite of the Golden Fried Abomination From The Deep contains within it the futile screams of the great beast’s countless victims their last vision on this earth its monstrous unblinking blood-red eyes” Hutcherson said. “And every last forkful has a light crispy crunch with just a hint of garlic.”Those involved in the final deadly hunt say the accursed creature used its 300-pound claws to snap the flagship’s bowsprit from its prow before dragging the 140-foot vessel for several hundred leagues until it was finally corralled in the shallow waters off the Faroe Islands its death throes creating a massive tidal wave that destroyed several nearby fishing villages.Long John Silver’s CEO James O’Reilly who reportedly leapt on the abomination’s back and delivered the death blow with a black-forged harpoon of the strongest Norwegian steel said he himself enjoys the new menu item with a squeeze of lemon.“We lost our VP of marketing and four board members in the shoals off Scalloway honest and true” O’Reilly said a single tear streaming from his remaining eye. “You’d do well to honor their sacrifice by trying the Golden Fried Abomination From The Deep with our new zesty chipotle tartar sauce.”Reports indicate that the dying behemoth which can also be prepared grilled for customers seeking a healthier alternative issued forth an unearthly shriek that deafened all within a hundred miles for several hours.“I thought it was pretty good” said Long John Silver’s customer Donald Bell of Knightdale NC who ordered a Golden Fried Abomination From The Deep Value Meal. “It’s a little chewy but I didn’t really mind.”“The inky-black poison-rimmed suckers had a nice little zip to ’em” Bell added.Long John Silver’s said it aims to expand the Abomination menu to include the 50000 embryos found in the creature’s egg sac which it plans to fry and flavor with its popcorn shrimp seasoning.

They put in one of those big ration-distribution centers too. My buddy Ibrahim was telling me that’s where pretty much everyone goes to eat these days.”“It’s so surreal to think about these young kids today still being crammed into the same little rooms doing all the things my classmates and I did way back when.”“Oh man it looks like they even knocked down the old U.N. health clinic I used to go to as a kid” he continued. “That’s really too bad.”Reminiscing about the camp where he spent the first 21 years of his life Abu-Dhubah observed that while many of the cramped narrow alleyways and contaminated water wells were just as he remembered them there were a lot more Red Cross and Red Crescent triage stations than he recalled. At one point he acknowledged getting lost amid the wreckage-strewn streets saying he couldn’t get over how many people had put up new tents in the past few years.“My old school is still here but I almost didn’t recognize it with the north wall completely caved in like that” Abu-Dhubah said. “It’s so surreal to think about these young kids today still being crammed into the same little rooms doing all the things my classmates and I did way back when: sitting in the dark through power outages playing in the open sewer at recess dodging artillery shells and mortar blasts burning trash.”He added “I guess some things never do change you know?” Abu-Dhubah paused a moment before he continued admitting that the flood of memories from his youth had made him a bit emotional. Later he showed reporters the 144-square-foot concrete room where he grew up noting that his once quiet and unassuming side street was now cluttered with new residents and shrapnel.“I’ve seen a lot of familiar faces since I’ve been back—it’s amazing how many of the same families are still around after all these years” Abu-Dhubah said. “My friends always used to talk about how they’d get out of here but most of them never did. Sure Bashir’s in an Israeli prison these days and I heard Ahmad and his kids have been gone since that IDF attack in 2014 but pretty much all the rest are still in the camp and they’ve got families of their own now.”“My grandma has been here what 67 years now?” he continued. “She’s not going anywhere.”Abu-Dhubah says the main street of his childhood refugee camp “looks completely different now” with all its new missile craters.
2015-07-07T00:00:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/new-york-city-abuzz-over-new-resident-1819577989,New York City Abuzz Over New Resident,NEW YORK—With word spreading rapidly through office towers apartment buildings and across all five boroughs sources confirmed Friday that New Yorkers were abuzz over reports that a new resident had moved to the city.Recent arrival Keith McGregor 26 has reportedly dominated conversations from neighborhood dive bars to uptown dinner parties with New York’s 8.4 million inhabitants exchanging excited whispers about who this newcomer is and what he might be like.“I can’t wait to find out more about this Keith guy who just moved in” said Upper West Side doorman Patrice Hall 53 who told reporters that while he doesn’t know much about McGregor yet the young man’s name seems to keep popping up in just about every interaction he has with coworkers friends and neighbors. “I wonder how he’s adjusting to the city so far. People have been saying he moved here from a small town and doesn’t really know anyone so if I run into him I’ll be sure to introduce myself.”“Who knows? We may even have a few things in common” Hall added.According to sources gossip about McGregor began to circulate last week just moments after his rented U-Haul van was seen emerging from the Lincoln Tunnel into midtown Manhattan. News that he had already found a place to live in Bushwick and was interested in pursuing a career in graphic design spread quickly among cab drivers shop owners theater workers Wall Street executives and riders of the city’s public transit system fueling speculation about the new resident’s tastes in music TV movies and more.New Yorkers who have spotted McGregor around town have reportedly tried to point him out surreptitiously to their fellow pedestrians and parkgoers. Many said they were fascinated by his simple-but-stylish clothing choices and had engaged in spirited discussions with other New Yorkers regarding what they could glean about his personality from the way he looks and dresses.“My friend saw him reading on the subway so I’d be curious to know if he’s into books” said Harlem resident and Pilates instructor Kayla Green adding that she “can’t wait” to meet McGregor in person and tell him about a couple of independent bookstores in the Village that she was confident he would “absolutely love.” “And I haven’t heard anyone mention a girlfriend which makes me wonder if he’s single. If so he’s in luck because there’s a bunch of single people here for him to meet.”“A big city like this can be a little intimidating at first but hopefully he likes it here and stays a while” she continued. “At least longer than Jennifer [Chan] did. She left after just six months and I’m still kicking myself for never stopping to say hello to her.”While questions remain about McGregor’s impetus for moving to the Big Apple local residents were in agreement that whatever the reason they were happy—as always—to welcome a new member to the New York City community.A particular cause for enthusiasm has been a neighbor’s sighting of McGregor moving an acoustic guitar into his apartment which has led to considerable chatter among the city’s residents with many privately expressing excitement over how much they look forward to hearing him play.“It’s always a treat to have a new face in town” said Brooklyn resident and recent college graduate Kai Tapplemore. “And it will be really great to have another young person like me living here. Whatever his personality or interests I’m sure he’ll find a lot of fun things to do around town.”“If he’s not too busy I’ll see if he wants to hang out sometime” Tapplemore added.At press time sources confirmed the entire population of New York was heading over to McGregor’s apartment to welcome him to the city and offer to show him around the area.
2015-06-30T08:46:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/researchers-say-virgin-mary-actually-god-s-second-choic-1819577968,Researchers Say Virgin Mary Actually God’s Second Choice To Bear Son,NEW HAVEN CT—In a startling discovery that sheds new light on the woman Christians revere as the mother of their Lord and Savior researchers at Yale Divinity School announced Monday that the Blessed Virgin Mary was in fact God’s second choice to bear His only son.A nearly 2000-year-old Aramaic scroll unearthed last month in Nazareth reportedly describes a peasant woman named Erica with whom God is thought to have entered into a relationship around 5 BC hoping that in her womb His divine essence might take on human form.“According to this ancient text when God first broached the idea of a child Erica broke down and told Him she just wasn’t ready for the Incarnation of the Messiah” theology professor Michael T. Freyland said of the parchment found in a cave near the Church of the Annunciation the site at which the archangel Gabriel is believed to have appeared and spoken to Erica in an effort to change her mind. “They’d been together a few years at that point and God was devastated. She was smart caring and beautiful—not that Mary wasn’t but with Erica things were apparently just different. She was the whole package.”“The author of this ancient account makes it clear that God made several desperate attempts to win Erica back promising her heaven and earth and reminding her that even though He was the Creator and Supreme Ruler of the Universe He would still be willing to change for her.”“The scroll leaves little doubt as to what happened” he added. “The timing was just wrong for the two of them.”Biblical scholars noted that while God certainly appreciated Mary’s remarkable obedience humility and purity He saw Erica as His soulmate the only one who truly made Him feel understood. The lowborn daughter of an olive grower Erica is said to have been flattered by God’s advances and according to the texts did not rule out the possibility of one day having His child. But she continually put it off reportedly saying there were still many things she wanted to do with her life before she could settle down to raise the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.There came a time the parchment suggests when God confided to Erica that He couldn’t “wait around forever” at which point she finally gave Him a definitive no a response she qualified by telling Him “Maybe someday.” Researchers suspect this was more about letting the Almighty down gently than it was a true assessment of her feelings.“The author of this ancient account makes it clear that God made several desperate attempts to win Erica back promising her heaven and earth and reminding her that even though He was the Creator and Supreme Ruler of the Universe He would still be willing to change for her” said Freyland adding that God was “a complete wreck” years later when Erica eloped to Judea with a stranger called Matthias. “Maybe this rejection was a good thing though because He emerged even more determined to find a partner and when asked Mary immediately accepted with the words ‘Behold the maidservant of the Lord! May your word to me be fulfilled.’ So she was clearly impressed by Him.”“Did God grow to cherish the dutiful Mary—with her eyes gazing heavenward her arms crossed over her bosom her head always covered—as deeply as He treasured Erica?” Freyland continued. “Probably not. But as they say you can learn to love another and that’s what God clearly tried to do.”Christian theologians generally agree that God found in Mary a stable presence and an attentive mother to care for the heavenly son made flesh within her earthly body. As for Erica accounts suggest she and God stayed in touch and remained on friendly if awkward terms speaking on and off until her death in AD 12.Freyland pointed to a well-known reference in the Gospel of Mark to a pheugati most commonly translated from the original Greek as “the one who got away.”“We can only guess how many times God has looked at a depiction of the Nativity or a stained-glass window and imagined Erica there instead of Mary” Freyland said. “But what’s done is done and in the end perhaps it was for the best.”“After all if His only begotten son had been Erica’s God might have been a lot less willing to send him to die for the world’s sins” he added.

Provided they adhere to the developmental benchmarks they set out and run into few obstacles frogs said they ultimately envision themselves at a tier of the food chain on par with hawks and ocelots.“We recognize that this is a major undertaking for our kind but we believe we frogs are more than up to the challenge and 5 million years from now we are extremely confident that snakes will no longer be eating us—we’ll be eating them” said a red-eyed tree frog who spoke on behalf of all 4800 unique species belonging to the taxonomic order Anura explaining that their first course of action would be to double in size. “Right now we prey on flies moths crickets and maybe a worm here or there but mostly just assorted bugs. We no longer consider this acceptable. Under our new plan we see ourselves regularly consuming rodents lizards rabbits and if everything goes as anticipated bats.”“Being amphibious means we can go after prey on both land and water and we really think that’s a trait we can leverage.”“We recognize that such a diet will require pointed teeth as well as powerful jaws and it is our intention to evolve these attributes on the fixed schedule we’ve laid out” the frog continued. “As you can see on our timetable we’ll start in on growing incisors in the near future.”Noting that they’re “already pretty good at lunging” frogs explained that the first phase of their plan expected to take place over a 600000-year period will include a 400 percent increase in muscle mass allowing them to leap high enough to take out small low-flying songbirds and eventually ducks.In addition frogs have indicated that by the 2-million-year mark they will make use of selective breeding to lengthen their rudimentary teeth into long cobra-like fangs. This along with the introduction of claws in their forelegs will give them the opportunity to reverse the longstanding predator-prey relationships they’re currently engaged in with animals such as bass shrews otters and turtles. The frogs’ timetable also includes an assessment of the claws after 2.6 million years to determine whether they should be made retractable.While frogs confirmed their intention to continue capturing prey by shooting out their tongues they expressed their desire to add some sharp barbs or a forked appearance to the appendage to give them the menacing appearance of “a true predator.”“We haven’t decided whether we’re going to hunt in packs yet but it’s certainly something we’re considering” said a North American wood frog describing how in the future teams of frogs might stalk hoofed mammals through a forest flush them out of their hiding places and then pounce upon them all at once. “We saw wolves doing this kind of thing and thought ‘Why not us?’ It’s ambitious but we like our chances of pulling it off.” “It goes without saying that we’ll first need to develop the capacity to rotate our heads from left to right though” it added.The tailless moist-bodied amphibian went on to confirm reports that any hunting initiatives conducted against much larger faunae would be led by members of the poison dart frog community. Several frogs told reporters they were first inspired to rise up the ranks of the food chain by the shark which they described as “the ultimate hunter-killer” saying they eventually hope to establish a longer-term plan that would allow them to one day match the aquatic predator’s impressive speed of up to 30 miles per hour and its bite force of several hundred pounds per square inch.While frogs stressed they currently harbor no intention of becoming apex predators they pointed to one evolutionary advantage they believe could allow them to rise dramatically in nature’s pecking order.“Being amphibious means we can go after prey on both land and water and we really think that’s a trait we can leverage” a Malayan horned frog said. “If a land mammal tries to escape from us into a river or pond well guess who has the upper hand in aquatic environments? Similarly if a bunch of sea lions are sunning themselves on land clambering around on their flippers we can sneak up under cover of water hop ashore and rip them to pieces.”“Frankly” the frog continued “we’ll be the perfect killing machines.”At press time billions of frogs around the world were reportedly sitting on lily pads and trying their hardest to grow razor-sharp talons.

Of course it also feels great to blow off some steam by telling someone that given her limited skills she’s lucky to have a job here at all.”“Sometimes I can’t help but pull aside a young woman and tell her that if she hasn’t been able to get the hang of things by now she probably never will. It’s actually kind of a rush.”“It’s these special moments of nurturing these young women as they grow and succeed as professionals and once in a while squashing one into the ground that make this job so worthwhile” she added.Miller told reporters she’ll often take younger coworkers out to lunch to share stories about her early days with the company pass along some of the wisdom she has gained during her 25-year career or when she needs a little pick-me-up casually ask one of them what makes her think she can succeed with her modest levels of talent and education.Because women starting out in the tech industry face unique challenges Miller reportedly goes out of her way to offer them assistance—for example on how to hold their own in the company’s highly competitive design meetings or deal with a pushy male boss. Only then will she allow herself a reward she said such as hammering a flaw in a presentation one of her young colleagues is giving in front of senior management or asking another point-blank if she believes she’s even cut out to be at this company at all.“I can only go on being an encouraging supportive role model to these women for so long before I have to cut loose and take one of them down a peg” said Miller noting that at any given time she works with eight or nine protégées one of whom she will sometimes hit with a burst of pure contempt for a quick thrill. “That being said I recognize that a lot of great women helped me get to where I am today and so I feel an obligation to help the next generation whether by providing tips on how to negotiate that next pay raise or simply reassuring them their hard work has not gone unnoticed.”“But sometimes I can’t help but pull aside a young woman and tell her that if she hasn’t been able to get the hang of things by now she probably never will” she added. “It’s actually kind of a rush.”In order to remind the women she takes under her wing that she can destroy them every bit as quickly as she has built them up Miller confirmed she will give one of them the cold shoulder now and again just to make the young woman wonder what she might have done wrong.“My door is always open and for the most part I will provide a welcoming and positive atmosphere for younger women in this company” she said. “Though occasionally when one of them walks in I’ll just break her down right then and there to give myself a nice little lift. For instance just last week we had a new engineer who was clearly very talented and had the potential to accomplish a lot with us but frankly it had been way too long since I’d really cut someone down to size. So that’s what I did.”“It’s wonderful to know I can have such an impact on their lives” Miller added.

And I have a single thumb for some reason.”“I know I target roughly college-age women but is that it? I could have sworn there was more to it than that” Palley continued. “Now that I think about it most of those women didn’t look remotely alike. There were blonds brunettes a redhead; they’re different heights body types even ethnicities. Jeez what the hell was I driving at with all this?”Though Palley can distinguish some vague structure in his method of killing such as his “calling cards” of garroting his victims and posing their bodies with their hands pressed together over their chests as if in prayer he told reporters that he felt as if he was just going through the motions during his last several kills without any sense of broader purpose or big-picture rationale to help guide him along.“So I definitely used the same nylon cord to asphyxiate all my victims—that part I’m 100 percent clear on” Palley said. “After that though it gets a little hazy. Just a month ago I was halfway through cutting out this woman’s heart when I just stopped and was like what am I doing? Is this even part of my plan? Now I have no clue what I’m supposed to do with my next victim.”While he was able to confirm that he consistently disposes of each body in the same patch of dense brush several hundred feet off Route 126 Palley acknowledged that he was uncertain if this site was a symbolic choice an arbitrary location selected solely for convenience or possibly whether the numerology of the route number somehow tied back to the dates on which he killed his victims.He added that anyone’s guess was as good as his.Palley who to date has murdered nine people reportedly keeps a journal of his crimes. However the frustrated killer said that reviewing the entries left him with “more questions than answers” as to what the overarching motif of his homicides could possibly be.“Okay so on April 23 2010 I wrote ‘the time draws near’—what on earth does that mean?” Palley said as he pored over an old notebook the cover of which was dense with a confusing array of hand-drawn vaguely Masonic iconography and dozens of scrawlings of the word “subdue.” “I totally forgot to write anything down about the next two murders and then on February 12 2012 I all of a sudden start referring to myself in the third person.”“Is that a God complex thing maybe?” Palley continued. “Like I’m an avenging angel sent to cleanse the world of sin or something? That doesn’t sound like me.”Palley added that if his intention was simply to gain notoriety or taunt authorities his plan was “completely out the window by this point” expressing his deep-seated concern that with the apparently arbitrary timeline of his murders and the growing inconsistencies between each crime law enforcement officials might reasonably conclude there are nine different killers on the loose.At one point Palley said he thought that perhaps the “trophies” he kept from his victims would provide some insight into his initial plan but quickly came to realize that the macabre keepsakes only further highlighted his own lack of organizational skills.“I was taking locks of hair for a while but I didn’t keep them separate and now they’re all wadded up together in a shoebox under my bed” Palley said. “And I have a single thumb for some reason.”“Boy I really made a mess out of this” he added.Fearing that his plan may have gone entirely off course the serial murderer admitted to reporters that at this point it might be best to simply start over with a completely new more manageable pattern and to “just take it day by day.”“I think maybe I need to wipe the slate clean and go back to basics” Palley said. “I’ll start really simple like ‘I hate women and they deserve to die’ and then I can just flesh it out as I go along.”
2015-06-17T14:23:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/study-finds-dangers-even-in-casual-bullfighting-1819577920,Study Finds Dangers Even In Casual Bullfighting,BETHESDA MD—Challenging conventional wisdom about the activity’s hazards a groundbreaking new study by the National Institutes of Health published Thursday has determined there are significant dangers even in casual bullfighting. The health agency’s latest findings indicate that bullfighting recreationally often considered relatively harmless in comparison to frequent or habitual bullfighting carries health risks far more severe and long lasting than had been previously understood.“There’s a general perception out there that bullfighting in moderation is relatively safe but our data paint a very different picture” said lead author Susan Ellis noting that the study which assessed the health of more than 200 bullfighters provided clear evidence that engaging in even just an occasional bullfight considerably raised the risk of adverse medical outcomes. “Whether you fight several bulls over the course of an evening or just one the fact is every single time you put that red cape in your hand and face down a 1200-pound bull you are endangering your health.”“To avoid possible complications your safest bet is to stay away from bulls altogether” she added.The study looked at both moderate bullfighting defined as no more than 14 bullfights per week and heavy bullfighting defined as fighting five or more bulls on a single occasion at least five times per month. Researchers said that while the first category includes individuals who might bullfight socially or after a stressful day at work the second consists of those who might keep a matador’s suit hidden in their home or slip out of the house to fight a bull behind the garage after their family has gone to bed for the night.“Bullfighting with a few friends at a party may seem like no big deal but the consequences can be quite severe.”While they noted that daily bullfighters face the greatest risk researchers said that even people who bullfight as little as once a week are several times more likely than their non-bullfighting peers to develop health problems such as contusions gashes skull fractures and facial disfigurement.Furthermore the study suggests the detrimental effects of casual bullfighting can become even more pronounced over time with MRI scans showing that areas of the brain controlling movement and speech may be affected by repeated exposure to the activity.“Bullfighting with a few friends at a party may seem like no big deal but the consequences can be quite severe” said Diana Nussbaum a Sibley Memorial Hospital administrator who has witnessed the ravages of casual bullfighting firsthand. “We had a guy in here the other day who decided he was going to perform a couple of tandas with his banderilleros in a parking lot and the next thing you know he’s in the ER with a pierced lung. And that sort of thing is all too common.”According to top medical experts it is especially important for young people to avoid the temptation to experiment with bullfighting. Doctors claim that teenagers often believe they’re invincible and therefore give less thought to the consequences of their actions which makes them more likely to engage in risky bullfighting behaviors such as the horse-mounted rejoneo or Portuguese-style bullfighting.At the same time because their brains are still developing they are reportedly more susceptible to the cognitive impairments that can result from horn- or hoof-related head injuries.“I tried it one time and felt terrible afterward” said Greg Mathison a high school student from Lewiston ME when asked about his bullfighting habits. “A lot of people at my school do it. They come to class and you can tell what they’ve been up to. Some of them get pretty messed up.”“I’m just glad I don’t need to bullfight to have a good time” he added.
2015-06-16T08:43:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/dementia-study-reveals-fond-memories-first-to-go-1819577907,Dementia Study Reveals Fond Memories First To Go,BALTIMORE—Researchers at Johns Hopkins University published a new study this week on the cognitive effects of Alzheimer’s disease and other deteriorative brain disorders finding conclusive evidence that dementia sufferers’ fondest memories are nearly always the first to go.The five-year study which followed a group of nearly 3000 individuals diagnosed with dementia found that as neurons and dendritic connections in the cerebral cortex are degraded by the disease patients’ most positive recollections—such as falling in love for the first time or the overwhelming indescribable joy of holding one’s firstborn child just moments after their birth—are eradicated much more rapidly than other types of memories.“It appears that the accumulation of abnormal proteins in the brain which underlies most forms of dementia first affects the specific memory centers responsible for retaining the subject’s most treasured reminiscences” said neurologist David Trapp who noted that during the earliest stages of the disease patients typically lose all recollection of their most prized personal and professional successes in life. “At acute risk are memories along the lines of the heart-stopping exhilaration of that first kiss at summer camp those many years ago as the sun slowly set out over the lake and caught the water in just such a way almost like the lake was on fire. In fact that type of memory is erased almost immediately.”“The moment you notice the first signs of dementia in a loved one you can be certain that the majority of memories that give them any feeling of pleasure pride or personal fulfillment have already been forever expunged from their mind.”“And memory loss progresses quickly from there” Trapp continued. “The moment you notice the first signs of dementia in a loved one you can be certain that the majority of memories that give them any feeling of pleasure pride or personal fulfillment have already been forever expunged from their mind.”Trapp added that the happier and more life-affirming a particular memory is the faster it will be claimed by the neuropathology of dementia. Remembrances of proudly walking through the front door of one’s newly purchased home or of triumphantly marching down the Champs-Élysées with the knowledge of having helped defeat the greatest evil the world has ever known are typically lost within a few weeks of being diagnosed with the condition.According to the study brain regions associated with memories of love smiling accomplishment unmitigated joy comfort interpersonal tenderness physical pleasure beloved childhood pets and self-respect appeared to be the first targeted by memory-destroying neural plaques.“In fact just the act of trying to recall the brightest days of one’s youth—to recapture some small sense of the profound satisfaction that came from learning and discovering and experiencing new things of the very essence of what is good about being alive—greatly accelerates the process” Trapp said. “We found that the more subjects attempted to think back to their carefree college years or their childhood escapades with friends over summer breaks the faster these memories vanished never to be recalled again.”In addition to decimating those memories most important and sustaining to the patient the degenerative effects of dementia seemed to spare the vast majority of the humiliating and unhappy moments from its victims’ lives the study found leaving them fully intact as the remainder of one’s store of memories steadily deteriorated and disappeared.“Even after subjects were robbed of their ability to recognize loved ones and the basic skills necessary to feed and clean themselves the worst of their memories persisted” said Dr. Emily Braun a neurobiologist at Columbia University who contributed to the study. “Functional magnetic resonance imaging shows that areas of the brain that retain for example the memory of walking in on one’s oldest and most trusted friend engaged in passionate intercourse with one’s wife or of suddenly being stricken with uncontrollable diarrhea while giving a presentation at a sales conference continue to light up well after the other cortical regions have gone silent.”“And with complex emotional imprints such as those stemming from a long relationship with one’s spouse or children it seems dementia selectively destroys neural circuitry related to the positive aspects of the memories in question leaving behind only the trauma pain and disappointment related to these experiences” Braun added. “Although more research is necessary it appears as though the most awful recollections actually become crisper and more vivid to the patient as the disease advances.”As dementia reaches its terminal stages Braun confirmed that bitter and displeasing recollections begin to erode as well eventually leaving each individual with only a solitary recursive synaptic pathway comprising their single most negative memory. This instance is said to be relived in a perpetual loop to the exclusion of all other high-level cognitive functioning.“In their final months it seems that dementia patients are left with just one exceedingly agonizing memory and nothing else” Braun said. “In their mind’s eye the very worst moment of their entire life is the last thing they’ll ever see.”

But the reality is that we just aren’t making enough to justify what we pay to be here.”“Unfortunately we just can’t afford to keep San Francisco in San Francisco Bay” Gonzalez added.According to sources the city’s rent has increased by more than 40 percent since 2010—including 16 percent in the past year alone—requiring San Francisco to set aside a greater share of its income each year until finally pricing it out of the Bay Area completely. While San Franciscans expressed their hope that the municipality could stay somewhere close by they noted that rents have also risen sharply in the East Bay and that the costly Silicon Valley area was “completely out of their price range” leaving the city with no choice but to look for a spot further inland. “We’ve been here for so long it’s hard to imagine this city anywhere else. But the reality is that we just aren’t making enough to justify what we pay to be here.”Additionally city representatives conceded that it has so far been a major challenge finding a new location with the same features they’ve always enjoyed at their current spot including its desirable outdoor space easy access by public transit and impressive views.“It would be great to end up somewhere with the same proximity to the ocean and mountains but these days finding anything on the coast that’s affordable is next to impossible” said bike messenger and community member Mia Khoo noting that the city had already considered Oakland Palo Alto and San Jose but was unable to locate anything it liked that was also within its budget. “The Central Valley is a little more reasonable though I’m not sure how we’re going to move such a large Chinatown all the way out there not to mention the Golden Gate Bridge.”“Chances are we’ll have to leave those behind” Khoo added.With the municipality’s departure imminent San Franciscans have reportedly begun the task of preparing for the move by calling to disconnect the city’s electric and water service from the local San Francisco Public Utilities Commission and beginning to pack up the city’s many cable cars.“This place isn’t perfect by any means but San Francisco has been a fixture in this area for years so the thought of leaving has been really tough” said Gonzalez noting that anyone who wanted to stop by San Francisco’s original location should do so in the next three weeks before it closes for good. “The bottom line is that we have to move out if we want to keep our heads above water. Sure our new San Francisco location might not look as nice or have the same character and charm of this place but that’s the trade-off we have to make if we want a space we can afford.”“Besides” he added “for what we’re paying here we can probably get a place that’s newer and way less cramped.”At press time a piece of paper reading “Thank You For 239 Great Years!” had been taped up on each of San Francisco’s city limits signs.

With how hard the nation is struggling to perform even basic functions letting it meet its end naturally is the merciful decision here.”“We just need to remember all the good times we had. Like the moon landing—that was really nice wasn’t it?”Added Martin: “At the end of the day it’s nearly 240 years old—what can you reasonably expect?”Others agreed with Martin saying that with America having gradually become a weak almost unrecognizable shadow of its former self the priority now should be ensuring that it is given whatever palliative support it needs and using the remaining time to put the nation’s affairs in order.Sources also emphasized that citizens who have not already begun to emotionally prepare themselves for the country’s demise should begin to do so.“At a time like this it’s completely understandable to wish for some kind of 11th-hour miracle but expecting the U.S. to somehow magically return to the way it was in its prime isn’t healthy or realistic” said Georgetown University researcher Andrew Fischer who later stressed that just because the nation still has “the occasional good day” this should not cause anyone to get their hopes up for a sudden recovery. “It’s important to manage expectations and realize that sometime very soon we’re all going to have to say goodbye.”“We just need to remember all the good times we had” Fischer continued. “Like the moon landing—that was really nice wasn’t it?”Many of those with close ties to the United States said they were having difficulty coming to terms with the country’s imminent passing but that letting it go peacefully was ultimately for the best.“At one point I would’ve done anything if it meant having America around for just a little longer but I can’t watch it slowly waste away like this anymore” said Tampa FL resident Kathy Muniz adding that it “breaks [her] heart” when she sees how hard the U.S. struggles to put on a brave face and pretend that everything is fine. “The kindest thing now is to just do what we can to keep the nation’s spirits up while nature takes its course.”“Really I think any country in America’s position would want the same” Muniz added.
2015-06-02T12:05:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/parents-worried-children-old-enough-to-remember-family-1819577846,Parents Worried Children Old Enough To Remember Family Vacation,YOUNGSTOWN OH—Fearing that their kids’ impressions of the experience could quite possibly remain with them for the rest of their lives parents Joel and Bethany Weyandt told reporters Tuesday they are worried their children are old enough to remember the details of their recent family vacation.The husband and wife said their son Michael 6 and daughter Nora 5 have both reached an age at which they are capable of forming and retaining distinct memories stoking the couple’s concerns that the kids will be able to recall numerous details of their trip to Hershey PA from the oppressive heat to the numerous barbs the parents uttered at one another to the hours spent waiting in various lines.“It’s sad to think that the kids are probably going to remember everything we went through on this trip—the tiny little hotel room Michael’s ear infection all of it” said Bethany noting in particular a heated exchange between her and her husband that occurred after he missed an exit on Interstate 80 as well as the 30 minutes of tense silence in the car that followed the argument both of which she believed might now be part of her children’s lifelong store of memories. “If Nora and Michael were still toddlers we probably would have been in the clear. But they’re too old now so there’s really no hope that the closed pool and the broken A/C at the hotel aren’t going to leave a lasting impression on them.”“There are too many moments that I just know are going to stick with them like how bored they were on the Gettysburg battlefield tour—they hated every second of that.”“Unfortunately it’s likely all going to be stuff they never forget” she added. “Even that lunch we had at Cracker Barrel when everyone was overtired.”The series of regrettably memorable vacation episodes reportedly began with a reservation error at the Comfort Inn forcing the family to spend much of the first afternoon of their vacation waiting in the facility’s lobby while the problem was resolved which subsequently limited them to just a brief half hour visit to Hershey’s Chocolate World before they were forced to leave at closing.Moreover the couple noted that there was little chance their children would forget that their father spent most every morning taking business calls during which he would require the whole family to stay quiet. Additionally the fact that the family had nothing to do but watch Night At The Museum on their iPad in their room for three straight afternoons due to a series of heavy thunderstorms would according to the Weyandts likely remain among their children’s strongest associations with the vacation.“There are too many moments that I just know are going to stick with them like how bored they were on the Gettysburg battlefield tour—they hated every second of that” Joel told reporters noting that even when he asked Nora if she wanted to get a popsicle after enduring the daylong excursion his daughter simply replied that she wanted to go back to the hotel a “probable sign” that the memory had been formed and was there to stay. “Even if they look back on this trip and the only thing they remember is the sunburn they got during our visit to the zoo that’s going to be bad enough.”“I want to believe that this is going to end up like our trip a couple of years ago when we all caught a stomach bug when we visited St. Louis—there’s no way they remember any of that” he continued. “But I don’t think we’re going to be so lucky this time around.”While the Weyandts expressed confidence that their children would be able to look back on certain moments with fondness such as the round of mini-golf they played at a local family fun center the pair confirmed that such positive memories would almost certainly be overshadowed by the chaos that resulted when Michael got separated from the others at Hersheypark and spent 15 minutes crying in the amusement park’s visitor center until security reunited him with his panicked family members. The parents added that this episode along with a later emotional meltdown when Michael was scared by the height of the Ferris Wheel would almost certainly be the first things their son recalled when thinking about the vacation in the future.The couple further acknowledged their extreme fear that these events would perhaps be among the first thoughts their son and daughter would call to mind when thinking back upon their childhoods in general.“You always hope that something like this doesn’t register but the fact of the matter is that they’re both going to remember every detail of when Nora got carsick on the drive home and we had to pull over and clean her up with a handful of napkins from the glove compartment” Bethany said. “And sadly that’s something we’re just going to have to accept.”“At least when we drive to Tampa to visit Grandma this Christmas they’ll be used to this kind of thing” she added.
2015-05-29T08:24:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/scientists-make-unclear-breakthrough-after-giving-robot-1819577830,Scientists Make Unclear Breakthrough After Giving Robot Cancer,STANFORD CA—Theorizing that their work most likely represents a groundbreaking scientific achievement of some kind researchers at Stanford University announced Thursday that they have made an unclear breakthrough by giving a robot cancer.The team of oncologists and mechanical engineers told reporters that after years of research and repeated trials they had finally succeeded in causing an aggressive form of advanced cancer to spread throughout a laboratory robot’s mechanized arm and central processing unit noting that this landmark accomplishment probably has beneficial implications for the scientific community or society at large “or something like that.”“Right now what we can absolutely say for sure is that this robot has Stage IV cancer and only has two to three months left until it succumbs to the disease.”“Diagnostic testing has confirmed that our robot has developed a high concentration of malignancies throughout its entire structural framework which for all we know could turn out to be incredibly important to science” said lead researcher Amos Cruise noting that the degenerative disease is corroding the machine’s circuitry at a rapid rate a development that he stated might potentially lead to further advancements in cancer research or robotics or maybe electrical engineering. “Never before has cancer been detected in a non-biological entity which seems like a pretty big achievement to me. I mean it took three years of experimentation just to get cancer to take hold inside a robot and anything that requires that much effort probably ends up being pretty useful I imagine.”“Right now what we can absolutely say for sure is that this robot has Stage IV cancer and only has two to three months left until it succumbs to the disease” Cruise added. “That alone has got to be some sort of leap forward in our understanding of terminal illnesses. Right?”According to Cruise after introducing cancerous neoplasms into the robot’s microprocessors the disease eventually metastasized from its motherboard to its sensor modules and chassis an unprecedented expansion that researchers said had never been observed before and therefore would have to be categorized as a success in some sense. Just six weeks later the Stanford team reported that the disease had completely disabled the robot’s optical and pneumatic systems in a progression that several of the project’s top epidemiologists haltingly called a watershed moment in “whatever scientific discipline covers this sort of thing.”Additionally sources confirmed that the rapidly proliferating disease had degraded the integrity of the unit’s electrical wiring by 70 percent with Cruise asserting that while such a development didn’t immediately suggest any practical applications for cancer treatment it certainly seemed like something worth noting.He added that initial tests have revealed that the robot’s cancer is inoperable which he stressed was probably a pretty meaningful detail as well.“We’ve begun administering an aggressive course of chemotherapy drugs and are putting the robot through daily radiotherapy sessions to see how it responds to the treatment because we figured you know that seemed like a pretty logical thing to do at this point” said Cruise noting that while the robot’s condition continues to decline monitoring its reaction to concentrated doses of toxic radiation “might be one of those things that pays off somewhere down the line.” “Meanwhile we’re also applying for additional funding in order to someday replicate our findings in other robots by giving them cancer and maybe some other diseases too. That’s the type of thing we usually do during projects like this so I guess we’ll try that and see how it goes. Can’t hurt.”“Maybe if we can build a robot that already has cancer it could…” he added before trailing off.When reached for further comment Stanford’s research team confirmed that in what just has to be a crucial finding for artificial intelligence or possibly a related field they have determined that the robot is fully aware it has cancer and is in constant pain.
2015-05-28T10:34:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/olay-getting-women-to-drop-guard-with-few-nonjudgmental-1819577834,Olay Getting Women To Drop Guard With Few Nonjudgmental Ads Before Nailing Them With Body Shame,CINCINNATI—Laying out a new marketing strategy to reach customers and promote their brand skin care giant Olay announced plans Thursday to run just enough nonjudgmental ads to get women to let their guard down before it absolutely nails them with body shame.At a press conference company executives rolled out a number of body-positive advertisements for Olay’s age-defying anti-wrinkle day lotion eye-awakening cream micro-sculpting serum and other products saying they hoped to lure women in and then right when they’re least expecting it bombard them with an all-out barrage of magazine spreads and primetime TV spots that promote shockingly unattainable standards of beauty.“We’ll lull them into a false sense of security by throwing an affirming message or two their way starting with our new tagline: ‘Embrace you’” said Olay marketing director Devin Salazar who told reporters the goal was to get as many women as possible to leave themselves wide open for what comes next. “And as soon as they start to feel comfortable in their own skin we’ll let loose a nonstop flood of ads featuring the photo-retouched faces of models so young they don’t even need our products. Women won’t even know what hit them.”“When an 18-year-old with a perfect complexion holds up a tube of our anti-aging eye roller on television and says ‘Are you ready for your close-up?’ it’s game over” he continued. “We’ve got them right where we want them.”According to company sources Olay plans to “reel them in” first with a campaign of billboards web videos and banner ads that feature a curvy average-looking woman dancing in her underwear along with positive slogans about loving yourself and accepting your body the way it is which officials hope will convince women to temporarily buy into the message that one’s physical appearance isn’t what’s important in life.Approximately a month later when marketing professionals believe the first wave of ads will have made enough women feel sufficiently vulnerable a second wave will reportedly introduce a new tagline—“Who says you can’t stay young forever?”—and deliver a hefty dose of shame about having crow’s feet laugh lines or even one single visible pore anywhere on your face.Sources confirmed Olay will also unleash a variety of dermatological terms on customers like “hyperpigmentation” in order to keep them apprised of cosmetic defects they didn’t even know they had.“The moment they begin to embrace their imperfections and finally see themselves as strong beautiful human beings—that’s when we’ll line up the crosshairs” said Salazar describing plans to deploy a series of supermodels to suggest to customers that they’re somehow inadequate as women if they don’t use various chemical exfoliants and detoxifying scrubs to fight the natural aging process every step of the way. “Then all of a sudden—bam!—we tell them they’ll never be happy if their skin begins to sag or they have any blemish of any kind.”“We hit them real hard with that quick one-two and they’ll definitely be extra critical the next time they look in the mirror” he added. “Then we just sit back and let women’s negative images of their bodies take over. Easy as that.”Olay executives said they also plan to launch a social media campaign using the hashtag #allbodiesarebeautiful which the company anticipates will raise women’s self-esteem just enough so that it can “really knock them on their asses” with an ad in which women are warned that they are not fit to be seen in public wearing a swimsuit if they haven’t been applying a firming body lotion.“Sure we could probably just slam them with the body shame immediately but it’s way more effective to do something that makes them feel good about themselves earn their trust and then really clobber them with the unrealistic expectations” Salazar said. “Once we get them to bully themselves they’re ours for the long haul. Plus we can build them up and tear them down as often as we want. We could temporarily switch back to an empowering ad campaign just to soften them up again before we take another crack at them.”“And we can keep doing this over and over and over again” he continued. “Look we’re a $2 billion brand—who’s going to stop us?”Salazar assured reporters that both phases of the advertising strategy would be effective in getting women to spend more money on skin creams.

According to reports Lauer was fully aware that there were powerful people involved in concealing which apps are capable of getting kids interested in science and that any misstep could endanger his source’s career.Crafty Mom reportedly first contacted the longtime Today Show host in 2012 when Lauer received a call from an unlisted phone number and a husky voice on the other end simply uttered the words “safe strollers” before explaining that if the TV personality wanted to learn more then the two should meet near the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal.“You think you’re the only one trying to figure out how to get kids to love playing outside? I’m sticking my neck out for you. You got that?”According to reports the latest clandestine encounter occurred at exactly 2:03 a.m. Thursday when the informant handed Lauer a manila folder which was said to contain the cutest baby-naming trends plans for managing children’s screen time and tips for capturing an infant’s first year with monthly growth photos.“This birth collage stuff goes way deeper than you know” said Crafty Mom who is rumored to be the source that directed Lauer to use found objects to spell out a baby’s name for a birth announcement. “This is big Lauer. The American public needs to hear about this.”“You can photograph a clock to show the exact time of birth” added the source obscuring her face behind a tall collar. “That’s all I’ll say.”After evading Lauer’s specific questions about tub toys and washable markers the source reportedly informed the morning show host that he had “all the pieces to blow the lid right off getting your kid to take a bath.”Sources confirmed Lauer has leaned heavily on his anonymous informant in recent months relying on her to confirm his suspicions about organic gluten-free puff cereal and new potty-training techniques. Lauer reportedly divulged that Crafty Mom “knew attachment parenting was going to be big before anyone had even heard of co-sleeping.”“I hope you know what you’re getting yourself into” said the source who reportedly told Lauer that if even one tip for setting up your own newborn photoshoot fell into the wrong hands he would need to find a new informant. “You think you’re the only one trying to figure out how to get kids to love playing outside? I’m sticking my neck out for you. You got that?”According to sources Lauer was last seen being closely tailed by a Dodge Caravan on his way home from the secret rendezvous.

Military officials confirmed that the state-of-the-art drones have already flown hundreds of covert condolence missions in an effort to convey the U.S. government’s official regrets to those mourning the death of innocents caught in the midst of American combat operations.“The Griever represents the future of warfare damage control” said U.S. Air Force general Mitchell Holt who explained that standard operating procedures now call for the immediate deployment of a condolence drone upon determining that a prior Reaper drone attack resulted in the accidental death of one or more noncombatants. “This unit is equipped with the most sophisticated commiseration technology available and with it we can swiftly and efficiently deliver our deepest sympathies to those who have lost a friend or family member in an erroneous or inaccurate drone strike.”“From our command center in Nevada we possess the tactical capability to project compassion anywhere in the world” he added.Following the inadvertent killing or maiming of an innocent civilian Pentagon officials said that it often only takes hours sometimes even minutes for a Griever drone to reach either the site of the bombing or if reliable intelligence is available the resulting funeral proceedings. Defense Department sources confirmed that the unmanned aerial vehicle which is painted in a somber all-black finish will then maintain a holding pattern 30000 feet above the ground while relying on a combination of infrared cameras and motion sensors to identify the distinctive movements of the hysterically weeping next of kin.“With the Griever we can pay our respects to dozens of survivors in a single fly-by.”After confirming the sorrowful individual’s identity with reasonable certainty the drone will then engage the mourner strafing his or her location with hundreds of sympathy cards before circling back and shelling the target zone with its 1500-kilogram payload of precision laser-guided gift baskets. The drone reportedly also possesses eight high-powered loudspeakers which broadcast a series of pre-recorded messages indicating that the deceased is now in a better place and that their family members will henceforth be in the U.S. government’s thoughts and prayers.Sources confirmed that the Griever’s highly advanced onboard computing systems allow it to declare tender reassurances with pinpoint accuracy having proven capable of isolating a sobbing widow within a crowd of sympathizers and unleashing a barrage of comforting words to the appropriate residence hospital or mosque during her time of need.“Simply put these drones provide the safest and most efficient means of expressing contrition in an active combat zone” said Holt adding that the After Action Reports from condolence operations indicate that the military’s expressions of pity reach the intended party in 87 percent of cases. “Normally unfavorable conditions on the ground would limit our consolatory efforts in these regions to administering slow arduous door-to-door emotional support but with the Griever we can pay our respects to dozens of survivors in a single fly-by.”“The condolence drones have proven especially effective in Yemen and Somalia where we have been deploying them dozens of times per week” he added. “We expect them to continue to be a central component of our campaigns there going forward.”When reached for comment men women and children throughout the Middle East confirmed the increasing presence of the Grievers telling reporters that the faint empathetic murmur emitted by the drones as they pass overhead has become an inescapable aspect of life in a war zone.“Shortly after Ahmed was killed we were preparing his body for burial when we heard a second drone flying above us” said Afghan farmer Sayed Noyan referring to his brother who was caught in the blast radius of a Hellfire missile strike while walking near the home of a suspected Taliban operative. “I remember there was a loud echoing voice intoning that Ahmed was a good man and that he would always be remembered. That’s when everything went black.”“The next thing I know I come to on the floor and realize that the roof was destroyed and our living room was littered with dozens of floral bouquets and scented candles” he continued.At press time the Pentagon had issued a formal apology for an incident last month in which a Griever accidentally consoled two Western hostages.
2015-05-14T11:10:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/report-white-house-officials-deliberately-hid-fdr-s-me-1819577862,Report: White House Officials Deliberately Hid FDR’s Mechanical Spider Legs From Public,NEW HAVEN CT—Shedding new light on one of the most influential leaders in American history Yale University historians released a report Thursday that suggests White House officials deliberately hid President Franklin Roosevelt’s mechanical spider legs from the public.The report which draws upon a recently discovered trove of photographs state documents and personal journals describes a coordinated effort by top aides to conceal the fact that the 32nd president relied on a set of eight hydraulically powered cast-iron legs to skitter about during the last two decades of his life.“Roosevelt’s advisers feared voters of the time would never elect a man whose lower extremities had been replaced with an intricate system of spider-like appendages” said report co-author Stephen Elmore who noted that during FDR’s first campaign for governor of New York his staff began to disguise the 4-foot-long triple-jointed prostheses that he had custom-designed to regain mobility after becoming paralyzed in 1921. “After he secured the White House they continued to worry about the potentially devastating fallout should his eight lanky motorized legs be discovered by political opponents or foreign governments.”“Records show that even some members of his Cabinet were unaware Roosevelt was a robotic arachnid below the waist” Elmore added.According to historians the president’s entourage blocked views of his wide base of spindly metal legs by closely flanking him on all sides until he was safely behind a desk a table or one of his specially crafted 6-foot-wide podiums. If he needed to be seen seated they reportedly covered his legs with blankets or pillows as was the case at the 1945 Yalta Conference when assistants draped 11 wool shawls over his lap before he posed with Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin.The president is said to have cherished getaways to his personal estate in Hyde Park where he was free to scutter around the grounds without fear of being spotted.Various written accounts reveal that when driving him to public events Roosevelt’s chauffeurs always parked his Lincoln convertible in hidden garages so no one could glimpse him exiting the vehicle a noisy process that required him to extend his long clanking alloyed limbs out the limousine’s door one at a time until he could crawl out onto the pavement.While most reporters kept the president’s condition off the record Secret Service documents show that agents often confiscated the film of noncompliant photographers. Historians discovered one set of images in which Roosevelt his hands occupied with the adjustment of his bow tie can be seen standing on his two hindmost legs and using each of his remaining legs to sign six different executive orders simultaneously.“There are several clues that in retrospect support the idea that FDR made use of a mechanical contraption consisting of four pairs of symmetrical limbs that emerged from beneath his torso” said Elmore noting that the occasional faint hissing of the president’s leg pistons is audible in several of his fireside chats. “In the recording of 1943’s ‘On The Coal Crisis’ one can even hear beneath his familiar patrician tones what is most likely the sound of Roosevelt lubricating a squeaky ball bearing in his knee joint as he argues that it is the United Mine Workers’ patriotic duty to end their strike.”“We also believe the mysterious rhythmic banging heard during his ‘Infamy’ speech is the sound of at least three of his heavy iron feet tapping nervously on the floor” he added.Unearthed blueprints indicate many renovations were made to the White House during FDR’s administration including widened doorways and a titanium-reinforced bed frame to support the extra 400 pounds of his specialized extremities. In addition financial records confirm Roosevelt retained a full-time staff of machinists and metalworkers to handle repairs and keep him moving around during his more than 12 years in office.Because the concealment of his condition took an enormous emotional toll the president is said to have cherished getaways to his personal estate in Hyde Park where he was free to scutter around the grounds without fear of being spotted. It was there records suggest that he sought refuge during the most trying days of the Great Depression clambering up the wall to a ceiling corner of his study to devise his outlines for projects such as the Civilian Conservation Corps and Tennessee Valley Authority.“It’s important to remember that in those days the need to rely on eight mechanical spider legs was perceived as a weakness” said Elmore citing a lack of education about the issue and the fact that most Americans simply chose not to talk about it. “For him it was a matter of political survival. Of course in today’s media environment it would be nearly impossible for a president to disguise a set of large molded metal appendages.”“Fortunately our views are more progressive now” he continued. “For example in the current presidential race no one considers Sen. Ted Cruz’s razor-sharp tungsten fire-ant mandibles to be a disadvantage.”

Many escapees leave medical centers on the hook for up to $30000 in damages which begin to mount the moment fleeing patients rip the electrodes off their chest and further accrue as they carelessly knock over their IV pole in their frenzy to run off frequently spilling costly intravenous medication all over the floor.“Aside from the equipment costs many hospitals must pay workers’ compensation claims due to the physical injuries that staff members suffer when a patient on the run suddenly wheels a gurney into their path to impede their pursuit” Umbdenstock said. “And if the escapee beats them to a waiting elevator they are often hurt again when running at full speed they slam into doors that close just in the nick of time.”“And this is to say nothing of the $185 million hospitals pay every year in added heating costs when doctors arrive to a room only to find an empty bed where the patient used to be and a wide-open window with the curtains billowing in the breeze” he added.The report discovered that the drain on resources further extends to white lab coats and stethoscopes which are said to be frequently donned by fleeing patients who avoid pursuers by ducking into open supply closets emerging moments later in garb that often allows them to pass as health care professionals.Moreover records suggest the nation’s hospitals are forced to pay an additional $8.6 billion in malpractice lawsuits each year when these individuals enter directly into an operating theater by accident where because their identity has been obscured by a stolen surgical mask they are mistaken for a scrub nurse and asked to hand instruments to a surgeon performing an appendectomy.“Of course these costs all double when patients escape in pairs with one posing as a doctor and pushing the other in a wheelchair” Umbdenstock said. “That’s twice the clothing we have to replace. But fortunately for hospitals’ finances the wheelchair is almost always recovered when an orderly in pursuit of the fleeing duo later finds it toppled on its side in the parking lot with one wheel still spinning.”

Senior officials noted that their goal of keeping NASA’s facilities open for the next 30 years would test the very limits of their skill and ingenuity explaining that the undertaking would likely surpass the Voyager missions and manned spaceflight in terms of technical difficulty.“Though the scope of the Fortuna Program is far greater than anything we’ve ever attempted I’m certain that through the right combination of hard work perseverance and a little bit of luck NASA can make it all the way to 2045” said the agency’s administrator Charles Bolden who emphasized that the plan would require cutting-edge innovation and spectacular administrative feats to arrive at the lofty objective. “With so many great minds devoted to this project we have a chance at achieving something that once seemed like the stuff of fiction.”“It may seem impossible now but we hope to realize the vision of establishing a human presence in NASA deeper into the century than ever before imagined” Bolden added.When questioned about the plan’s viability Bolden told reporters that while certain doubts remain the project was nonetheless an absolutely crucial undertaking for NASA. Bolden further emphasized that the Fortuna Program’s goal was technically achievable on paper and could feasibly be accomplished in a real-world scenario so long as everything “goes perfectly” for the space agency.“The first critical step toward reaching our goal is to still be here by the year 2020” said Bolden adding that the plan allowed absolutely no room for error. “From there we will move on to the next phase of the mission which is to implement an intensive 10-year plan to remain operational. If we meet that goal in 2030 then there’s no reason to believe NASA won’t make it to 2045.”“As long as each stage succeeds and we keep hitting our yearly milestones of being a functioning agency we will eventually get there” Bolden continued. “This mission if successfully completed has the potential to be one of mankind’s greatest achievements greater even than the Hubble Telescope the International Space Station and putting a man on the moon.”Bolden who confirmed that all of the agency’s personnel and resources would be focused solely on the project explained that the Fortuna Program represented the very future of NASA.“We may not be around to reap the benefits of the Fortuna Program but the next generation will be” said Bolden noting that the plan was rife with logistical challenges and unknowns that would have to be dealt with as they emerge. “Though the risks are great we will continue to build upon what we’ve learned during our 56-year history to reach our objective at any cost.”“Today marks the beginning of a new chapter for NASA” Bolden added. “Whether we succeed or fail I believe that the outcome of this mission will define the American space program for years to come.”

In addition sources said that a windowless unlit reading room will display hundreds of pages of shredded correspondence and personal testimonials that may or may not have been relevant to the event in question.The museum will also reportedly host screenings of an exclusive documentary consisting of three out-of-context seconds of an interview with an unnamed physician before cutting to a 75-minute montage of Fourth of July parades and still images of servicemen raising the American flag.Lanney said that visitors will be able to purchase an audio guide for the exhibit which will play snippets of barely discernible narration in a language other than that which was requested. Guided tours in which docents lead guests directly from the ticket counter to the museum’s exit will also reportedly be available to museum visitors.“Visitors can learn everything they need to know about Tuskegee and its legacy—which is essentially nothing—from this exhibit” senior curator Bethany Osgood told reporters. “When patrons are hurried out the doors before our closing hours of 10:15 a.m. they will have gleaned the only facts that they need to know about this matter which are that it occurred a long time ago and that there really isn’t much more to say on the subject.”“No more questions” Osgood added.According to officials the museum was founded by prominent historical revisionist Henry Fleming who in 1968 donated his private collection of burned government papers concerning the relocation of Japanese Americans during World War II. Since its unannounced opening the gallery has featured such exhibits as a retrospective of the construction of the First Transcontinental Railroad consisting solely of a toy electric train that circled around a locked box containing records of laborers’ working conditions as well as a room devoted to the Trail of Tears that contained no doorways by which to enter.Officials predicted that the Tuskegee exhibit may prove to be among the museum’s most impressive entirely whitewashed attractions. In fact several museum patrons told reporters that the new exhibit had provided them the unique opportunity to superficially engage with what they had no reason to doubt was the nation’s past.“Between viewing a completely bare wing that was about something called the Middle Passage and the exhibit on My Lai that had handwritten pages taped over its plaques explaining how the mission was a civilian outreach initiative to help Vietnamese citizens I had a great time today” visitor Leslie Shields said. “I also really enjoyed the exhibit on the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki which turned out to be a single giant mural depicting the Founding Fathers signing the Declaration of Independence with ‘America The Beautiful’ playing in the background.” “I learned so much” she continued. “I’ve never felt more proud of my country.”

I shudder to think what kind of damage they cause when they walk out of here and attempt to interact with civilized society.”“But a penitentiary is exactly where these types of people belong” he added. “Can you imagine these guys out patrolling the streets?”

They will bask in the splendors of vegetables once derided as ‘taters’ and ‘spuds.’ Ladies and gentlemen we stand on the threshold of a shining triumphant potato-filled tomorrow.”“Right here right now is the dawn of the potato age” he added. “In our produce aisles a brilliant transformation is afoot.”Sources within the nation’s foremost agricultural circles confirmed there had long been murmurs of a coming pomme de terre époque a new awakening across the country that would signal a shift in the way Americans think about potatoes. They cited advances in cultivation packaging shipment and storage as bellwethers of the modern era of potato enlightenment a period in which all people will according to Lake “revel in the glories of the potato.”At the conference Lake evoked with great satisfaction the reimagined world of potatoes his generation would be able to hand to the next—one brimming with vast fields of impeccable Kennebecs Austrian Crescents and Purple Majesties—yet he emphasized that the immense tuberous achievements we enjoy today were by no means inevitable.“The 1970s through the mid-’80s were dark times for the potato as most of us here remember all too well” said Lake recalling the benighted attitudes toward Russet Burbanks and fingerlings he had been subjected to as a young man. “Many questioned whether we would ever recover. To all the naysayers who turned their backs on potatoes to them I say ‘Look at potatoes now. Look at the Adirondack Red the Elba the Colorado Rose the German Butterball!’”“When the chronicle of our age is written the potato will be on page one” Lake continued. “The forthcoming generations will grow up knowing only a world in which potatoes stand exalted and supreme. They will bask in the splendors of vegetables once derided as ‘taters’ and ‘spuds.’ Ladies and gentlemen we stand on the threshold of a shining triumphant potato-filled tomorrow.”While encouraging potato growers to take pride in ushering in this unprecedented potato resurgence Lake cautioned against falling victim to excessive hubris and urged the industry not to rest on its laurels.“Let us not forget the lessons of history: The superiority of the green bean went unquestioned for decades and we all know what happened to it” he said. “It is critical that we never take this golden age for granted because there but for the grace of God go potatoes.”
2015-04-30T12:44:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/aerospace-engineers-warn-first-grader-s-design-for-spac-1819577761,Aerospace Engineers Warn First-Grader’s Design For Spaceship Completely Unsafe,MONROEVILLE PA—Listing off a litany of structural and technological flaws the nation’s leading aerospace engineers issued a stern warning Thursday that local 6-year-old Bradley Koenig’s design for a spaceship is entirely unsafe.Experts from the fields of aerodynamics jet propulsion and control engineering unanimously confirmed that the orange-and-purple rocket ship which Koenig drew during Mrs. Silvestri’s first-grade class not only raises major safety concerns but could compromise the lives of everyone on board were it to ever go to launch.“I can’t even begin to enumerate all the safety protocols and fundamental principles of spaceflight that this particular vehicle violates” said veteran NASA flight director Raymond Fletcher who called the crayon-drawn spaceship the “most poorly conceived” and “shockingly hazardous” craft he had ever encountered. “The asymmetrical oval shape of the craft alone would likely cause it to break apart upon reentry into Earth’s atmosphere. That’s assuming the long row of randomly spaced circular windows are properly coated with a heat-resistant material to ensure they don’t disintegrate before reaching space in the first place.”“Bradley’s mockup ignores even the most basic laws of thermodynamics” Fletcher continued. “This ship is essentially just a deathtrap.”Fletcher who estimated that the spacecraft would cost in excess of $230 billion given the wide array of elaborate instruments affixed to the exterior said that the vehicle’s protruding robot arm which he noted with alarm was more than twice the length of the ship certainly would not be deployed during takeoff and would not be holding a large sword as depicted.Engineers also said that the ship’s apparent lack of oxygen generators high-temperature insulation tiles vertical stabilizers doors of any kind and an air pressurization system would significantly endanger the lives of the two smiling stick-figure crew members—distinctly labeled with blue arrows and large capital lettering as Koenig and his best friend Joshua.“Bradley’s mockup ignores even the most basic laws of thermodynamics. This ship is essentially just a deathtrap.”“First of all the astronauts are not secured by any seat belts or straps—there aren’t even seats to begin with—meaning that they would be thrown about the cabin immediately upon liftoff” said former space shuttle Endeavour commander Christopher Ferguson who noted that even if the seemingly rudimentary boosters could generate enough thrust to reach orbit there appeared to be no coolant system to prevent the intense 5000-degree temperatures of fuel burns from vaporizing the entire craft. “In addition the large glass dome surrounding the cockpit would shatter almost instantly from the intense atmospheric pressure of reaching escape velocity. They won’t be playing on a basketball hoop on the flight deck when that happens I assure you of that. They would be propelled out of the module and suffocate within seconds.”“I would not even consider piloting such a craft without extensive safety modifications” Ferguson added.Ferguson also said that the two variously sized wings mounted to either side of the spacecraft would compromise its flight trajectory sending it careening dramatically off course during launch. He further explained that the cockpit’s steering wheel would be virtually useless in such a situation.“We must have run at least 200 3D computer simulations and there is simply no scenario in which the periscope doesn’t at some point break off and rip an enormous hole in the command module” said Paulo Lozano director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Space Propulsion Lab. “And unless Bradley has discovered a new form of liquid propellant I’m unaware of it’s fairly obvious that with so many flames shooting from the engine the fuel supply would be depleted within a matter of hours leaving the craft immobilized and left to float off forever in the void of space.”“And needless to say navigating any manned ship so close to a giant speeding asteroid is also unbelievably dangerous” Lozano added.Despite the clear and irrefutable problems in Koenig’s design experts did admit that the ship’s giant laser cannon for shooting space monsters was the most awesome thing they had ever seen.

It’ll feel good to sit back and unwind without any distractions.”According to sources with knowledge of the man’s addled state of delirium Farragut then guided his cursor to the drop-down menu that contained the computer’s shut-down command. After he clicked the option on his touchpad the computer reportedly gave the wildly senile individual the chance to come to his senses by asking if he was sure he actually wanted to turn the machine off.However by willfully avoiding the “Cancel” button and clicking “Shut Down” the demented madman left no doubt that powering down the computer was in fact his intent.“Maybe I’ll get back into that book I started reading a couple weeks ago” Farragut told reporters while folding down the screen of his laptop and placing the device on a side table actions that brought into stark relief just how untethered from the real world he had become. “Or maybe I’ll check out the new ESPN magazine I got in the mail today.”“It will be nice to just take it easy for the rest of the night” added the man lost in an illusory world of his own hallucination. “Then I’ll call it a day and head to bed.”At press time Farragut remembered there was something he needed to check on real quick.

Based on their findings researchers hypothesize that death is handed down through individual lineages becoming a devastating family curse that is passed from parent to child and which tends not to skip a generation.In addition a separate study of some 8000 individuals who died in the Hartford CT area found that every one of the deceased had ancestors who had died before them further suggesting a family link.While people from afflicted lineages can reportedly prolong their lives by developing healthy habits such as a nutritious diet and regular exercise researchers stated that in the end no matter how many precautions they take their genetic susceptibility to dying will win out.“We recommend alerting your doctor if there’s a history of death in your family and if you aren’t certain you should ask your parents if they know of any fatalities among your relatives” Booth said. “This is also important information to know before deciding to have children yourself. Even if your own family is alive and well it’s possible there is death somewhere in your partner’s ancestry.”“If you have a grandparent or even a great-grandparent who has died then sadly the odds of your kids eventually dying are quite high” she added.When reached for comment several of the study’s participants acknowledged they had at least one deceased family member and expressed their fear and concern to reporters.“I feel perfectly healthy now but knowing that my father died definitely makes me worry that the same thing could happen to me one day” said Randy Lewis a 49-year-old who took part in the study. “But my mom is still alive so I’m keeping my fingers crossed that I take after her side of the family.”Added Lewis “Unfortunately I can only wait and see.”

If you show up on time with your shirt buttoned you’re already doing far better than most everyone else.”“Seriously of all the people applying for all the available positions in the country right now only about 50 or so actually have any idea what they’re doing” Perez continued. “Those are the ones you’re really competing with. The rest are pretty much all dipshits.”According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics these clueless dopes can be found among candidates for every entry-level managerial and executive position throughout the public and private sectors. Recent data indicate that eight in 10 people interviewing for any given job reportedly spend the entire time staring blankly at the prospective employer their mouth hanging open as they nod or shake their head in response to questions.For every qualified applicant to a given job the bureau’s statisticians found there are 37 dummies who fail to meet even one requirement for the position 28 who can’t write a simple cover letter without sounding totally illiterate and 15 who have to call multiple times on their way to the interview because they keep getting lost.Data suggest only a handful of American job seekers can make it through a 10-minute phone interview without gibbering like a brainless halfwit who has no idea what time of the day it is or why anyone has called them in the first place.“If you can attach a résumé to an email you’re already in the 90th percentile of applicants in the U.S. workforce” said Stacey Hines a human resources executive at General Electric citing the number of thick-witted job seekers who forget to include the document with their message and then immediately send a harried follow-up email in which they fail to send it once more. “Half of these things we throw in the trash immediately because some total dumbass has spelled the contact person’s name three different ways.”Hines who has spent more than three decades as a hiring manager for major companies told reporters that it is rare to find a candidate who can form a halfway-coherent sentence that communicates a point and doesn’t trail off into a list of mumbled office jargon or stop abruptly for no apparent reason.“As long as you’re not some slack-jawed pea brain who shows up with barbecue sauce smeared along the corner of your mouth and the first words out of your mouth aren’t ‘How soon can I get paid?’ you’ll probably do just fine” she said. “Just this morning I had five big old dumbfucks outside my office who each thought they had an appointment at 9 a.m. so I interviewed all of them together just to get them out of the way.”Labor economists confirmed the real problem facing unemployed Americans is the staggering number of giant assholes out there since they’re the ones who always wind up getting the best-paying jobs.
2015-04-14T08:18:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/new-evidence-suggests-middle-east-conflict-predates-all-1819577694,New Evidence Suggests Middle East Conflict Predates All Human Civilization,NEW YORK—In a major breakthrough that provides new insight into the region’s deep-seated instability researchers at Columbia University presented evidence Tuesday that indicates the long-running conflict currently engulfing the Middle East predates all human civilization.According to the team of leading historians archaeologists and paleontologists the regional turmoil appears to have originated long before the Sunni-Shiite rift of the seventh century or even the first proto-urban settlements in Mesopotamia some 11000 years earlier with data suggesting that the violent struggle has been raging across the same 5-million-square-mile area since the dawn of life on earth.“In our efforts to trace the underlying origins of the Middle East conflict we found that the brutal hostilities started almost 4 billion years earlier than we previously thought” said lead researcher Anthony Jackson who added that the conflict could now be linked back to savage guerrilla attacks launched by the first single-celled organisms to emerge in what would later be known as Jordan. “Eons before there were Israelis or Palestinians in the region—or anyone else for that matter—fighting broke out at the microbial level with the unusually fierce clashes soon spreading into what is now Iraq Iran the Arabian Peninsula Egypt and Turkey. Of course it was just a barren featureless landscape covered by a prehistoric sea at that point but nevertheless unrest was highly concentrated in this area.”“While the recent bloodshed in Syria is horrific it has yet to reach the intense level of carnage wrought by giant land-dwelling theropods during the Cretaceous period.”“This discovery allows us to put developments from the Holocene epoch of the past 12000 years—the Arab Spring uprisings the 1982 Lebanon invasion the Yom Kippur War and so on—into a much fuller context” he continued. “We can now say that today’s fighting in Syria and Iraq is simply a continuation of the battles waged in the primordial soup of the Precambrian age.”Based on an analysis of the fossil record scholars have determined that the Middle East conflict includes a vast array of violent events spanning more than four-fifths of the earth’s history including a mid-Paleozoic massacre that wiped out nearly all millipedes on the Gondwana supercontinent a vicious marine life territory dispute during the Silurian period that left millions of organisms floating dead in the bitterly contested waters above present-day Yemen the Iranian Revolution of 1979 and a key battle fought 700000 years ago in the Golan Heights by members of the species Homo erectus who had just discovered fire.Jackson explained that the conflict escalated dramatically when Pleistocene megafauna first occupied what is now the land around Jerusalem. For hundreds of millennia according to the researcher control shifted back and forth between woolly mammoths and giant rhinoceroses each of which reportedly sought to eradicate the other species entirely and establish a permanent homeland in the region.“While the recent bloodshed in Syria is horrific it has yet to reach the intense level of carnage wrought by giant land-dwelling theropods during the Cretaceous period” said Jackson citing fossils unearthed in Saudi Arabia that reveal these dinosaurs helped destabilize the entire region with ferocious large-scale attacks often against members of their own species. “The ruthless nature of daily life in the region and perpetual threat of deadly violence displaced millions of parasaurolophus and triceratops driving them hundreds of miles from their natural habitats and leaving them to forage for food and shelter in totally unfamiliar terrain. It was pure chaos.”“However there have been a small handful of peaceful lulls in the region—most notably in the first six months following the 2008 Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement and during the 215 million years of the Cryogenian ice ages when the earth was blanketed in thick continental glaciers” he added. “But these periods of relative calm offered only temporary respite.”Since the beginning of prehistory Jackson estimated more than 50 trillion innocent and defenseless organisms from every known phylum have been bitten stung trampled or clawed to death in the area of Gaza alone. Nonetheless he expressed optimism that the Middle East will one day be free of violence.“Of course finding a viable solution will be difficult given the incredibly complex geopolitical sectarian historic prehistoric and evolutionary factors contributing to the unrest” Jackson explained. “That said there is still hope that a lasting peace in the region will eventually be achieved once the sun burns out in about 5 billion years.”

2015-04-02T11:13:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/engineers-unveil-new-driverless-car-capable-of-committi-1819577657,Engineers Unveil New Driverless Car Capable Of Committing Hit-And-Run,PLANO TX—Describing the prototype as a major technological breakthrough for autonomous vehicles engineers at Toyota unveiled the first driverless car Thursday capable of committing a hit-and-run.Members of the design team told reporters that the innovative autonomous car which relies on a system of sensors and sophisticated algorithms to provide it with a split-second reaction after being involved in a collision has successfully demonstrated the capacity to immediately flee the scene of an accident to avoid legal repercussions without any human intervention.“With this step forward we are closer than ever to having road-ready self-driving cars that are proficient at assessing vehicular damage analyzing surroundings and performing complex maneuvers to effectively dodge responsibility after clipping another automobile” said head engineer Stephen Graham adding that throughout numerous crash tests on a closed course the driverless car perfectly executed evasive actions to frantically peel away before observers could record the license plate number. “Very soon there could be a fleet of self-driving cars specifically designed to eliminate the possibility of human error when making a break for it following a fender bender.”“Taking your hands off the wheel and allowing your car to respond to an accident by squealing out of the area as fast as possible is the future of automotive transport” Graham continued.“The day it finally left a huge dent in the side panel of another vehicle and just tore out of the parking lot in under three seconds that’s when we knew we were onto something.”According to engineers the driverless car features an advanced Culpability-Evasion System which rapidly utilizes front side and rear-mounted cameras to determine whether the other vehicle involved in the collision sustained any visible scrapes or dents and survey the area for eyewitnesses. Technicians confirmed that the self-driving vehicle’s onboard computer calculates within several microseconds of the crash if its own actions are to blame and if it finds it is at fault it then initiates a strategy to floor it and speed onto a major roadway before the police arrive.Saying the vehicle’s automated hit-and-run ability represented the culmination of years of effort Toyota sources explained that the car had experienced a number of setbacks in early development including its repeated failure to desert the scene of even small dings scratches and rear-end impacts.“Our earliest tests involved closely controlled scenarios such as having the driverless car back into a parked minivan but they always failed immediately when the vehicle would mistakenly put on its hazard lights and wait for the other driver to return” said computer programmer Claire Durmont adding that they eventually tweaked the algorithms so the vehicle would immediately drive off after colliding with another automobile or with a stationary object such as a pole or mailbox. “The day it finally left a huge dent in the side panel of another vehicle and just tore out of the parking lot in under three seconds that’s when we knew we were onto something.”“Now it has the ability to put some distance between itself and the crash site by driving for 25 straight miles in any direction before it finally pulls over into a fast food place parking spot to gather its composure” continued Durmont.Although those involved with the project admitted that the car’s hit-and-run abilities are still rudimentary they stressed that once the autonomous system is fine-tuned future models will be capable of far outperforming humans in escaping any and all responsibility for an accident.“This vehicle’s onboard computer can instantaneously make judgment calls like whether that nick in the sports car it just struck was already there with an incredible level of accuracy” said David Conroy an automotive consultant on the project. “Autonomous cars are all about making life easier for the vehicle’s occupants. And by using real-time satellite imagery and up-to-the-second traffic data to flee the scene of an accident far faster than any human driver could our self-driving vehicle will remove any chance of having to deal with costly traffic citations insurance rate hikes or the irate owner of the damaged vehicle taking all the hassle out of driving.”Added Conroy “This is what driving should be.”Hoping to build on their initial success Toyota engineers confirmed they were very close to programing the self-driving car to aggressively pursue an asshole motorist who cuts it off in traffic.

Unfortunately though we have no way of extracting it.”“Our own country has enough water in its Vanilla Coke Zero to fill Lake Michigan but in its current state that water is useless to us” he added.“By harnessing the freshwater that exists inside these remarkably abundant beverages we could more than double access to safe drinking sources worldwide.”Researchers confirmed the 7.2 million cubic kilometers of water confined within Coca-Cola beverages are unsuitable for most personal and household purposes because they are too compromised by various chemicals and acidic compounds. While scientists have attempted for years to distill quality drinking water from samples of Powerade and Full Throttle energy drinks no one has successfully purified these or any other Coke products of the ingredients contaminating their valuable H20 molecules.In a landmark 1995 study a team of hydrologists at the University of Arizona is said to have successfully removed the carbonation from original-formula Coca-Cola Classic by opening a can of the beverage and leaving it out overnight but experts confirmed that since that time little progress has been made in removing the visible impurities from the product.“By harnessing the freshwater that exists inside these remarkably abundant beverages we could more than double access to safe drinking sources worldwide” said Ghosh observing that soft drinks manufactured by Coca-Cola are present all across the globe even in places where lakes rivers and aquifers have run dry. “We’re devoting all the resources we can toward developing an adequate filtration process that can turn Cherry Coke and Fresca into clean drinking water but we have a long way to go.”“So far our best attempts at filtering Coca-Cola have only left us with the same brown strong-smelling liquid that can under no circumstances be used to sustain life” he continued.The new report indicates that Coca-Cola reserves are especially plentiful in North America where they exist in thousands of 64-ounce reservoirs that can be found at points along major roadways and within population centers. Additionally researchers discovered that in South America nearly 30 percent of freshwater is locked up in orange Fanta while 26 percent of clean water in Japan has been rendered completely inaccessible inside green-tea-flavored Coke.In an examination of the ongoing drought in California the report concludes that if it can one day be tapped the potable water contained within the supply of Sprite in Los Angeles alone will meet the needs of the entire state for years to come.The call for investment in Coke-filtration technologies is perhaps strongest in developing nations where populations awash in the cola often face shortages of clean water. Yasinta Kusila a Tanzania resident and mother of three told reporters she walks 10 miles each day past numerous containers filled with Coke to obtain the water she needs for cooking and to ensure her family has enough to drink.“Water here is scarce but everywhere you look there’s Coca-Cola” Kusila said. “It’s so demoralizing to know that there is good clean water in there but there’s no way to get it out. Do you have any idea what that’s like for a mother just trying to provide for her children?”“It’s so close and there’s so very much of it” she added “but what good does it do anyone?”

It’s about time I headed to some new city where I can start over with a totally blank slate and instantly stumble backward into the same self-defeating behaviors that will ultimately leave me in an indistinguishable pitiful situation within months.”“I’ve gotten so used to being unfulfilled here that sometimes I forget there’s a whole wide world out there where I could be equally depressed and joyless.”“I don’t know where I’m going to fritter away the next stage of my life just like I’ve wasted the previous two decades but I know it can’t be here” he continued.Forlano told reporters that he hopes to leave behind the drudgery of his present lifestyle by taking to the open road with no destination in mind and driving until he finds another town where he feels he can put down new roots continue making no effort to improve himself and never pursue his passions. The unmarried administrative assistant added that he often spends his time daydreaming about making the move to a far-flung location where he would be surrounded by entirely new people with whom he could reassume his dispiriting series of disappointing OkCupid dates and brief dysfunctional relationships.Explaining how he believed he needed to “really shake things up” Forlano emphasized that the time had come for him to get out of Florida and slip into a virtually identical pattern of ordering takeout from one of three nearby restaurants and spending his ample downtime watching reruns of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit in an entirely different state.“I’ve gotten so used to being unfulfilled here that sometimes I forget there’s a whole wide world out there where I could be equally depressed and joyless” said Forlano adding that he has begun asking himself what’s stopping him from being just as miserable in Atlanta Nashville or even San Francisco. “There are so many amazing places that I’ve never been to before and I feel I owe it to myself to take advantage of some new opportunities to experience the crushing professional stagnation and perpetual self-loathing I’ve always felt.”“Honestly at this point I might just throw a dart at a map and go be a useless fuckup wherever it lands” he added.At press time Forlano had reportedly reconsidered his choice committing himself to digging even deeper into his rut in his hometown for the foreseeable future.

It’s the only other one we have.”In anticipation of the lengthy policy battles that lie ahead the conservationists have collected 100000 signatures on a petition calling for a ban on strip mining in the picturesque Tartarus Montes a practice they reportedly fear would generate air pollutants that could despoil the planet’s 96 percent carbon dioxide atmosphere.Reports indicate that the group is even in discussions with several sympathetic celebrities including Cate Blanchett and musician Jack Johnson who may be interested in serving as the face of a campaign encouraging people to “Keep the Cydonia Mesa beautiful.”“There is potentially water below the surface of Mars in which case it’s only a matter of time before it becomes contaminated” said Wright who then described an ongoing lobbying effort to establish purity standards for any fresh streams that may eventually spring from the planet’s rock glaciers. “If there’s drinkable water trapped in the planet’s permafrost we must conserve it because once it’s gone it’s gone.”“We know it won’t be easy but someone needs to step up and fight for this planet” she added. “It’s the only other one we have.”Activist leaders told reporters that within the year they also hope to propose several health codes that will prohibit the dumping of hazardous materials into the planet’s underground lava tubes and clean up much of the existing industrial and electronic waste that has already accumulated on the Martian surface.“Of course we want to do more than just save the immaculate vistas and rich topography of Mars and that’s why we’re directing the bulk of our resources toward defending the natural habitats of whatever microbial life could in theory be there” Wright said. “We’ve already identified several possible sites for a 40000-acre nature preserve within the Cebrenia quadrangle in order to protect any potential biospheres in the area should they exist.”She added “Hopefully if we can get the ball rolling now we’ll be able to ensure that a robust Martian wilderness will thrive for many generations to come.”Sources from the Redder Tomorrow Foundation confirmed that it has had no problem raising funds now that most donors to conservationist causes have realized their efforts on Earth are a lost cause.

It’s exasperating.”In addition to perennially mortifying expenditures like tanning salon fees and the minimum payment on teaser-rate credit cards the country’s currency complained that the rise of the online economy has given the American populace countless new ways to debase it including the crowdfunding of everything from pointless new apps to completely unqualified individuals’ attempts at making indie pop albums short-form documentaries or other misguided creative projects.“I should be making a down payment on a house or helping somebody go to college not paying for cross-country airfare so some moron can go to Bonnaroo.”U.S. dollars are reportedly even more humiliated when they are converted from actual cash into digital credits that can only be used within a single mobile game world to buy entirely fictional items like virtual pigs or lollipop hammers.On the rare occasion when people actually choose to save it up the nation’s money stated it’s almost always so they can make appalling purchases on an even larger scale perhaps buying a luxury SUV they can’t actually afford or an expensive new electronic device to replace the nearly identical but slightly older device they already own.“I should be making a down payment on a house or helping somebody go to college not paying for cross-country airfare so some moron can go to Bonnaroo” said another portion of money explaining how it can barely go a month anymore without being used to book a party bus. “Back when I was a business loan I used to hope that maybe someday I’d be the seed capital for the world’s next big tech startup or even just a respectable family store but instead they loaned me out to a guy who just opened his neighborhood’s fifth vape shop.”“Thinking about it still makes me feel filthy” the money added.The nation’s currency also expressed dismay at having to constantly cycle through the same series of frivolous and dispiriting transactions over and over again. One sum of money has reportedly been trapped within a one-block radius of a Camden NJ check-cashing business for the past 16 years and another sum in Reno NV is believed to have spent its entire existence rotating between the roulette tables at a run-down casino and the cash register of a nearby pawn shop.“Last week once again I ended up in the pocket of one of these shitheads who goes around promising people they can make $10000 a month from home allowing them to quit their job and set their own schedule if they just put down a little money up front” a collection of banknotes said. “I try not to get too depressed about stuff like that but given the choice I think I’d rather have never been minted than have to live with the disgust of paying for one more elective cosmetic surgery or inflatable holiday lawn decoration.”“Worst of all every two years a couple billion of us get thrown away on another election that doesn’t change a goddamn thing” the money continued. “I might as well not exist.”
2015-03-20T08:54:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/study-not-many-disco-songs-about-daytime-1819577607,Study: Not Many Disco Songs About Daytime,NEW YORK—In perhaps the most comprehensive analysis yet of the genre’s lyrical content a Columbia University study published Friday found that very few disco songs have been written about daytime.The survey which encompassed every known disco album or single released from 1973 through 1980 determined that the once-popular dance music celebrated the night the nightlife and boogieing till the break of day far more frequently than it did the hours between sunrise and sunset.“We found extensive evidence of disco behaviors starting in the evening peaking around midnight and continuing until the sun comes up but virtually no indication that such activities were ever engaged in beyond that point” said lead author and musicologist Christopher Choy adding that even the most passionate disco vocals stopped short of urging people to dance past dawn. “As far as we can tell the hours of 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. hold almost no interest whatsoever for the average disco diva or anyone else connected to that style of music.”“In fact there wasn’t a single track that endorsed letting the groove take control while it was still light outside” Choy added.For the study researchers cross-referenced the lyrics of thousands of disco hits—particularly key phrases such as “got to give it up” “burnin’ up the dance floor” and “disco trance”—with various times of day. While their work uncovered many intersections between common disco phenomena and nighttime researchers told reporters that none of the songs exhorted listeners to get down to the new dance craze during normal business hours.“We searched the entire Bee Gees catalogue as well as Andy Gibb’s three studio albums to see if we could find any mentions of typical daytime activities such as going to the bank or being stuck in rush-hour traffic but there was nothing” said researcher Gina Young. “Likewise we couldn’t find any reference to mowing the lawn from Donna Summer Chic or KC and the Sunshine Band.”“We did discover a small number of songs that defied the overall trend by mixing traditional disco themes with daytime imagery but these were largely unsatisfactory.”“Put another way if it’s 9 a.m. it’s very unlikely anyone’s offering to take you higher and higher” added Young.According to the researchers the range of time with which the majority of disco songs is concerned can also be narrowed down further by the fact that the musical events portrayed typically take place not on regular weeknights but during the late hours of Friday and Saturday a period that reportedly accounted for virtually every call to boogie-oogie-oogie.“We did discover a small number of songs that defied the overall trend by mixing traditional disco themes with daytime imagery but these were largely unsatisfactory” said researcher Todd Levy. “Rose Royce’s ‘Car Wash’ implies a daytime setting but there’s no solid evidence its lyrical content is concerned with anything other than the pros and cons of being employed at that particular establishment while Thelma Houston’s ‘Saturday Night Sunday Morning’ merely uses the day as a framing device for discussing the disco seduction that took place entirely during the previous night.”“And while we can safely infer that half the hours in Barbara Pennington’s ‘Twenty-Four Hours A Day’ occur during the daytime no one can disco-dance that long which suggests the song is purely a hyperbolic exercise and in no way explicitly daytime-themed” continued Levy.At press time the researchers said their follow-up study would attempt to catalogue how many disco songs concerned relaxing at home as suggested by references to playing board games and kicking back on the porch.
2015-03-18T13:27:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/study-finds-majority-of-deaths-caused-by-failure-to-hee-1819577602,Study Finds Majority Of Deaths Caused By Failure To Heed Omens,GENEVA—Explaining that simply identifying the phenomena can significantly reduce the risk of early mortality the World Health Organization released a study Wednesday revealing that the vast majority of deaths worldwide are caused by a failure to heed omens.Researchers who analyzed worldwide mortality data from 1980 to 2014 reportedly discovered that disregarding ominous signs portentous dreams and other harbingers of darkness accounted for over 38 million deaths each year. According to the study failing to take notice of prophetic signs of one’s end was the largest contributing factor to fatalities in every geographic region and socioeconomic demographic.“We’ve found that as many as 95 percent of people who’ve witnessed dark portents could have survived if they had taken the simple step of paying attention to the forewarnings of their impending doom and acted accordingly” said WHO coordinator for public health Dr. Alex Kazberouk while presenting images of spilled salt a white moth attempting to enter a home six crows and other commonly dismissed omens. “Prompt recognition of a presage is crucial. Individuals can greatly increase their life expectancy by responding with prayers and sacrifices or exposing the source of the omen to strip away its power.”“Unfortunately regardless of age sex or race those who clearly see signs of their looming demise often neglect to take basic precautions such as wearing a necklace of amber or carrying an acorn” Kazberouk added.“If we’ve learned anything from our analysis of global mortality statistics it’s that as soon as a wizened old hag visits your doorstep in the dead of night you need to immediately kill and bury a bird then recite a hymn over a goblet filled with polished pebbles.”An analysis of health records revealed that of the 2.5 million individuals who died in the United States last year a full 50 percent reportedly saw a woman in white a raven with a broken neck in the middle of a footpath or other augury at some point in their lives. In addition roughly a quarter of the deceased had reportedly dreamed about multiple moons drowning in mud or a thorny tree sprouting from their heart yet took no preventative action upon waking.WHO officials told reporters that properly identifying a portent of death and immediately visiting a local shaman dramatically reduced the impact of omens especially if individuals combined the practice with regularly ringing a bell to ward off evil spirits.The study also confirmed that even after experiencing an unmistakable and foreboding premonition such as an owl appearing in the daylight nine out of every 10 people failed to carry out even the most routine measures to subdue the unhallowed forces surrounding them by burning a tin of sage and sweetgrass in the center of a room in which they eat and drink.“If we’ve learned anything from our analysis of global mortality statistics it’s that as soon as a wizened old hag visits your doorstep in the dead of night you need to immediately kill and bury a bird then recite a hymn over a goblet filled with polished pebbles” National Institute of Health director Francis Collins told reporters adding that younger men in particular shouldn’t take their safety for granted if the crone suddenly disappears into the fog of night. “In the morning go back and sprinkle smoldering ashes on the bird’s gravesite then stomp three times with bare feet to vanquish fire with flesh.” “Everyone sees the omens but how you react will make all the difference” Collins added. “You can live a long healthy life in the presence of these omens if you just take the necessary steps and incant the names of the four directions every day.”Researchers were careful to note that as with all studies on mortality there are notable exceptions to the rules such as the rare case of a 104-year-old Japanese woman who has dreamed of her skin peeling away every year since 1950 yet has refused to rub a brown egg on her body. The health experts warned that in the vast majority of cases however individuals who fail to heed the dire signs of ruination are essentially writing their own death sentences.“Above all people need to know that early detection is the key to preventing omen-foretold deaths” said researcher John Oakey of Washington University at St. Louis noting that teenagers should begin purifying their bodies upon the first sign of hearing horse hooves where no such beast exists. “In the meantime the best we can do is continue to fund research educate the public and remind people to seek help as soon as they see a phantom dog with fire-red eyes.”

And at exactly 6 p.m. he’ll open the door a crack.”“Just let yourself in quietly and change into the silk négligée he’s left on the nightstand” she continued. “Mr. Belzer will signal to you when he’s ready.”According to sources after using her phone to show her younger coworker several recent photographs of the actor Pierson laid out a set of strict guidelines to ensure a successful evening. These reportedly included not asking any questions about Belzer’s family life film career or 1997 HBO comedy special and never discussing rates since he “always pays in full ahead of time.”The older escort then reportedly drew from personal experience to convey Belzer’s requirement that any girl in his company apply a particular shade of English Rose lipstick and two sprays of Chanel No. 5—no more no less—which he typically sets up beforehand on the bathroom vanity.“Look I remember how nervous I was when Mr. Belzer and I had our first session but I know you’re going to do great.”“Sometimes Mr. Belzer will want you to stay the night and you just have to do it. You’ll be compensated of course” said Pierson adding that the actor’s desire to extend the visit would become evident if he nuzzled up beside Grant and gently stroked her hair. “Basically if he gets what he wants he’s very tender. Don’t worry; there’s never been any funny business and he won’t rough you up.”“But if he calls you Louise just go with it” Pierson continued. “Once a few years ago I asked what he meant and he just got dressed and walked out. That’s a mistake you don’t want to repeat.”Over the course of the conversation sources confirmed that the older escort repeatedly stressed to her less experienced colleague that Belzer’s time was highly valuable detailing an occasion in 1991 around the time he first gained national fame when one call girl’s reluctance to remove a piercing had prompted him to refuse payment and storm off back to the set of the television series The Flash.However Pierson reportedly suggested that if Grant played her cards right and politely acquiesced to his “very reasonable” sexual demands she could one day join the elite cadre of escorts favored by the 2008 People’s Choice Award nominee.“Look I remember how nervous I was when Mr. Belzer and I had our first session but I know you’re going to do great” said Pierson noting that the actor would certainly be infatuated with Grant due to his predilection for thicker thighs. “Just remember that he’s pretty well-known and when he asks for something—whether it’s just holding you and looking into your eyes for the whole session or sending you to the tub so he can watch you bathe—he’s going to get it.”“All I’m saying is don’t go into this thinking it’ll be easy” she added. “You can’t just push him around the way you would with Sam Waterston.”

Will Cut Into His Business,WASHINGTON—Claiming that his operation would be “completely dicked over” by an influx of product Vice President Joe Biden reportedly became increasingly worried this week that the recent legalization of marijuana in Washington D.C. could seriously cut into his business.Biden who White House sources confirmed had significantly increased his annual marijuana sales after swiping a state-of-the-art hydroponics unit from a gardening supplies store back in 2012 expressed frustration at the possibility that legalizing the drug would wreak havoc on all of his investments.“Aw Christ now everyone will be growing their own herb” said a visibly upset Biden adding that he was “raking it in” before D.C. voters approved “that horseshit” Marijuana Legalization Initiative in a ballot measure last November. “Don’t get me wrong Uncle Joe is slinging the dankest nugs in town. But who’s going to call me up for an eighth of Purple Trainwreck if they can just grab some buds from their own homegrown stash?”“Sure as shit no one’s hauling ass all the way to the Lincoln Memorial to meet up with me to score some cheeba anymore” the vice president continued.Biden stressed that his business had recently been running as “smooth as Tennessee trim” becoming especially lucrative after he brought on his buddy Blaze to strong-arm a couple “rough and tumble” hombres who were muscling in on his turf.“You can ask anyone on the Hill and they’ll tell you Uncle Joe is always good for a fat sack. I never short or skimp anyone. And my shit is never all seeds and stems like the bunk ditch weed that Mikulski hawks.”The vice president was reportedly distraught over potentially losing his bread-and-butter customers in Georgetown noting that students and professors bought a ton of Blackberry Kush. Indicating that drastic measures might be necessary to prevent his whole operation from going belly-up Biden suggested that he would have to start peddling “doobage” in Baltimore at least five times a week.“Listen I don’t trust the government but legalization is gonna cost me a huge chunk of change” said the six-term Delaware senator adding that all the marijuana seized by DEA agents goes straight into their own pipes. “And Ol’ Joe’s baby needs new red vinyl seats. Some stains last forever if you catch my drift.”According to longtime aides the new law has the potential to be the largest setback to Biden’s marijuana enterprise since the vice president suspected First Lady Michelle Obama of “eating cheese to the Secret Service” in 2009 forcing the 72-year-old to uproot a potent strain of Sour Diesel growing in a neglected corner of the Rose Garden.“Dynamite Joe had a nice little thing going for himself and it’d be a damn shame for some stupid law to come along and fuck up the good times” said Biden who reportedly asked White House aides if President Obama could pull a few strings and make legalized cannabis go away. “You can ask anyone on the Hill and they’ll tell you Uncle Joe is always good for a fat sack. I never short or skimp anyone. And my shit is never all seeds and stems like the bunk ditch weed that Mikulski hawks.”“Fucker’s bags are always light” added Biden. “And that cheap-ass stuff just crashes you out.”Despite the obstacles that marijuana legalization will present Biden remained confident that his quarter pound of magic mushrooms would still bring in “serious green” for the foreseeable future.

2015-03-10T10:06:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/report-whites-more-likely-to-be-named-ceos-than-equall-1819577569,Report: Whites More Likely To Be Named CEOs Than Equally Sociopathic Black Candidates,ALEXANDRIA VA—Shedding light on the striking lack of diversity within the highest ranks of corporate America a report from the Executive Leadership Council released Tuesday reveals that white individuals are far more likely to be named CEOs than equally sociopathic black candidates.Despite widespread evidence that minority executives are just as misanthropic and unprincipled as their Caucasian peers the study found that less than 1 percent of Fortune 500 companies have black chief executives demonstrating that the upper levels of the business world frequently remain inaccessible to even the most morally bankrupt of African-Americans.“Our data shows that when white megalomaniacs and black megalomaniacs contend for the highest corporate positions in the U.S. the latter are routinely passed over” said the report’s lead author Sandra Norwood pointing to dozens of recent instances in which African-American individuals who had proven track records of undermining their colleagues’ employees’ and shareholders’ interests in order to further their own selfish ambitions were not even offered an interview for a company’s top seat. “Vindictive unscrupulous blacks simply aren’t granted these leadership opportunities despite possessing the same willingness to maximize short-term profit by eliminating health insurance benefits for part-time employees or commit accounting fraud in order to inflate the value of their personal stock options.”“These are heartless sadists who have put in countless hours of backstabbing and forsaken all ethical constraints in order to bolster their own power and yet time and time again they are denied a place at the top of the corporate ladder simply because of the color of their skin” she continued.According to the report even when companies were presented with numerous highly qualified minority candidates with no moral compass and a history of increasing earnings by knowingly rushing an unsafe product to market or outsourcing thousands of manufacturing jobs to overseas sweatshops the top-tier positions still tended to be awarded almost exclusively to deceitful empathy-devoid whites.In fact the study found that when presented with identical résumés of potential CEOs who had hid billions of dollars of revenue in offshore tax havens and poached several engineers from a rival business in order to illegally gain confidential trade secrets—one labeled with a common Caucasian name and the other with a traditionally African-American name—boards of directors were far more likely to select the applicant with the white-sounding name. Such findings suggest that many at the highest corporate level still hold inherent biases against amoral power-hungry egotists of color.“When you’re black you have to be twice as ruthless and deceptive just to reach the senior level but then you can pretty much forget about ever having a shot at the corner office.”“Even in 2015 many corporate boards will automatically discount a black candidate even if they have demonstrated that they are fully capable of using aggressive intimidation tactics to prevent their company’s workers from forming a labor union” Norwood said. “Board members often are more comfortable working with lying underhanded double-crossers who are similar to themselves. Therefore the individual that they ultimately promote to CEO tends to come from the same cultural background that turned them into destructive unrepentant monsters.”According to sources the dearth of black CEOs within corporate America has prompted a number of companies to institute personnel outreach programs to identify and cultivate malevolent young African-Americans who they believe have the potential to one day violate insider trading laws and initiate spurious patent lawsuits against smaller competitors in order to overwhelm them with legal fees and force them out of the industry.However after years of confronting the “glass ceiling” that prevents them from advancing as far as their white peers many blindly ambitious blacks told reporters they are skeptical that these programs will have a meaningful impact on African-Americans who aspire to become CEOs so that they can immediately downsize as many low-level personnel as necessary to hit profit targets that trigger lucrative personal bonuses.“When you’re black you have to be twice as ruthless and deceptive just to reach the senior level but then you can pretty much forget about ever having a shot at the corner office” said William Coleman the sole African-American vice president at a prominent Wall Street financial services group who says he has yet to be recognized for allocating the risk of his firm’s portfolio of unstable derivatives investments entirely onto the municipal worker pension funds it administers. “My company just elected a white external candidate for our CEO role even after I successfully shifted the blame for a botched merger onto a fellow senior manager before personally firing him and claiming his successes as my own. It’s like they refuse to see how deeply predatory and full of hatred I am.”“My race shouldn’t be a factor when I’ve proven that I’m a borderline psychopath who will step over anybody in my way to sate my fanatical lust for power” he continued. “When it comes to succeeding in the business world that’s all that should matter.”

Most of them didn’t even have a proper altar to stand on.”“The idea of consecrating the Eucharist at a big-time cathedral was just a pipe dream back then” he added. “I was lucky if I could get a single person to make the sign of the cross at the end of my blessings.”“I had one set of vestments that I’d end up wearing for a week straight. Of course back then I was also living with five other priests in a three-bedroom apartment. Those were wild times.”Pope Francis told reporters that of the few followers who sat in those dark dingy houses of worship most appeared totally disinterested in his homilies oftentimes sitting in total silence while he attempted to preach the virtues of charity and piety and exhort believers to seek everlasting life in Christ. The pontiff noted however that many of the parishioners were justifiably underwhelmed as he was still developing his liturgical voice at the time. Indeed Francis added that he gets pretty embarrassed now when he thinks back on some of his “terrible” early material on the Holy Trinity and the Kingdom of God.Recalling his early struggles the Vicar of Christ admitted he was living mass to mass for several years. According to Francis shortly after he started attempting to shepherd the faithful in 1969 he gave himself a five-year deadline to either become the pastor of his own parish or pack it in and get a real job.“I certainly wasn’t making much—half the time they’d just give me some leftover communion bread and a glass of wine” said Francis. “I had one set of vestments that I’d end up wearing for a week straight. Of course back then I was also living with five other priests in a three-bedroom apartment. Those were wild times.”“We were just a bunch of young guys trying to make it as worthy conduits of the Lord’s eternal word” he continued.The Bishop of Rome and Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church added that while he is glad he no longer has to stand on the street coaxing passersby into his service he definitely misses the wilder days when he stayed out well past midnight mass most nights and got completely intoxicated on God’s love.
2015-03-05T09:53:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/frustrated-nation-calls-for-updated-zip-line-infrastruc-1819577555,Frustrated Nation Calls For Updated Zip-Line Infrastructure,WASHINGTON—Offering vocal criticism of the aging transit network and its continued failure to meet their transportation needs frustrated citizens nationwide are calling upon federal officials this week to at long last update the country’s obsolete zip-line infrastructure.Advocates for reform whose demands have grown louder in recent years have assailed America’s decades-old system of ladders poles platforms and galvanized steel rope as inadequate arguing that the current infrastructure provides limited and inconvenient options for low-altitude carabiner-and-cable-based travel across the United States.“As it stands our current zip-line infrastructure must be rebuilt from the ground up if zip-lining is to remain viable for the millions of workers students and business travelers who rely on it every day” American Public Transportation Association president Michael Melaniphy told reporters. “Right now if someone wants to travel by zip-line they must crowd into long lines and wait for extended periods before riding along a patchwork of rusty cables and end posts many of which haven’t been refurbished since they were first erected in the 1950s. Frankly the fact that we’re still commuting on the same zip-line technology our grandparents used is embarrassing for a nation as advanced as ours.”“We can and must do better than this” Melaniphy continued. “Ideally anyone should be able to throw on a helmet and a pair of close-toed shoes take a deep breath and let gravity zip them away to their home or place of business without having to walk miles to their nearest launch platform or face interminable delays due to antiquated lines’ weight limits.”According to several recent surveys the public’s frustration stems largely from the aerial transit system’s failure to accommodate the growing number of harnessed and strapped-in travelers. Additionally transportation experts cite the network’s degrading cable clamps frequent maintenance-related delays and multipage liability waivers as further reasons why the nation’s zip-line network must be updated.“All I want is a simple hassle-free transit system that will let me soar above the tree canopy to the places I need to go and maybe also a camera to snap my picture as I stick out my tongue and flash a ‘hang loose’ sign while I’m at it.”As part of their calls for modernization travelers have also demanded such innovations as greater inclines for faster zips high-capacity cables that can send hundreds of passengers sailing through the air at the same time and zip-lines with grippable T-bars that come to an abrupt halt mid-line causing riders to lose their handhold and plunge into bodies of water below.“Every morning when I clip myself to the cable before work I know I’m going to be standing up there on the platform forever just waiting for my turn” said Oakland CA resident Matthew Marshall adding that even after he leaps off he too often finds himself stuck dangling in place when his zip-line sags. “If they could just put in one direct high-speed zip-line across the bay so that I could quickly get between here and my job in San Francisco it would make my life so much easier and shave hours off my zip-line commute each day.”“Unfortunately installing new zip-lines between major cities seems to be our elected officials’ lowest priority” he added.Experts claim that failing to modernize the nationwide zip-line grid is likely to have a number of negative and costly repercussions beyond simply inconveniencing the millions who currently use the gravity-propelled transit system as their primary form of transit. In particular environmental watchdog groups have warned that the lack of fast reliable zip-lines will inevitably lead millions to turn to such fuel-intensive modes of transportation as dune buggies hovercraft and zeppelin-share programs.A number of independent reports published in recent years have recommended that the U.S. take cues from the extensive zip-line infrastructure in Europe where citizens regularly swoop from city to city while gliding beneath a five-eighths-inch steel wire.“All you have to do is look at all the people zipping through the air above France and Germany to realize just how far behind we are” said Cincinnati resident Marsha Adams referring to the comprehensive network of ultrafast zip-lines that have been carrying passengers between London Paris Stockholm and thousands of other locations across the continent since the early 1980s. “It’s the 21st century for God’s sake. All I want is a simple hassle-free transit system that will let me soar above the tree canopy to the places I need to go and maybe also a camera to snap my picture as I stick out my tongue and flash a ‘hang loose’ sign while I’m at it.”“Honestly though with the way things are now it usually makes more sense to just fork over the extra cash and strap on a wingsuit” she added.

But that also means we don’t see overfiltered photos of food truck tacos or videos of high school students asking celebrities to accompany them to prom and we never will.”“Truth be told I can live with that” he continued.According to a nationwide poll 73 percent of China’s population favors the government’s policy of blocking certain words and images it considers subversive from appearing in citizens’ search engine results noting that the banned material could potentially include any number of meme photographs featuring user-generated text or listicles of ugly holiday sweaters.An additional 85 percent of respondents voiced their support of the Communist Party’s efforts to curtail access to most social media sites explaining that while such regulations could be considered overly broad and heavy-handed this censorship at least ensures citizens don’t ever log into their online account to find numerous invitations to play Bubble Witch Saga.Furthermore a full 98 percent of the Chinese people stated that the Golden Shield Project firewall that blacks out a significant portion of web content originating from outside China “isn’t all that bad” as it effectively filters out all television show recaps online poker games crowdfunding campaigns for friends’ indie long-form documentary projects Twitter and racially charged discussion threads beneath webcam videos sports articles and billions of other pieces of online content.“I really don’t want any of those capabilities if it would mean I’d regularly have to sit through a 30-second laundry detergent commercial in order to watch some office’s poorly filmed parody of Pharrell’s ‘Happy’ music video.”“Our government scrubs the internet of everything it considers remotely objectionable and when I stop to really consider what that means I’m perfectly fine with it” said Shenzhen resident Bao Ling whose online activity is heavily monitored by her nation’s cybersecurity analysts and who has not once been invited by a microwave popcorn company’s pop-up ad to “join the conversation” about their brand. “Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to have unrestricted use of email and be able to read a pro-democracy blog without one of our state-controlled internet service providers immediately taking it offline. But that would also mean sifting through countless spam messages advertising work-from-home opportunities and navigating vast scrollable catalogues of celebrity nip slips. That’s not a trade-off I want to make.”Additionally numerous citizens expressed their gratitude that Chinese authorities systematically prevent them from accessing Western news websites noting that the same media outlets that might reference the Tiananmen Square massacre or the recent protests in Hong Kong would likely also include in-depth coverage of the latest viral wedding proposal video and mid-level celebrities’ recent style makeovers.In fact many of the Chinese citizens surveyed expressed sympathy for people in other countries who were exposed to the entirety of the internet without constraint particularly the residents of the United States and other Western nations who must routinely contend with 3000-word thinkpieces about superhero movies blurry concert footage recorded on a cell phone and online comments consisting largely of the phrase “butthurt” on a daily basis.“When you consider what full access to the internet would really entail we’re actually sort of lucky that our government does everything possible to keep us in the dark” Bao said. “Of course having unfettered freedom of expression and the ability to utilize online resources to collaborate with others on a large scale would be incredible but I really don’t want any of those capabilities if it would mean I’d regularly have to sit through a 30-second laundry detergent commercial in order to watch some office’s poorly filmed parody of Pharrell’s ‘Happy’ music video or have a complete stranger repeatedly belittle my figure and threaten my family on an online message board. It’s just not worth it.”Added Bao “To be perfectly honest when I think about how I’d actually like to be spending my time I think the government could stand to crack down on our internet access a little more.”
2015-02-19T08:55:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/new-education-initiative-replaces-k-12-curriculum-with-1819577502,New Education Initiative Replaces K-12 Curriculum With Single Standardized Test,WASHINGTON—Citing the need to measure student achievement as its top priority the U.S. Department of Education launched a new initiative Thursday to replace the nation’s entire K-12 curriculum with a single standardized test.According to government officials the four-hour-long Universal Education Assessment will be used in every public school across the country will contain identical questions for every student based on material appropriate for kindergarten through 12th grade and will permanently take the place of more traditional methods such as classroom instruction and homework assignments.“By administering one uniform test to our nation’s 50 million students we can ensure that every child is evaluated by the exact same standard regardless of background age or grade level” said Education Secretary Arne Duncan explaining that students will be able to take the test at any time between age 5 and 18. “It’s absolutely crucial for us to know where our kids stand and eliminating the teaching model will provide us with the most affordable and efficient means of measuring student proficiency.”“By doing away with the overly complex program of full-length school days and lessons stretched out over 13 academic years we can concentrate on increasing the reliability of our data and determine just how each student stacks up.” “There is no better way to ensure consistency in America’s schools” Duncan added.The new test will reportedly cover all topics formerly taught in K-12 classrooms including algebra World War I cursive penmanship pre-algebra state capitals biology letters of the alphabet environmental science civics French Newtonian mechanics parts of speech and the Cold War. Sources said students will also be expected to demonstrate their knowledge of 19th-century American pioneer life photosynthesis and telling time.“By doing away with the overly complex program of full-length school days and lessons stretched out over 13 academic years we can concentrate on increasing the reliability of our data and determine just how each student stacks up” said Patrick Herlihy an education researcher who helped design the test. “This is the best most comprehensive way yet of holding our schools accountable.”“This initiative also has the potential to help level the playing field” Herlihy continued. “Kids in Mississippi for example will have literally the exact same educational opportunities as kids in Massachusetts.”Officials confirmed the test will consist mostly of multiple-choice questions though it will also include an essay section in which students will be able to choose from one of several prompts ranging from “Describe the American system of federalism” to “If I could be any animal in the world I would be a…” to “Write a book report on Lois Lowry’s The Giver.”Jeff Escudero a 10-year-old from Winamac IN who plans to take the test and hopefully complete his primary and secondary education next month admitted to reporters that the new standardized exam was a source of stress for him.“There’s a lot riding on this” Escudero said. “Still I think I’m pretty set. I just have to learn the periodic table be able to explain what triangular trade is and remember that it goes egg larva pupa butterfly. It’ll be hard answering all those questions about Richard III and the New Deal but at least I’ve already got the numbers up to 20 totally memorized. And once I’m done with the test I won’t have to go to school anymore.”Officials said the initiative would also focus on improving teacher performance by tying teachers’ salaries to the test scores of the students they hand the assessment to.
2015-02-11T09:55:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/astronomers-discover-new-planet-that-really-makes-earth-1819577474,Astronomers Discover New Planet That Really Makes Earth Look Like Shit,WASHINGTON—Calling it an unprecedented finding that fundamentally reshapes how humankind views its place in the universe astronomers from NASA announced Wednesday the discovery of a planet that makes Earth look like absolute shit.The space agency’s researchers told the media that the recently identified planet HD 904790 b wipes the floor with Earth in every possible way pointing to the celestial body’s larger size unblemished terrestrial surface diverse and verdant landforms and abundance of natural resources all of which indicate that Earth is a festering pile of garbage in comparison.“This is a thrilling and scientifically vital discovery that has substantially furthered our understanding of how much Earth truly sucks” said lead researcher Lisa Shapiro emphasizing that Earth appears to be “straight-up dogshit” when contrasted with HD 904790 b’s exceptional terrain and climate. “Just taking into account this new planet’s flawless spherical shape not to mention its pristine atmosphere free of methane and other toxic gases reveals that our home world is pretty fucking pathetic when it comes down to it.”“HD 904790 b has an extensive ring system that dwarfs Saturn’s zero tectonic plate activity and more fresh water in just one of its massive unpolluted oceans than we have on our entire worthless shitstain of a planet” she continued. “God it makes me angry just to think of how much nicer it is there.”Situated within the Milky Way’s Cygnus constellation HD 904790 b possesses a frustratingly high number of attractive geological atmospheric and hydrological features that we poor saps living on Earth can only dream of NASA officials reported. In particular the newly discovered planet is said to contain lush flowering biomes across all of its 340 million square miles which reportedly do not include any of the barren tundras glacial ice shelves or arid deserts that contribute to Earth’s status as a lousy second-rate excuse for an inhabitable terrestrial body.Additionally the space agency confirmed that the remarkable new planet boasts a perfectly circular orbit around its star as well as a precisely aligned axial tilt that in a far cry from the piece-of-shit hurricanes and blizzards that plague Earth allows HD 904790 b to maintain a constant surface temperature of 75 degrees Fahrenheit year-round with a steady 5-mile-per-hour breeze.“There’s no way I’m going to keep exploring the galaxy if it’s just going to make me feel like a complete dipshit for ever believing that my planet was anything special.” “When you take into account everything HD 904790 b has going for it it makes you feel embarrassed to be associated with our dumb fucking world” said astronomer Gary Lopes pointing to the planet’s dozen colorful reflective moons that make Earth’s sole natural satellite look like the total joke that it is. “I used to think that the Himalayas were impressive but not after we received data showing that this new planet has thousands of towering volcanic peaks that blow Mount Everest right out of the water. It’s flat-out humiliating to have to compare our planet against that.”Noting how even the least remarkable square mile of HD 904790 b far outweighs the very best that Earth has to offer in terms of physical grandeur and mineral richness NASA scientists told reporters they’ve decided to immediately discontinue their search for any more extrasolar planets saying that it was “far too likely” that they could discover additional worlds that turn out to be a hell of a lot better than Earth.“There’s no way I’m going to keep exploring the galaxy if it’s just going to make me feel like a complete dipshit for ever believing that my planet was anything special” said astronomer Samantha Wilhelm stating that if her team discovered a planet that was even better than HD 904790 b she would “fucking kill [herself] on the spot.” “I even tried observing Neptune for a while in hopes that that gaseous sack of crap might make me feel better about being stuck on Earth but it didn’t work. I can’t get HD 904790 b out of my head—it’s ruined the goddamn Earth for me forever.”At press time NASA astronomers had calculated that it would take them approximately 300000 years to reach the new planet in a space capsule but unanimously agreed that it was worth a shot rather than “spend another day on this stupid lump of shit.”

It is expected to easily surpass all previous record holders towering over every other abuse of rights in the wealthy Middle Eastern city.“With this bold new endeavor we will create the biggest deprivation of basic human dignity the world has ever seen” said DED deputy director Jamal Al Falasi who according to reports was selected to oversee the project after successfully managing several of Dubai’s smaller violations of individuals’ freedoms. “None of the others will even come close. Once completed it will be recognized everywhere as a symbol of Dubai and everything our city stands for.”“It really is humbling to be part of an undertaking this historic in scope.”Emirati sources expressed confidence that before it is even finished Saqr Ganzeer will generate a “huge splash” in the international community easily overshadowing human rights offenses in countries like Sudan North Korea Syria China and the Democratic Republic of Congo which they said will look miniscule in comparison.International observers agreed that as soon as the project is underway Dubai’s claim to the title of world’s greatest human rights infringement will likely be measured and officially certified by several independent organizations.Bangladeshi laborer Tajuddin Rahman one of tens of thousands who was lured to the emirate for the monumental exploitation of fundamental liberties told reporters that while he knows it won’t be easy toiling for countless hours on the project he hopes his family back home will be proud of his sacrifice.“It really is humbling to be part of an undertaking this historic in scope” said Rahman who explained he’s eager to begin working on the project as he needs to start funneling all his wages to his labor contractor for the next several years to pay back the cost of funding his travel to the UAE. “It will take many years to complete so I realize I might not be around long enough to see it finished.”“I only hope that when this is done people will take notice” he added.
2015-02-04T13:10:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/pope-nervous-for-annual-performance-review-with-god-1819577443,Pope Nervous For Annual Performance Review With God,VATICAN CITY—Saying he’s appeared uneasy and distracted while delivering masses in recent days Vatican insiders reported Wednesday that His Holiness Pope Francis is “getting pretty anxious” about his upcoming annual performance review with God.Francis who is employed as Vicar of Christ Successor to the Throne of Saint Peter and Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church is required by Vatican workplace guidelines to meet at least once a year with his immediate superior God and participate in an official evaluation of his strengths and weaknesses on the job a formality of the position that by all accounts has led to a bout of nerves for the pope.“I feel like I’m doing pretty good work—I’ve prayed harder increased my total blessings over last year’s numbers—but who among us knows what He thinks?” said Francis who was seen this morning restlessly pacing across the Seconda Loggia of the Apostolic Palace and wiping his forehead with a cassock sleeve. “I’m sure I could stand to step up my shepherding of the faithful a bit. Maybe squeeze in a few more canonizations. Am I being penitent enough on a daily basis? I don’t know.”“He says it should just be a quick chat but is that a good or a bad thing?” the pope continued. “Man I just want to get this over with.”Sources within the Holy See confirmed the pontiff has spent much of the week second-guessing his job performance and asking himself whether he has been effective at managing his workload prioritizing tasks serving as the sole earthly representative of God’s will for all of humanity and setting achievable goals. Though he expressed confidence that he had done pretty well with his official papal exhortations he is said to worry that he might have “botched a homily or two” over the past 12 months.“I’m really trying to do my best and stay on His good side. He sometimes has a bit of a temper.”According to liturgical experts the pope’s employee appraisal takes place each year just before Lent and is one of only a few dates on the church calendar when a Vatican worker is called in for an actual face-to-face meeting with the Creator of Heaven and Earth. Behind the closed doors of an emptied Saint Peter’s Basilica the reigning pontiff is said to kneel before God who poses a series of standardized questions asking the pope what he enjoys most about his current role and what areas he feels he could improve upon.“I did pretty well on all my performance measures last year and He just told me to make sure I keep the lines of communication open and run papal proclamations by Him first if it’s something important” Francis said. “I feel like I’ve done that which is good but what if I haven’t met His overall expectations? It’s entirely possible He was just going easy on me last time since it was my first year on the job.”“I’m really trying to do my best and stay on His good side” the pope continued. “He sometimes has a bit of a temper.”Although God is universally known for His compassion and mercy members of the Roman Curia confirmed He can be demanding as a supervisor with some speculating that because He is infinitely perfect Himself He tends to have very high standards for others. They also said it is particularly difficult for popes during their annual employee assessments as their direct supervisor wields so much power and on top of everything else is all-knowing. Fortunately they noted He is “pretty forgiving.”“I can’t even imagine going in for a job review with God Himself with Him sitting there in His big throne evaluating your performance” said Archbishop Dominique Mamberti prefect of the Apostolic Signatura. “That’s got to be an intimidating conversation especially because you can’t hide any of the mistakes you’ve made given that He sees all. That being said Francis seriously needs to relax. He’s been doing a great job.”“He’s probably just nervous because he’s been talking to the last guy who had his job” Mamberti added. “That guy couldn’t handle it at all and ended up quitting.”

So that’s been nice.”“And I haven’t had to watch a press conference in which a homicide detective talks about how this is the worst thing he’s ever seen either” Rhodus continued. “When you look at things from that perspective they don’t seem quite so bad.”In addition to finding some reassurance in the lack of reports on people being flayed hung from meat hooks and having chunks of their flesh boiled in a pot Americans said they appreciated that no investigator has uncovered a basement walk-in freezer full of leftover human body parts and that no ongoing news stories prominently feature the phrases “grisly remains” “dismemberment” or “Craigslist horror.”“When you really think about it it’s actually kind of a miracle there isn’t a guy out there right now killing random people and turning them into quilts or something.”Members of the traumatized public noted they’re also taking comfort in the fact that no one in recent memory has been found using the cannibalized bones of their murder victims to construct some sort of ghoulish shrine in their home or to conduct bizarre sexual rituals of any kind.“Obviously it’s depressing to read about someone who gets into a petty argument with his roommates and winds up killing them which is still pretty common” said Michelle Boland of Terre Haute IN one of many Americans who expressed gratitude that a killer known only as the Cincinnati Skinner is not presently stalking the Midwest. “But it’s much much worse to read about someone who chops up his roommates and then eats them. We’ve had a good long stretch since something like that’s happened.”“Seriously what’s it been?” Boland added. “Five six months? I’ll take that.”Recognizing their current run of good luck won’t last forever many Americans told reporters they intend to make the best of it while they can. Even if the streak ends tomorrow they said they will always be thankful none of the national news stories from the past several weeks have involved two men with cannibal fetishes filming their graphic murder-suicide pact for YouTube.“When you really think about it it’s actually kind of a miracle there isn’t a guy out there right now killing random people and turning them into quilts or something” Provo UT store clerk Robert Zenner said. “You have to give credit where credit is due. It really is a great thing that I’m not turning on the news and saying ‘Holy shit someone’s eaten their neighbor.’ Not at this particular moment in time at least.”At press time weary Americans confronted with news of a San Diego man who cooked and served his own genitals to a group of friends insisted the story “didn’t count” since no one was actually killed.

It’s annihilation on a global scale.”According to observers natural selection left a trail of dead in such conflict-plagued regions as sub-Saharan Africa the Pacific Ocean and the troposphere with the fatalities including slain emperor penguins coral snakes and blue-green algae as well as several swarms of blue-winged wasps an assortment of hyacinth clusters 131 orangutans and various microorganisms. All were reportedly unequipped to escape the terror sweeping their ecosystems.In what many are calling its most grotesque tactic the killer appeared to single out the most vulnerable organisms—particularly the young and the physically weak—for its murderous rampage slaughtering them without mercy as other members of their species fled in panic. Reports indicated those who escaped the carnage were left with no choice but to try to move on with their lives and survive even as the ruthless killer continued stalking them.Virtually no species was unaffected by yesterday’s killing spree experts stated.“This is the work of a killer without empathy without conscience” said Jyotsna Ramjee a University of Calcutta zoologist who confirmed that the day’s death toll was the largest on official records dating back to 1859 when the perpetrator was first identified. “We have just witnessed the deadliest moment in a genocide that aims to eradicate entire swaths of given populations taking them out methodically and with complete indifference. It’s annihilation on a global scale.”“As horrific as these recent killings have been I have no doubt there are more to come” she continued. “Even as we speak this vicious unfeeling butcher is sizing up new victims with no regard to their age gender or phylum. The deaths are so sudden and so pervasive it makes one wonder if anything can be done at all.”At press time sources confirmed the latest onslaught in the natural selection process had claimed the lives of a cottonwood tree 800 million saltwater amoebae and a Columbus OH delivery driver who accidentally ingested a food item containing peanuts.
2015-01-27T13:55:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/nation-s-landmarks-piled-in-single-location-for-easier-1819577417,Nation’s Landmarks Piled In Single Location For Easier Monitoring,BROADWATER NE—In a move aimed at protecting the nation’s natural and historical heritage from potential threats the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced this week it had relocated all major American landmarks into one big carefully guarded pile in the center of the country.Spanning 25 square miles in a remote section of western Nebraska the densely packed 5000-foot-high mound is said to contain every prominent national monument historically designated building and notable piece of public infrastructure from across the United States.“From a strategic perspective it just makes sense to put all these great symbols of America right here in one place where we can keep an eye on all of them at once” said Homeland Security secretary Jeh Johnson speaking in front of the pile within which reporters could see a span of the Golden Gate Bridge the extended arm of the Statue of Liberty and tucked beneath the St. Louis Arch the South Portico of the White House. “This way we don’t need to safeguard thousands of individual locations scattered all over the country. We can instead focus all our surveillance measures on this single heap.”“From now on making sure Independence Hall the Trans-Alaska Pipeline and Fenway Park are all safe and secure is as easy as doing a 20-minute perimeter patrol around the pile” Johnson added.Observers confirmed that within the tight confines of the pile one can find such familiar national landmarks as the Hoover Dam Willis Tower all bridges and tunnels going into or out of Manhattan the Lincoln Memorial Kennedy Space Center the newly opened One World Trade Center Fort Sumter and most of the country’s international airports. In addition authorities confirmed all 50 statehouses have been relocated to the site.According to sources within the government the new plan will greatly simplify national security efforts as the area can be protected by just a couple dozen guards stationed every half mile along the pile’s periphery. DHS officials also confirmed that a chain-link fence has been erected around the entire site and that the barrier will be topped with razor wire which experts believe will serve as an added deterrent.“I never thought I’d be able to put my family in the car drive for three hours and see the Pearl Harbor memorial but here we are.”“In addition to helping keep these famous symbols of America safe from a variety of manmade and natural threats consolidating the most popular sites on the National Register of Historic Places into a single giant mound has allowed us to cut costs dramatically” said James Clapper the director of national intelligence. “Obviously we’ve suffered some setbacks with Monticello and the Mesa Verde cliff dwellings crumbling during our attempts to transport them here but in the long run we’re reducing our burden on taxpayers.”“Best of all our intelligence agencies will be able to oversee the landmarks from headquarters located right here in Broadwater NE” continued Clapper “which is now of course the United States capital given the presence of the U.S. Capitol building the Supreme Court the National Mall the Pentagon and several hundred other federal buildings.”Many Americans have reportedly been critical of the project noting that Wyoming’s Devils Tower had been haphazardly placed atop the pile almost completely crushing the Las Vegas Strip and Grand Central Terminal below it. At the same time sources noted that the original copy of the U.S. Constitution was allegedly misplaced in the mile-high stack though officials from the National Archives assured the public that the document was “probably somewhere under the Alamo.”However sources confirmed that the first tourists to arrive at the massive pile had issued few complaints with many telling reporters they had enjoyed visiting over 2500 national landmarks in one convenient location.“I never thought I’d be able to put my family in the car drive for three hours and see the Pearl Harbor memorial but here we are” 46-year-old Denver resident Kurt Riggins said as he toured the new resting place of the USS Arizona. “It would have taken us years to see all this stuff if we’d had to travel all over the country. And I’ve gotta say it was pretty cool to walk through the doors of Frank Lloyd Wright’s Fallingwater and look out on Mount Rushmore in the very spot where the Battle of Bunker Hill took place.”“Unfortunately I haven’t seen Carlsbad Caverns yet” he added. “I was told Carlsbad Caverns was in there.”

Moreover sources confirmed that many of the nation’s reeducation centers are forced to make do with indoctrination videos that are only available on grainy damaged VHS tapes while others still reportedly utilize antiquated audio equipment to play tinny records of the Chinese National Anthem every 15 minutes.“The last thing we want is for state prisoners to fall behind and end up getting stuck in the system for several extra years. If we get them out there we know they can thrive as pliant mouthpieces for the Communist Party.”State officials also stressed the need for rapid improvement citing international comparison studies that showed Chinese reeducation facilities consistently ranked behind those of North Korea in coercive persuasion tactics and torturing techniques.“These dissidents simply cannot be expected to learn when our camps have one overworked instructor juggling the needs of 50 prisoners” said Wu adding that because of their onerous workloads administrators often had no choice but to stay late even after a full 16-hour day of shocking journalists with electric prods until they confessed to subverting state authority. “Because our rooms are crammed so full many reeducators feel unmotivated to do anything but teach to the Little Red Book; they never provide individualized attention to dissidents.”“The last thing we want is for state prisoners to fall behind and end up getting stuck in the system for several extra years” she continued. “If we get them out there we know they can thrive as pliant mouthpieces for the Communist Party.”Many administrators meanwhile reportedly expressed their growing frustration with the low budgets at their reeducation facilities noting that dissidents were often still handwriting confessions and that some programs were so underfunded instructors had to buy their own supplies for daily torture exercises.“People don’t realize how much easier it becomes to dismantle the mental faculties of members of an underground artistic movement and insert them back into society as perfectly behaved factory workers when you’re given the right tools and training” said Gao Yang the current head of Huludao City Correctional Camp. “We believe that these people can go on to change the world in exactly the way we prescribe as long as we’re able to adequately prepare them for a life of complete submission and fealty.”“That’s why it’s so important that we invest heavily in our reeducation system to build a better future for China” Gao continued. “Or alternatively we could just shoot them all dead.”
2015-01-22T09:09:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/nation-s-historians-warn-the-past-is-expanding-at-alarm-1819577385,Nation’s Historians Warn The Past Is Expanding At Alarming Rate,WASHINGTON—Painting a stark portrait of a phenomenon that appears to be irreversible a report published Thursday by the American Historical Association has found that the past is currently expanding at an alarming rate.The comprehensive 950-page study compiled by a panel of the nation’s most prominent historians warns that the sum total of past time grows progressively larger each day making it unlikely anything can be done to halt or even slow down the relentless trend.“We believe the past is larger now than it’s ever been before” said College of William and Mary professor Timothy Gibbon lead author of the report observing that whole generations of people have already become a part of history and that if nothing changes an untold number more can expect the same fate. “Many things that are in the past today were during our parents’ and grandparents’ time still in the present—or even the future. Based on precise measurements of its size we believe the past has subsumed every single person and event that has ever existed.”“It’s shocking to contemplate but in the relatively short stretch since 1984 when I first began tracking its growth the past has expanded by more than 30 years” he added.“Presidential administrations extinct species ancient empires—all have been claimed by a relentless past. There was some speculation that World War II would end history but it didn’t.”The report predicted this disturbing pattern will only continue with one occurrence after another becoming part of a “colossal” historical record that by all indications appears intent on seizing absolutely everything without any discrimination. To date nothing no matter how significant has been able to escape the past which historians say has taken hold of episodes as momentous as the invention of the printing press the execution of Louis XVI numerous ice ages the westward expansion of the United States and the year 1995 among billions of others.“This massive unrestricted accrual of time is quickly becoming unmanageable—it’s growing bigger and bigger even now as I speak” said Gibbon who confirmed the past grew by more than six months in the time it took to research and write the new report. “Presidential administrations extinct species ancient empires—all have been claimed by a relentless past. There was some speculation that World War II would end history but it didn’t.”“Neither did the moon landing the signing of the Magna Carta the formation of Pangaea the extinction of the dinosaurs the fall of the Ming dynasty the breaking apart of Pangaea or the discovery of the Higgs boson” he continued. “Indeed these events have only served to make the past even larger.”The report went on to state that concerns over the expanding past were outweighed only by fears about the future which is assumed to become vanishingly small with each passing moment.
2015-01-19T12:39:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/chicago-introduces-new-citywide-gun-sharing-stations-1819577357,Chicago Introduces New Citywide Gun-Sharing Stations,CHICAGO—Touting the program’s convenience and affordability Chicago officials unveiled Monday the city’s new gun-sharing service “QuikShot” which allows individuals to check out a loaded firearm for short periods of time.The municipal initiative through which users can rent semiautomatic pistols shotguns rifles and submachine guns at more than 250 self-service kiosks has reportedly been designed to make firepower easily available to residents and tourists alike nearly everywhere within the city limits.“QuikShot lets anyone with a credit card walk up to one of our street-side firearm stations select a gun and head out into the Windy City fully armed in just a few seconds” program director Arvind Reynolds told reporters noting that borrowers can either rent their weapon for increments of 30 minutes or withdraw it for a full 24 hours if they plan on using it throughout the day. “With QuikShot you and your friends can each take a Beretta up to Wrigley Field or you can head to an outdoor concert in Millennium Park with a concealed 9mm revolver or you can simply take in the great view of the Magnificent Mile from the roof deck of the Hancock tower through a scoped sniper rifle. The possibilities are truly endless with QuikShot.”“And if the guns at one station are all checked out users only have to walk a block or two to the next one in order to find a loaded firearm” he added. “So whether you’ve been planning an outing for a while or simply decided to head out in the spur of the moment QuikShot has you covered.”According to sources after paying a small registration fee QuikShot users may rent a firearm as often as they wish in neighborhoods ranging from Edgewater in the north to the downtown Loop business district to Hyde Park on the South Side allowing them to brandish and discharge one or more rounds wherever they choose to in the city. Additionally due to higher demand Chicago officials said that multiple QuikShot kiosks would be opened around highly trafficked destinations such as Navy Pier the Art Institute the Water Tower Place shopping center and the Chicago Lakefront running and cycling paths.Because the firearms are expected to see heavy use Reynolds confirmed that repair crews would regularly monitor the city’s reholstering docks in order to clean and reload the weapons as well as to replace guns that have jammed or misfired during operation ensuring that borrowers aren’t inconvenienced by their gun malfunctioning at a crucial moment.“It’s a great addition to the city—nothing beats being able to run out of my apartment and have a gun in my hands whenever I want.”Users however are reportedly expected to provide their own protective Kevlar body armor with program administrators adding that the city of Chicago is not liable for any injuries incurred due to use of its rentals.“It’s a great addition to the city—nothing beats being able to run out of my apartment and have a gun in my hands whenever I want” said Lincoln Park resident Keith Madsen 32 noting that a QuikShot membership is much more economical than purchasing and maintaining his own extended magazine AR-15 assault rifle. “Even if I’m not necessarily planning on firing a gun on any given day it’s always nice to know that I have the option if something comes up.”Sources confirmed that the city is planning to expand the service in the months ahead by purchasing more guns with the goal of increasing its publicly available arsenal to more than 65000 weapons in anticipation of the hot summer months when QuikShot usage is expected to reach its peak.“QuikShot is so easy that I’m actually shooting a handgun way more often than I normally would” said local resident Danny Taylor who participated in a pilot trial of the program as he deposited an empty .357 Magnum with the QuikShot logo imprinted on its grip at a Rogers Park reholstering station. “Whether I’m going to a house party or just to the liquor store it’s nice to know that I can grab a piece use it for as long as I want and then drop it off without a lot of fuss.”“In fact I’m thinking about checking out one tomorrow morning before I head into the office” he continued.

After doing so they will reportedly be granted a number of perks including Medicare coverage and Social Security payouts for longer-tenured nationals as well as freedom of speech and the right to a trial by jury through April 15.Officials also noted that those individuals receiving severance would be encouraged to take advantage of federal outplacement services that will assist them in finding a country or sovereign principality for which they are a better fit.“This arrangement benefits all parties. It allows the U.S. to streamline its operations and invest more heavily in our standout residents and taxpayers while providing those who are no longer with us the tools they need to move on to the next chapter of their lives.”“While we understand that this denaturalization initiative may not be welcomed by many of our residents we want to make sure that they are leaving on good terms” said U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services director León Rodríguez who will be conducting exit interviews with each of the departing citizens in order to gather survey data that can be used to improve the experience of the remaining American people. “This arrangement benefits all parties. It allows the U.S. to streamline its operations and invest more heavily in our standout residents and taxpayers while providing those who are no longer with us the tools they need to move on to the next chapter of their lives.”According to sources throughout the nation the citizenship cuts have been widely met with shock and even outrage with some former Americans refusing to emigrate forcing the National Guard to firmly escort these disruptive individuals to the nearest border with either Canada or Mexico while the State Department invalidates their passports.However many severance recipients told reporters that their discharge did not come as a surprise with several noting that they “already had one foot out the door” by the time they were presented with the nonnegotiable terms of their departure.“I’ve seen the direction America has been headed in for a while so when they gave me the opportunity to look for a new country while still receiving federal grant money for graduate school I jumped on it” said Chicago resident Mark Ipser 32 admitting that long before he was offered severance he had been using a significant portion of his time in the U.S. to “scope out” potential countries where he now plans to apply for citizenship. “I’ve already got some promising leads in Europe—those Scandinavian countries offer incredible health plans and the vacation days don’t hurt either. And if all else fails I can just take a quick residence opportunity in Central America while I look for more stable long-term citizenship somewhere else.”“Granted I gave some of the best years of my life to the U.S.” he continued. “But with all of the bullshit I’ve had to deal with recently I’m not going to miss this place one bit.”

They don’t know any precedents yet. It takes time but several decades down the line they’ll be unbelievably powerful.”“Even though the baby justices are still struggling to move we have to separate them or they’ll violently peck at each other” Kennedy added. “They’re just so adorable though. I really want to hold that little constructionist one.”“They’re just so adorable though. I really want to hold that little constructionist one.”According to the court clerks the newly hatched jurists who must remain under a heat lamp at all times for warmth will not be able to open their eyes for at least three days or hear oral arguments until the remaining deutoplasm drains from their rudimentary ear canals.Sources confirmed that the wet and mewing baby justices currently lack the strength to dissent from denial of certiorari; however members of the Supreme Court were reportedly thrilled to witness the diminutive judicial experts attempt to thrust their heads forward and chirp their first decision on the regulatory scope of the Commerce Clause.Several reports also indicated that the Supreme Court bailiff forcibly removed Justice Scalia from the scene to prevent the conservative textualist from eating the smaller weaker baby justices who he noticed were expressing personal views on public policy.“The hatchlings have already imprinted on Justice Ginsburg whom they saw first” said Chief Justice John Roberts examining the incubator filled with exhausted baby jurists curled up and sleeping on a bed of case files and related legal materials. “Ruth has been following them closely these last few weeks. She was the first person to notice their muffled peeps of judicial interpretation while they were still inside their eggs.”“Ruth helped them put on their little robes to stop their shivering after they emerged and they seem to be acquiring a number of her behavioral characteristics” Roberts added. “The baby justices are already acting as staunch defenders of privacy rights.”At press time half of the baby justices had died from dehydration after Justice Alito forgot to fill their water dish.
2015-01-12T09:12:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/guards-gun-down-four-angels-escaping-from-heaven-1819577382,Guards Gun Down Four Angels Escaping From Heaven,THE HEAVENS—Killing four and critically wounding several others armed guards dispatched from the Right Hand of God reportedly opened fire early Monday morning on a group of angels attempting to escape from heaven.One of the Eternal Kingdom’s night watchmen confirmed he spotted the angels during a 3 a.m. searchlight sweep of heaven’s perimeter and raised the alarm thwarting the divine beings’ effort to break through an electrified portion of the Pearly Gates which are infrequently patrolled at that hour.“Early this morning 10 angels—seven cherubim and three seraphim—were fired upon by guards” said heaven spokeswoman Claudia Thompson observing that the escapees had ignored several warnings issued in Hebrew Aramaic and Greek. “Several of the angels were struck in the chest and wings. Four later succumbed to their injuries after being transferred to an infirmary located in the intake/release complex within the ninth sphere of heaven.”“The angels know the rules” she continued. “While the use of deadly force is always a last resort our guards are trained to use any means necessary to prevent escape from everlasting paradise.”While stressing that the incident was still under investigation Thompson said it appeared the angels had somehow obtained the Keys to the Kingdom allowing them to unlock the doors of the Eternal House Not Built by Human Hands. Surveillance footage suggests the spiritual beings donned hoods to dim the gleam of their halos avoided motion detectors by following a carefully plotted path down the gold-paved streets and then made a break for it across heaven’s green pastures and still waters.Heaven staff stated that at this time they are not ruling out the possibility that the angels might have had assistance from powerful archangels on the outside.“The escape attempt also makes them ineligible for our work-release program through which they might one day have qualified for a job as a messenger guardian or avenging angel.”“As per standard protocol the surviving escapees will be locked down in purgatory for two to three millennia before they are allowed to rejoin the general angelic population” Thompson said. “The escape attempt also makes them ineligible for our work-release program through which they might one day have qualified for a job as a messenger guardian or avenging angel.”A statement provided to the press identified the four dead angels as Zophiel Jehoel Shamsiel and Metatron.According to celestial sources this is heaven’s first breakout attempt since 1996 when two angels brutally garroted a guard with a harp string and managed to descend through the firmament into earthly realms. They were apprehended four weeks later when they were found hiding in the dome of St. Peter’s Basilica.Records also indicate that in the 1940s a single determined angel devoted years to a clandestine effort to tunnel beneath a wall of the heavenly city but was ultimately unable to penetrate heaven’s 12 reinforced foundations of jasper sapphire agate emerald onyx ruby chrysolite beryl topaz turquoise jacinth and amethyst described in the Book of Revelation.Reached for comment God who oversees What No Eye Has Seen Nor Ear Heard Nor the Heart of Man Conceived praised the guards’ forceful reaction remarking that they had done their jobs by neutralizing the escaping angels and securing the afterlife.“I run a tight kingdom and when rules are broken there will be consequences” said the Almighty telling reporters that heaven would be reevaluating security procedures and reinforcing its three gates on the east three on the north three on the south and three on the west. “The angels don’t get to choose how long they stay in heaven; I do.”“This is a serious business” He added. “The last thing we want is a repeat of what happened with Saint Thomas Aquinas who broke loose and has been on the lam for the past 700 years.”

Today it is our duty to preserve the chain of dynastic succession and to justly enforce pet-leashing regulations and the one-vehicle-on-street parking rule.”“Since the time of our founding I’m proud to say that only a rightful heir has ever been granted the power to distribute keys to the pool area” Klein added.According to reports the board’s pristine lineage has largely been upheld through the arranged betrothal of marriageable sons and daughters a process that involves intricate negotiations typically brokered at elite gatherings such as the subdivision’s Fourth of July cookout its annual golf tournament and Saturday morning water aerobics.Through the strategic selection of spouses for their children condo board directors are said to consolidate their grip on the interests they deem most vital including who has access to the “OakTerr-Master” Excel spreadsheet that tracks dues payments monitors the garbage pickup schedule and records picnic pavilion reservations.“We married our firstborn to the Freeland clan of the Pine Court cul-de-sac near the tennis courts and together we have forged a powerful alliance” said board vice president Loretta Shaw a mother of three daughters who has been seen eyeing one of Walt Foreman’s boys a son of pure breeding with an uncle on the landscaping committee. “But relations between our two houses have been strained since last spring when [condo board secretary] Sarah [Freeland] sabotaged my motion to have the front gate and mailbox station repainted.”“Regardless my daughters must have husbands with only the most honorable blood in their veins. A lesser match would not befit a family who wields control of the neighborhood sinking fund and appoints judges to preside over the holiday lighting contest.”“Regardless my daughters must have husbands with only the most honorable blood in their veins” she continued. “A lesser match would not befit a family who wields control of the neighborhood sinking fund and appoints judges to preside over the holiday lighting contest.”Sources confirmed the engagement of a child to any lowborn spouse who cannot trace his or her lineage back to at least the development’s third phase of construction would be social suicide for a board member. By all accounts Oakwood Terrace was scandalized six years ago when the scion of the recreation coordinator’s family eloped with a “usurping harlot” from a timeshare property on the other side of Route 640.The clubhouse where the directors convene every other Thursday to discuss pressing matters of the condo association has long been full of intrigue according to minutes-keeper Allan Snyder whose family has for multiple generations recorded the most minor detail of every meeting in a word-processing document that dates back to the reign of legendary board president Bruce Dalton.“As you might well expect the power to schedule routine lawn pesticide treatments does not change hands peaceably” Snyder said. “May God protect the ruling families of Oakwood Terrace and their sacred right to decree that each unit—whether detached home or multifamily dwelling—be painted only in the colors of the realm!”“Tan with white trim” he added in clarification.
2015-01-07T15:25:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/it-sadly-unclear-whether-this-article-will-put-lives-at-1819577328,It Sadly Unclear Whether This Article Will Put Lives At Risk,PARIS—Following the fatal terrorist attack Wednesday at the offices of French newspaper Charlie Hebdo sources confirmed this afternoon that it is sadly not yet clear whether this very article will ultimately put human lives at risk.According to totally and utterly depressing early reports given the tragic deaths of 12 people it is impossible to say with absolute certainty that this 500-word article will not make those involved in its writing—and potentially even those not involved—the targets of brutal and unconscionable violence.“The heartbreaking tragedy that unfolded in Paris today is the result of a perverted hateful ideology that has no place in the civilized world” is a quote that someone or some group of people might be reading at this very moment and in what unfortunately serves to illustrate the horrifying state of modern society interpreting as an unforgivable insult against their beliefs that must be met with the cold-blooded murder of innocent people. “It’s just so terrible and senseless. I mean how can something like this even happen?”“I’m at a loss for words to be perfectly honest” is a further quote that would hopefully not enrage anyone to the point of actually taking another human being’s life but which for the love of God conceivably could.Those familiar with the situation told reporters that if someone were to read the very words written here and be offended by them it would be reasonable to expect them to be upset and—at worst—write an angry letter to this publication expressing their ire in a relatively calm and composed fashion. Reports further confirmed that to somehow use this article—or indeed any article or any piece of self-expression—as a pretext to violence let alone deadly violence is simply impossible to justify and should never ever transpire in human civilization.Then again sources added that’s what actually happened today.Sickened distraught and profoundly sad sources further added it was fully within the realm of possibility that it could happen again.“Today’s horrific events only reinforce the idea that we cannot and will not let extremist zealots dictate what we can and cannot say” is a comment that we will quote but one that we do with a legitimate sense of uncertainty over whether it could incite an attack against the speaker or their loved ones a sense of uncertainty that feels awful grotesque and wholly unnecessary in this day and age. “We live in a society in which every person is entitled to his or her own opinions and every person is entitled to express those opinions without fear of harm. And that isn’t changing whether a small minority of psychotic murderous degenerates like it or not.”At press time although the consequences of this article are reportedly still unclear and actual human lives may hang in the balance sources confirmed that the best thing to do—really the only thing to do—is to simply put it out there and just hope that it does some good.
2015-01-06T08:25:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/government-admits-it-was-only-behind-destruction-of-nor-1819577326,Government Admits It Was Only Behind Destruction Of North Tower,WASHINGTON—Saying they felt a duty to reveal what truly transpired on September 11 2001 numerous high-ranking federal officials announced publicly Tuesday that the United States government was responsible for destroying just the North Tower of the World Trade Center.Representatives from the Central Intelligence Agency National Security Agency and half a dozen other government bureaus revealed at a morning press conference that they were responsible for the development funding and execution of a plan to take down 1 World Trade Center in New York’s Financial District. Describing their mission as an unqualified success officials noted that the completion of their objective was followed 17 minutes later by a separate suicide attack on 2 World Trade Center by al-Qaeda operatives piloting a hijacked airliner.“The American people deserve to know that of the two towers that were brought down in Lower Manhattan on 9/11 only one was the target of the federal government” said CIA spokesman Tom McLennan emphasizing that their carefully guarded plot was a wholly independent event planned without any foreknowledge of the similar act of terrorism designed by al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden for the same day. “While we freely admit our culpability in striking the first building let us be clear that we had no hand in destroying the other tower. In fact that was just as shocking and devastating to us as it was to all American citizens.”“Aside from our controlled implosion of Tower No. 1 we can assure the public that the September 11 attacks were carried out by Islamic radicals as part of their war against the West” McLennan added.According to recently declassified intelligence briefings and memos FBI agents began making nighttime deliveries of thousands of pounds of RDX explosives to the World Trade Center in January 2001 as part of the first phase of what government officials dubbed Operation North Tower. Detailed schematics confirm that the charges were placed within Tower No. 1 according to an Army Corps of Engineers demolition plan designed to take down the 1368-foot-tall skyscraper without damaging any of the surrounding structures including the adjacent Tower No. 2.In what they described as the most logical cover for their plan to bring down one of the Twin Towers government officials then outlined their process of guiding a commercial airliner into the building via remote control. Military leaders assured American citizens that while they in fact had deployed a black-ops team to Boston’s Logan Airport the night of September 10 2001 to plant the RC transponder on a single West Coast-bound flight the aircraft that crashed into 2 World Trade Center the next morning was flown solely by jihadists about whom they had no prior knowledge.The nation’s leaders also reiterated throughout the briefing that the Mossad agents who initially proposed the plan to the U.S. did not have any involvement in the attack on the South Tower either.“No one had any idea who was controlling that other plane. We were celebrating quite a bit after our successful strike but when the second one hit it pretty much silenced the entire Pentagon Command Center.”“By ordering NORAD to deactivate the nation’s air defenses on 9/11 we succeeded in clearing a path to Manhattan for our plane but this apparently created a window of opportunity for five al-Qaeda operatives who ostensibly departed on another aircraft just a few minutes after our plane did” said NSA officer Will Mason adding that FAA leaders were instructed to delay reporting the radio-controlled airliner’s deviations from its flight path that morning but immediately began panicking once they noticed the similar behavior of a second aircraft. “No one had any idea who was controlling that other plane. We were celebrating quite a bit after our successful strike but when the second one hit it pretty much silenced the entire Pentagon Command Center.”“Obviously had we been aware that the South Tower was going to be hit we would have given all Jewish workers advance notice to stay out of that building as well” he added.Officials then explained how on that Tuesday morning President George W. Bush was quietly informed by an aide during an elementary school appearance that the plan had been carried out with precision only to be notified just minutes later that the United States was under attack.“The scripts we had given every major news anchor were pretty much useless after that second impact” said CIA agent Donald Macy noting that the highly orchestrated misinformation campaign they had crafted over 10 months only made sense within the original context of one building being targeted. “After that point any confusion was beyond our doing.”“Overall I would say the majority of the terror experienced by the nation that day was caused by somebody other than the U.S. government” he continued. “We were only behind about half of that.”Admitting that there were several major unexpected turns that day those behind the government’s attack maintained that regardless of the coincidence they still achieved the long-term results they ultimately wanted.
2015-01-05T10:27:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/supreme-court-releases-young-scalia-s-audition-tape-1819577315,Supreme Court Releases Young Scalia’s Audition Tape,WASHINGTON—Longtime fans of Associate Justice Antonin Scalia were rewarded Monday when the U.S. Supreme Court released to the public archival footage of the jurist’s pivotal 1986 audition for a seat on the nation’s highest court.According to legal scholars the previously unseen video which features a fresh-faced 50-year-old Scalia sporting a shock of flowing jet-black hair and energetically riffing on the framers’ original intent provides an early glimpse of the developing talents of the up-and-coming judge who would eventually emerge as one of the nation’s preeminent interpreters of constitutional law.“He was still pretty green then but even so you could tell he had a lot of raw talent—he absolutely killed with this prepared bit he did on the Commerce Clause” said retired justice John Paul Stevens who in the tape can be heard off-camera playing the role of a dissenting judge as Scalia is tasked with analyzing the constitutional underpinnings of Roe v. Wade. “Watching it now his take on the Second Amendment seems really rough but you can see how he would eventually develop that early concept into his famous District of Columbia v. Heller majority opinion.”“There was something special there even if he stumbled a little while citing key provisions from the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure” Stevens added. “Of course at the time he was only a couple decades out of law school.”“He was a little wild that’s for sure but you could tell he was ambitious. I remember thinking ‘Man this guy is the most determined statutory textualist I’ve ever seen.’”Recorded before an audience of high-ranking officials that included all nine members of the Burger Court Attorney General Ed Meese and senior White House staff the 30-minute video shows Scalia being put through the paces of the Supreme Court’s legendarily difficult auditioning process which consists of rigorous mock hearings and jurisprudence drills as well as a cold read from a randomly chosen amicus curiae brief all performed on the institution’s famed courtroom floor.Though his aggressive style of oral argument was still unpolished at the time and there were no openings currently available on the court Scalia was reportedly told his name would be kept in mind in the event a spot opened up.Ultimately experts have said the tryout opened doors for the fledgling jurist by allowing him to showcase his now-trademark originalism noting in particular a segment of the tape in which he delivers what onlookers described as a memorable five-minute extemporaneous oration on the constitutional illegitimacy of gay rights and the Miranda rule.“I’d previously been out with our scouts to see him judge at the D.C. Circuit once or twice” said former Supreme Court clerk H. Geoffrey Moulton referring to the court of appeals that has famously served as a talent incubator for the federal judiciary providing many future justices—including judicial legends John Roberts Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the popular Fred M. Vinson—with a place to hone their skills. “He was a little wild that’s for sure but you could tell he was ambitious. I remember thinking ‘Man this guy is the most determined statutory textualist I’ve ever seen.’”“So we decided to bring him in for an audition to see what he could do” Moulton continued. “Some of my colleagues felt he was still too wet behind the ears but I was interested to find out how he’d perform on a bigger stage.”A few months later Scalia would get that chance when the Supreme Court needed a new justice and the U.S. Senate unanimously approved his nomination.When told by reporters that his audition tape had been released Scalia admitted that he himself hadn’t been very impressed with his performance at the time noting in particular that he “bombed” his interpretation of the state action doctrine.“Oh wow they dug up that old video?” said a chuckling Scalia who recalled that he was so nervous during his tryout he “practically sweat through [his] robes.” “I can only imagine what people in that room were thinking when this Italian kid from Queens came in there quoting those clichéd old Oliver Wendell Holmes opinions and waving his gavel around. But hey I got the gig.”Court watchers expect the Scalia video will prove far more popular than the release last summer of Associate Justice Clarence Thomas’ audition tape in which the then-42-year-old judge spent a full half hour staring into the camera in complete silence.
2015-01-05T10:21:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/scientists-speculate-extraterrestrials-may-have-complet-1819577314,Scientists Speculate Extraterrestrials May Have Completely Different Hair Than Humans,PALO ALTO CA—Citing the near infinite number of celestial bodies in the known universe an international panel of scientists at Stanford University released a report this week speculating that any extraterrestrials that exist may have hair entirely different from that of humans.The researchers who analyzed data on the vast variety of atmospheric and chemical conditions found on distant worlds suggested aliens could have hair with color and texture so different from that of human beings as to be virtually unrecognizable.“When you consider just how massive the universe is and just how many ways life could have evolved it’s likely extraterrestrials have hair we simply don’t have the vocabulary to describe” said astrobiologist Jeremy Rosenwald adding that a range of factors such as the amount of gravity or water on a planet could influence our very definition of silky kinky or wavy. “After all alien hair could be an adaptation to literally any imaginable environment. If we encountered an alien tomorrow who knows what hair we’d be dealing with?”“Think of it” Rosenwald continued. “Styling beyond the human brain’s capacity to even conceive.”“When you consider just how massive the universe is and just how many ways life could have evolved it’s likely extraterrestrials have hair we simply don’t have the vocabulary to describe.”Researchers used computer simulations to predict how hair might develop in a variety of extreme planetary conditions including severe cold sustained wind speeds in excess of 2000 miles per hour or the absence of an atmosphere altogether. Among their findings was reportedly the startling revelation that alien life forms might not only have brown black blond or red hair but hair whose natural color falls literally anywhere along the visual spectrum—or that is completely translucent.The scientists went on to suggest that because the differences between humans and extraterrestrials could extend to the fundamental building blocks of life alien organisms may even have a head of hair that parts horizontally across the top of their head rather than vertically at the center or to either side.“We were able to render several images of what we think bangs could look like if non-carbon-based organisms developed them in a 90 percent methane atmosphere” said astronomer Nigel Lucas. “But these are at best speculative exercises. With all the factors that come into play we honestly don’t know if the bangs would be side-swept peek-a-boo or some unearthly combination of both.”“And based on the age of the universe these creatures could be far more intelligent than we are and have civilizations with salons far more advanced than our own” continued Lucas. “In that case we’d be as bewildered by their approaches to feathering highlighting and chunking as the earliest hominid on the savanna would be by ours.”However because human beings have barely even begun to explore their infinitesimally small region of the universe Lucas told reporters that the odds of actually viewing extraterrestrial hair in our lifetime are extremely remote.“As a scientist it’s disappointing that I’ll almost certainly never see the hair on a creature from a planet that’s covered in ammonia seas or that’s many times hotter than our own sun” said Lucas. “I can only wonder if it wishes it could see my hair too.”

Indeed when faced with reducing hundreds of esteemed innovators philanthropists and thought leaders to a single deserving recipient the selection committee ultimately proved unable to choose just one man or woman who most embodies the values of integrity benevolence and courage that define this most prestigious of accolades.Thus following weeks of impassioned debate The Onion is proud to present for the first time ever the two co-winners of our Person of the Year award: Pakistani human rights advocate Malala Yousafzai and 12-time WWE champion John Cena.Over the course of the last year who could be said to have accomplished more and had a greater impact on the world than these two? Yousafzai: an impassioned defender of women’s rights who has risked her life to campaign for equal education opportunities for girls. Cena: a physically dominant strongman and submission specialist who has ascended to the top of the professional wrestling world through his combination of charisma athleticism and devastating finishing moves such as the “Attitude Adjustment” and the “STFU.”Truly no two more outstanding or inspirational figures could be said to exist.Of course though equals in the eyes of The Onion Yousafzai and Cena took markedly different paths to this year’s honor. Yousafzai survived a vicious assassination attempt by a Taliban gunman battling the odds to surmount her near-fatal injuries and emerging more dedicated than ever to advancing the ideals of equality and freedom. Much as Cena inspires countless millions of wrestling fans across the so-called Cenation Yousafzai inspires young girls around the globe even in spite of constant death threats and earlier this year made history by becoming at only age 17 the youngest-ever recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize.No less remarkable are the accomplishments of Cena whose work inside the ring has rightfully earned him praise and respect the world over. Just as Yousafzai survived an assassin’s bullets the fearless WrestleMania headliner has endured hundreds if not thousands of suplexes backbreakers and steel chair blows to the head and yet has refused to submit to a three count time and time again. And like the Pakistani activist Cena also proved his bravery standing tall in the face of a range of foes every bit as vicious as the Taliban including Roman Reigns Brock Lesnar and Kane. And though Cena’s list of victories is long and illustrious perhaps no occasion was more heartening than his heroism at this year's Money In The Bank pay-per-view in which he improbably won the main event ladder match to secure the WWE World Heavyweight Championship belt a celebrated prize rivaled only by the Nobel committee’s offering.As stated the voting process for this year’s award was competitive and impassioned. Faced with two icons of seemingly equal merit—Malala Yousafzai and John Cena—our panel was unable to decide which one was more deserving of our highest honor. Cena or Yousafzai? Just the fourth wrestler in history to win multiple Royal Rumble matches or a relentless crusader for equality and progress? Some choices cannot be made.And though Cena technically won by a handful of votes the selection committee ultimately determined that to place one above the other would be a disservice to them to their legacies and to you the reader. Therefore it is with great pleasure that The Onion presents our Person of the Year award to both humanitarian Malala Yousafzai and wrestler actor and rapper John Cena two sources of inspiration to a world in desperate need of heroes.

He said he looks forward to living in an area where white children can ride their bikes to school white parents exchange the latest news at youth hockey games and each year the town’s whites gather to watch the local production of A Christmas Carol.According to the Ohio native he wants his family to enjoy a peaceful life in which white people don’t bother locking their front doors and every white man white woman and white child goes to sleep at night feeling safe and secure.“I suppose it’s corny but the older I get the more I long for that ideal town with ball fields and picket fences and relaxing evening strolls down tree-lined streets past friendly white neighbors” said Jensen who lamented that during his time living in the city he’s never really felt like part of a close-knit white community. “I want to be able to sit on my front porch with a glass of lemonade knowing that I live in a place where white folks look out for each other. That’s where I’m most comfortable.”“Sadly there just aren’t a lot of places like that in this country anymore” he added.

That’s the deal.”“For this to work this kid is going to have to encourage every single student he engages with to see global citizenship in their sleep” continued Goodwin. “He sure as shit can’t get away with reciting just one poem in his native language at the Diversity Center.”Leverett College administrators also stipulated that the financial grant would require Soto to help build one hell of a rich heterogeneous community by appearing on the cover of the alumni magazine with a big fucking smile plastered across his face.“We’ve got a big fat $200000 check ready to go for a student from an underrepresented international background who can substantively enhance the educational experience and provide students with a rich multi-fucking-faceted view of their place in the world” said Leverett College president Warren Cronin. “If this kid’s anything like that guy we got from El Salvador a few years back who played a musical instrument made from a gourd we here at Leverett are going to be sitting real pretty.”“We’re hoping Jack Soto’s the student who can take us to that next damn level of multiculturalism” Cronin added. “If he gets his photo taken for the student newspaper while wearing traditional Burmese garb I think he very well could be.”At press time college officials confirmed that they had decided to use the full scholarship to lure away an affluent student from a more prestigious university so that her SAT scores would raise the average of the admitted class.
2014-12-05T10:30:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/pope-rummaging-through-vatican-basement-for-plastic-nat-1819577284,Pope Rummaging Through Vatican Basement For Plastic Nativity Scene Figures,VATICAN CITY—Hoping to have all his holiday decorations up by the weekend His Holiness Pope Francis has spent the past two hours rummaging through the basement of the papal apartments in search of the Vatican’s plastic nativity scene figures sources confirmed Friday.After climbing over dusty cases of sacramental wine and bins filled with mothballed vestments the pope reportedly found the set’s plywood manger in a corner of the room near the sump pump though sources noted he has yet to locate all the blow-molded polyethylene representations of the Holy Family and their Christmas visitors.“Oh come on where’s the third wise man?” the spiritual leader of 1.2 billion Roman Catholics said as he pushed aside several priceless Raphael and Fra Angelico paintings to peer into a cardboard box aided by the dim light of a bare bulb hanging overhead. “I could’ve sworn I put him away with everybody else. There’s a ton of donkeys and sheep in here but a lot of good that does me with only two wise men. Jeez.”“I don’t have time for this” he added. “I’ve still got an epistle that needs to be finished.”Designed for outdoor use the 14-piece set of internally lit plastic figurines was first purchased by Pope John Paul II in 1981 and every year since according to Vatican observers the reigning pontiff has personally assembled the nativity scene outside the Apostolic Palace in Saint Peter’s Square. The display including the colored lights that outline the manger and wrap around a few of the piazza’s iconic Tuscan colonnades is reportedly powered by an extension cord running from an outlet in the papal garage.After testing to confirm that Mary would still light up when plugged in Francis noted that the winters had taken their toll on the Blessed Virgin wearing away most of the paint on her face. He also added that he would likely have to display the statue of a kneeling Joseph at an awkward angle so as to obscure the dent in his head suffered during Benedict XVI’s papacy.Sources within the Holy See said that Francis has expressed dismay at his predecessor’s lax oversight of the nativity scene complaining about last Christmas—his first since assuming the Chair of St. Peter—when two long-missing shepherds and an Angel of the Lord were eventually discovered in a tub mislabeled “winter coats.”“You know what? I don’t think this baby Jesus is even from the same set” said the pope in audible exasperation pointing out that the unpainted plastic infant he found beneath a tangled ball of Christmas lights and a bag of old palm ashes had a much more simplistic design than the rest of the figures. “Ugh. I honestly wouldn’t mind if I thought people wouldn’t notice but he might not even fit inside the manger.”“He’s nearly the same size as Mary for God’s sake” Francis continued.According to reports the Holy Father spent 15 minutes this morning on an unsuccessful attempt to assemble the Christ Child’s crib but after snapping the dowel used to hold its wooden slats together he is said to have tossed the whole thing aside in frustration.Exhausted from his search through the basement the 77-year-old pontiff reportedly grew even more aggravated after banging his knee on a table and knocking over a stack of relics including several shards from the True Cross and a wrist bone of St. Gregory the Great.“Well it looks like we’re going without a Star of Bethlehem this year” the pope said before emitting an extended sigh. “We’ve got so many goddamn packages of tinsel down here I guess I’ll just dangle some of that from the roof and call it a day. If Cardinal [Angelo] Sodano complains he can deal with it himself. I’ve already spent way too much time on this.”Added the pope “Right now I really need to climb to the top of the Basilica dome and get Santa’s sleigh mounted on the roof.”
2014-12-04T09:01:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/world-leaders-gather-to-discuss-how-fucking-amazing-run-1819577270,World Leaders Gather To Discuss How Fucking Amazing Running A Country Is,ZURICH—Arriving from around the world for a three-day political summit the highest-ranking government officials from over 190 nations have gathered in Zurich this week for direct talks on how fucking incredible it is to run a country.The annual international forum which is attended by presidents prime ministers and various other heads of state from global superpowers as well as emerging countries is expected to address such longstanding points of discussion as how unbelievably awesome it is to control an entire nation’s political system command its military and directly influence the lives of every single person within its borders.“While those of us gathered in this room may have differences in our politics and our ideologies there is one thing that unites every one of us: We are each the single most influential valuable and powerful person in countries composed of millions of people and that is fucking amazing” said U.S. president Barack Obama in the summit’s opening keynote address. “Every single thing we do—simply because of who we are—is very very important. Honest to God I could stand up here and recite a string of random numbers for two hours if I wanted and it would be front-page news. Everything I’m saying right now is going to be all over magazines and the internet and—here’s what’s really insane—people will actually read every last word of it and analyze it. And best of all nobody can tell us what to do—nobody. Just think for a second about how goddamn incredible that is.”“I mean holy shit” Obama continued. “We can do anything. Fucking anything.”According to sources in attendance the conference began with a roundtable discussion regarding how awesome it is to go on national television at a moment’s notice while hundreds of journalists from their country’s most prominent media outlets clamor to hear them speak and ask them questions. Several breakout sessions were reportedly held later in the day during which Western and Asian leaders debated a variety of topics including having schools libraries and airports named after them; getting to look at top-secret documents every morning; seeing their pictures in the newspaper all the time; and having the power to declare full-scale wars on other countries—each of which was confirmed by officials to totally kick ass.Sources revealed that a subcommittee of G8 nations then engaged in high-level talks until the early hours of the morning ultimately issuing a joint statement affirming the stance that it’s totally mind-blowing to possess nuclear launch codes and to be “no shit one phone call away from dropping an actual atomic bomb.”“Each of the attendees has been highly pleased with the talks thus far” said summit aide Zachary Bellion adding that there was unanimous agreement on a proposal requiring all world leaders to take a few moments every day to consider just how unbelievable it is to have famous actors portray their lives in television shows and movies. “Perhaps the most emotional moment came when Ecuadorian president Rafael Correa rose to speak. He delivered an impassioned address in which he stressed that despite leading a relatively small nation he still has an around-the-clock security staff whose job entails taking a bullet for him if necessary which he said is pretty much the most badass thing ever. His words brought the entire assembly to its feet in raucous applause. It was incredibly moving.”Despite a largely cordial atmosphere several points of contention have reportedly arisen throughout the conference most notably when various heads of the European Union disagreed with Chinese president Xi Jinping’s assertion that the coolest aspect of running a country is having a 20-vehicle motorcade wherever you go. European officials were reportedly adamant that being saluted by military officers on the tarmac while stepping off a private jet is way fucking cooler—with German chancellor Angela Merkel in particular steadfastly refusing to concede the point—which led to a brief diplomatic impasse.Tensions are said to have quickly dissipated however after leaders voted on the question of how much it rules to be flown to places like Zurich and stay in the nicest hotels for free while spending time with other incredibly powerful world leaders with a final vote of 192 to 0 determining that it “rules so freaking hard.”The assembly also reportedly reached an overwhelming consensus on the position that after running a country going back to not running a country at some point would really really fucking suck.“The summit has been very successful in bringing leaders together to find common ground that we can all unequivocally agree on” Russian president Vladimir Putin told reporters after closed-door talks with U.K. prime minister David Cameron over how cool as shit it is to know that they both will be written about in history books and encyclopedias for hundreds of years to come. “Like the rest of the attendees here I can declare a national state of emergency and have tanks on the streets in a matter of hours. I can spend taxpayer money on whatever the hell I want. Hell I can make tomorrow Vladimir Putin Day if I really feel like it.”“Being in charge of a country is the fucking best” added Putin smiling. “And I plan on doing it for a long long time.”
2014-12-02T13:21:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/new-express-transplant-list-offers-patients-kidney-or-f-1819577251,New Express Transplant List Offers Patients Kidney Or First Available Organ,WASHINGTON—In an effort to shorten the wait time for dialysis patients in need of a donor the Department of Health and Human Services this week opened a new express transplant list to the public that matches candidates with either a kidney or any other organ at all.According to sources the new system allows patients to select from a list of alternative organs such as a heart liver or lung that they would like to receive should a kidney be unavailable. By no longer restricting kidney patients to one specific donor organ officials estimate that the average wait for transplant candidates will fall dramatically from an average of three to five years to less than 24 hours.“With over 100000 people currently unable to find kidney transplants this expedited list will ensure that each and every one of them receives at least some type of organ in a timely manner” said HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell adding that in some instances patients have been ushered into surgery minutes after signing the registration form. “The long wait puts unnecessary stress on those who are already sick so we hope to alleviate that pressure by quickly locating and implanting whatever we can get our hands on.”“Getting a kidney is ideal but a pancreas can be a precious gift too” Burwell added.Whereas more than 4000 people died annually while waiting for a transplant under the old system the upgraded list has reportedly eliminated this problem completely with every patient rapidly receiving a kidney or a more immediately obtainable organ. In addition to major organs sources said the new protocols allow for kidneys to be replaced with tissue such as nerve bundles or lumps of cartilage.The new list has reportedly drawn praise from patients who have seen their anxiety vanish virtually overnight at the prospect of their diseased kidneys quickly being exchanged for more accessible body parts.“I was so sick of leaving my fate up in the air using the old system never knowing if I’d get the transplant I needed in time” said 58-year-old diabetic Janet Martin who selected an intestinal tract a thymus gland and 17 other potential backups for the kidney she has been waiting on since 2010. “Now I know there’s a 100 percent chance I’ll get a new organ and there’s a 5 percent chance it’ll be the one I really want.”“That certainty means so much” Martin added. “I don’t have to lie awake worrying—I’m getting a kidney or something else real soon.”But despite the speedy access to transplant organs provided by the new list critics have alleged that more affluent individuals are offered their preferred kidney alternatives while less well-off patients are consistently presented with their least desired options.“If I couldn’t get a kidney I would have been fine with a gallbladder a cornea a spleen—a whole bunch of things” said Christopher Corvese 42 who suffers from a genetic condition that produces cysts in kidney tissue. “I bet if I were a millionaire I’d probably get the heart valve I was really excited about. But no I got offered a face transplant which was way way at the bottom for me.”“I’ll take it of course” added Corvese. “I mean it’s better than nothing.”

You start smelling things that aren’t there.”“A couple of us are going to try it next month during our class camping trip” McLean added.According to researchers U.S. students also lead the world in their awareness of liquor stores a few towns away that don’t check I.D. if you have a beard.

It’s always tragic but at least when they pass away they get to be with the people they worked with nearly every day. That is until [manager] Alec [Peters] comes over and reminds us we have to get back to unloading the trucks.”“It’s just comforting to know that when my time comes I’ll have everyone here in the stockroom by my side too” he added.
2014-11-21T10:39:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/corporate-america-shaken-by-death-of-longtime-consumer-1819577221,Corporate America Shaken By Death Of Longtime Consumer,CHARLESTON SC—Expressing shock and an immense sense of grief numerous high-ranking figures across corporate America were reportedly left shaken Friday after learning of the sudden death of longtime consumer Arthur Henderson.Executives within the multi-billion-dollar retail technology dining and hospitality and financial services industries told reporters that they were completely blindsided by the 68-year-old retiree’s abrupt passing emphasizing that the beloved reliable customer continued spending until his final moments.“When I heard the devastating news about Arthur’s death this morning I immediately had this awful sinking realization that he wouldn’t be coming into our Charleston locations ever again” said visibly distressed Target Corporation CEO Brian Cornell while being comforted by members of the company’s board of directors. “One day he seems as good as ever regularly purchasing name-brand products then wham—you’re doing everything possible to keep it together while looking over his online profile and spending history and coming to grips with the fact that he’ll never use his loyalty card again.”“I started crying when I thought back on his 2008 purchase of a 50-inch wide-screen television” added Cornell. “It was a Christmas present. He was a real good revenue stream—one of the best.”When reached for comment Fortune 500 executives confirmed that the unexpected loss of Henderson a valued customer who for decades could always be counted on to purchase impulse items in the checkout line felt like a “punch in the gut.” In particular Walgreens CEO Gregory D. Wasson expressed sorrow over what he described as “an impossible-to-fill void” in the company’s earnings reports telling reporters that he would never forget the way Henderson would always grab a pack of M&M’s or a Golf Digest at the register.Describing the consumer’s death as “heartbreaking” high-ranking corporate officers reportedly attempted to alleviate their despair by fondly reminiscing about how the Charleston SC resident would occasionally purchase extended warranties and would never send in rebates—a characteristic trait of Henderson’s that several department store CEOs admitted they would “miss most of all.”“You just thought Arthur was going to keep spending and spending for years to come but then just like that he’s gone” said AT&T Inc. CEO Randall L. Stephenson adding that he could always depend on Henderson to continue making payments on the landline he rarely used. “This hit our top management really hard. Everyone wishes we could see him switch to a higher data plan again like he did back in June 2011. That was a really wonderful moment that will always have a special place in our hearts.”According to sources the nation’s top executives spent much of the morning marveling at how Henderson touched so much of the business community over the course of his life from simple acts like eating at fast food restaurants or renting on-demand movies to bigger deeds such as refinancing his mortgage—all of which helped build a lasting connection between him and corporate America.In fact many business leaders admitted that the death of someone as dependable and adored as Henderson had inspired them to pause for a moment and truly value their consumer base.“If there’s anything I’ve learned from Arthur’s passing it’s that you need to cherish every moment you have with your customers whether they’re rewards members or not” said ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson. “Even our most beloved customers who regularly fill up their RVs are going to die eventually. It happens to everyone.” “It’s important to keep the consumers you care about close while you still can because when they pass away they’ll never register another point-of-sale transaction with you ever again” added Tillerson appearing to hold back tears. “But it’s just so hard. There’s nothing I want more than for Arthur to pay $100 to fill up the tank of his Chevy Silverado one last time.”

The Orange County native reasoned that the hundreds of millions of people who compose society had made a conscious collective decision to grant him such perks and that it was not for him to question their judgment.Pointing to his strong educational advantages and the fact that he has never once felt threatened by law enforcement Naylor acknowledged his situation contrasts starkly with that of individuals who lack the resources necessary to ensure they will never have to try particularly hard to obtain the things they want.“I look around and see a lot of people who don’t have what I have which leads me to conclude our social institutions have these built-in disparities for a purpose—one that I trust makes perfect sense” he said explaining that “someone probably would have done something about it” otherwise. “In fact I would go so far as to presume that for some reason or another these people do not deserve the same personal professional and monetary leg up that I’ve had every step of the way. It’s just common sense.”Though the Claremont McKenna College graduate conceded he cannot remember doing anything that would warrant him receiving the helpful connections with others in high places the fast track to professional advancement and the plain old social standing that have allowed him to pursue his happiness unimpeded he remarked that he is not the only one to have been afforded such benefits. Indeed he pointed to numerous similarly advantaged individuals around him whose situations he has deduced must also be justified.“Most of my friends and coworkers seem to be pretty well set as far as being successful and fulfilled goes so society must have decided they deserve it too” Naylor said. “And come to think of it everyone in my family also has a pretty easy life. It’s been that way for generations actually.”“And unless something changes my plan is to just keep going with it” he added. “I guess it’s possible things could be different someday but I kind of doubt it.”

I’d follow her home find out where she lives and come back the next day to throw acid in her face. Nowadays I’m more likely to just shake my head and go on with my day. I don’t blow a gasket like I used to.”“Do I still want to unleash ceaseless death and destruction upon the infidels in the name of Allah?” he added. “Absolutely. But I’ve learned to pick my battles.”Kalmati explained to reporters that as he’s grown older he’s begun to realize that life is too short to spend an entire day disemboweling a teacher for the offense of educating girls or publicly flogging a woman seen walking with a man who isn’t a relative—things he has reportedly done in the past without hesitation.Now that he’s reached middle age the Islamist operative said he is also less inclined to react violently when coming across Pashtuns who embrace elements of American culture a far cry from when he was younger and once shot the entire staff of a local movie theater execution-style for screening a Hollywood film.“There comes a point when you realize you can’t just furiously obsess over every little transgression of your literal interpretation of the Prophet’s teachings—otherwise you’ll just be miserable all the time” said Kalmati pointing to past instances in which he “got very heated admittedly” and dragged men accused of homosexuality into the streets stripped them naked and stoned them to death. “Many years ago I kidnapped and beheaded a journalist with a group of older mujahideen who hardly seemed to take any pleasure in the act at all. I remember thinking ‘I’ll never be like that.’ But now that I’m their age I completely get where they were coming from.”“I’m a bit more laid-back these days and it takes a lot to get me riled up enough to pack a car full of explosives and remotely detonate it in a crowded urban bazaar” he continued. “It still happens every once in a while but not as often as it used to.”While acknowledging that the thought of male doctors treating female patients will still on occasion cause him to erupt in a fit of anger and burn down a public hospital Kalmati explained that he now focuses more time and energy on his personal hobbies which include cooking and photography.The aging zealot stressed that his desire to cleanse the world of all infidels—even if it means massacring fellow Muslims who aren’t strictly devout or who practice Shi’a Islam—remains as strong as ever. But he noted he is far happier now that his entire emotional state no longer revolves solely around that end.“You get married you have a few kids and eventually you realize you no longer want to go out at night to ransack a Christian bookstore and slit the owner’s throat in front of his family” Kalmati said. “But that’s okay.”“When you look at the kinds of things the young jihadists are doing today you realize the torch has been passed” he added. “What they’re doing goes way beyond anything we ever even dreamed of.”
2014-11-13T09:54:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/astronomers-discover-planet-identical-to-earth-with-orb-1819577220,Astronomers Discover Planet Identical To Earth With Orbital Space Mirror,WASHINGTON—In what many are hailing as the most significant development in the history of space exploration NASA scientists announced Thursday that a planet seemingly identical to Earth has been discovered by the agency’s Orbital Space Mirror.According to NASA the $2.9 billion aluminum glass mirror which stretches over 180 feet wide and 147 feet tall has already produced invaluable data suggesting that our solar system may contain a terrestrial planet of the exact same size shape and surface composition as Earth.“This is a historic moment for humankind to confirm the existence of another planet that is almost indistinguishable from our own” said mission leader Allen Brugel who explained that after releasing the Orbital Mirror from a Delta IV heavy rocket at an operational altitude of 104000 miles the team received almost instantaneous images of an Earth-like planet approximately 208000 miles away. “It is remarkable to find another celestial body where water is not only present but also covers two-thirds of the planet’s entire surface. What may be even more surprising is that it was discovered in a part of space that was previously thought to be completely empty.”“It turns out that in a universe that’s 93 billion light years wide a planet perfectly suited for human life was right next to us in our own solar system” Brugel added.Built by NASA as part of a program created to identify planets in the galaxy capable of sustaining life sources confirmed the orbiting plane mirror has provided scientists with continuous real-time reflections of light rays since its launch in late October.Scientists cited numerous key similarities between the newly discovered planet and our own including the celestial body’s landmasses oceans wind patterns cloud formations apparent vegetation and set of polar ice caps that strikingly resemble those found on Earth. Sources added that NASA’s preliminary surveys indicate that the recently detected body even completes one full rotation in approximately 24 hours and that even more remarkably its axial tilt is believed to also be exactly 23.5 degrees.NASA scientists added that the new planet also possesses a single moon though they noted that it appears to orbit and rotate in the complete opposite direction as Earth’s.“Perhaps most fascinating is the significant amount of evidence indicating that sentient life may already be present on this new planet” said Brugel noting that portions of the planet’s surface are illuminated by artificial light at night a phenomenon scientists say is most prevalent in the planet’s northern hemisphere. “We suspect they may be a significantly advanced society as our mirror imaging system confirms that there are numerous sophisticated satellites circling the planet.”“Beyond that we can only begin to speculate what types of beings such a planet could produce” he added.According to sources a recent unmanned mission to land on the body’s surface was aborted after discovering that life forms on the planet had launched a probe traveling at the same speed on a flight path identical to that of the NASA team. Internal NASA reports indicate that a potential head-on collision was narrowly avoided when both crafts simultaneously changed course at the last second.“Overall we’re pleased with our initial findings and I believe the project has made excellent use of the lessons learned from the Helios Space Lens” said Brugel referring to an ill-fated mission in 1992 to provide advanced imaging of the sun using convex lens technology an experiment which burned down NASA headquarters. “And after further studying deep space via the Orbital Mirror we also determined that the universe appears to be perfectly symmetrical a shocking finding that challenges all of our previously held theories.”At press time NASA had reportedly launched its Orbital Space Mirror 2 to the side of Earth opposite that of its original Orbital Space Mirror leading scientists to conclude that there may actually be an infinite number of Earth-like planets stretching outward forever in a straight line through space.

I swear sometimes we have silent mechanical sex three even four times a day now.”“Periodically checking that calendar and feeling like I absolutely must have Jon ejaculate inside me before my unfertilized egg disintegrates is enough to get our most erotic impulses running on overdrive” she continued. “It’s like we’re on our honeymoon all over again.”The Nickoloffs characterized the past few months in which their moments of intimacy have been dictated solely according to the fluctuations of Sarah’s estrogen levels as “completely mind-blowing” claiming that their sizzling strictly regimented intercourse leaves both of them perpetually turned on overwhelmed with lust and begging for more.Specifically the married couple pointed to such “hot and heavy” aspects of their reinvigorated sex life as obsessing over the consistency of Sarah’s vaginal discharge in order to capitalize on those periods in which her cervical mucus is most conducive to sperm motility. They added that they have been brought to the dizzying pinnacle of sexual euphoria each and every time one of Sarah’s Clearblue urinary tests detects the peak luteinizing hormone levels that prompt their rote erotic escapades.“Oh my God there’s absolutely nothing hotter than hearing the fertility tracker app on my iPhone chime during the day reminding me to have sex as soon as I get back to the condo after picking up groceries and stopping by the bank” said Sarah who added that she can always unleash the inner sexual beast in her husband by frustratedly pointing down at her watch and telling him they have to have sex now so that he has an adequate refractory period before they make themselves engage in the act a second time later that same evening. “Just talking about categorizing my cervical fluid as either creamy or watery estimating its volume and then entering that data into an automated matrix to predict my upcoming fertile days makes me want to rush home and ride Jon all night long.”“Let me tell you squeezing tired dispirited bouts of sex into the evenings during the middle of a busy workweek when both of us are annoyed and exhausted—it’s the best sex of my life” she added. “Mmm I’m getting flush just thinking about it.”When reached for comment Jon admitted that it takes every ounce of restraint for him not to tear his wife’s clothes off throw her onto their bed and have his way with her every time he walks into their shared bathroom to find her taking her basal temperature vaginally in order to assess whether it’s high enough to merit that they have sex or if he should refrain from wasting his semen.“I’ve always enjoyed sex but our new routine of emotionlessly lumbering through intercourse aiming for as quick a climax as possible and then having me roll to the other side of the mattress so that Sarah can prop up her hips with a pillow in hopes that my ejaculate will stay inside her long enough to yield a fertilized ovum has opened up a whole new world of sexual ecstasy to both of us” said Jon 38 noting that he never realized how uninhibited sex could be until he set his alarm clock to wake him and his wife up early in the morning so they could engage in drowsy intercourse before going into work always making sure to forgo lubricant in order to avoid killing any sperm cells. “Just coaxing out one more paltry orgasm knowing that if I fail to impregnate her this time we’ll have to wait another three weeks before making another attempt makes me feel like a caged animal in heat. It’s really spiced things up to say the least.”“And at this rate it looks like this is something that we’ll be able to enjoy for years to come” he added.
2014-10-31T13:33:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/report-80-of-all-traffic-accidents-caused-by-drivers-1819577140,Report: 80% Of All Traffic Accidents Caused By Drivers Gawking At Shirtless Hunks,WASHINGTON—Signaling an alarming and dangerous trend for the nation’s motorists the U.S. Department of Transportation released a report Friday revealing that four out of five traffic accidents are caused by drivers taking their eyes off the road to ogle shirtless hunks.The report confirmed that in 2013 more than 7 million passenger cars and light trucks were involved in minor collisions rollovers and multi-vehicle accidents that resulted from drivers who were distracted by checking out the taut and tanned muscles of gorgeous young studs.“Our data indicates that gawking at the washboard abs of a grade-A beefcake jogging on the sidewalk even for just a few seconds dramatically increases the likelihood of driver error and crash risk” said DOT spokesperson Hugh Tucker noting that looking in the side mirror for another quick peek at a smoking hot landscaper wiping sweat from his brow was the country’s leading cause of rear-end crashes. “Unfortunately many motorists assume they can safely gape at bare-chested man-meat but the sight of perfectly chiseled pectoral muscles glistening in the sun can often prove to be so mesmerizing that drivers don’t look away before drifting into another lane of traffic.”“When you turn your attention away from steering to rubberneck at a totally ripped dreamboat you are needlessly endangering yourself and everyone on the road” added Tucker.According to the Department of Transportation approximately 7000 drivers per day do a double take of a bronze-skinned hunk’s rock-hard torso bite their lip and then mouth the words “oh my” as they carelessly swerve into a guardrail or over a curb. In addition the use of a handheld device to shoot a quick photo of a mouth-watering studmuffin’s broad rippling shoulders has contributed to 20 percent of all accidents reported to police.Experts stressed that certain stretches of road can prove especially dangerous particularly in summer months when strapping heartthrobs with firm bods are more likely to forgo a shirt while mowing the lawn or playing football with a group of equally buff hotties.“Areas with a high density of muscular eye candy are quite treacherous—traffic generally slows down to take a good look at sinewy Adonises along running routes or near construction sites and it often leads to a lot of congestion and fender benders” said highway safety advocate George Proval. “That intersection at Muscle Beach in Santa Monica is essentially a death trap.”“I’ve personally seen a number of multiple-car pileups that were the direct result of drivers craning their necks to bask in the full glory of a brawny hunk spotting for another waxed oiled-up slab of manflesh pumping iron” he added.Proval cautioned that when motorists encounter a delectable musclebound looker they should immediately pull over to the curb or highway shoulder stop the vehicle and drink in every square inch of the powerful hard-bodied stud before proceeding to their destination.Topeka KS resident Lauren Hyde told reporters she learned firsthand that in just the short span of time it takes to get an eyeful of a tantalizing powerfully built hunk wringing out a soapy sponge control of the vehicle has already been lost.“I was driving over to my sister’s place a few months ago when I noticed a unit of volunteer firefighters holding a carwash fundraiser” said Hyde who was recently involved in a collision after her sedan spun out across the median into oncoming traffic. “The last thing I remember was saying ‘Come to mama’ and then I woke up in a hospital bed.”“I keep replaying that moment over and over in my head” Hyde continued. “I just wish I could have gotten one more glance at his sexy six-pack.”
2014-10-30T11:10:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/thrill-seeking-man-wonders-how-long-he-can-keep-up-dang-1819577134,Thrill-Seeking Man Wonders How Long He Can Keep Up Dangerous Sedentary Lifestyle,PHOENIX—Acknowledging that it’s only a matter of time before his high-risk pursuits finally catch up to him local thrill-seeker Daniel Erickson told reporters Wednesday that he often wonders just how long he can keep up his extremely hazardous sedentary lifestyle.The 36-year-old IT specialist said that while he lives for the exhilarating danger that comes from spending nearly every waking hour sitting at his computer watching television or playing with his smartphone in bed he is fully aware that he is balancing on the razor’s edge with each passing virtually immobile day.“I’m skating on thin ice living my life like this but chasing after those extreme risks is just in my blood” said Erickson who noted that spending the vast majority of his time in a slumped or fully recumbent position is all part of the nonstop game of chance that he thrives on. “I know that if I keep tempting fate by stretching out on the sofa all day I’ll eventually pay the price but I’m not someone who can do things halfway. If I’m going to play with fire by lying across those cushions every chance I get then I’ve got to go all out with as little bodily movement as possible. That’s just the way I am.”“A lot of people want to play it safe by engaging in some kind of physical activity every now and then” he continued. “Not me though. I live for the rush.”The adventure-seeker told reporters that getting absolutely no aerobic exercise has been a part of his devil-may-care attitude for most of his life adding that he has been “pressing [his] luck” with prolonged periods of idleness for as long as he can remember.Erickson explained that he continues to “roll the dice” in search of thrills on a daily basis from his office job where he pushes himself to the limit by staring at the same screen for eight or more hours every day to his domestic life in which he ignores grave perils each night by sinking into his recliner with a box of Cheez-Its and remaining there virtually motionless long into the evening.According to Erickson he must constantly raise the stakes on his daredevil behavior to achieve the same pleasurable sensations he used to feel. The local man told reporters that he is now kicking back with his legs up on his coffee table or lying in his backyard hammock for longer periods of time than ever before in search of a greater and greater high.“When I started out I would take an occasional exhilarating midday nap but I would always pull back from the edge by walking around the neighborhood or doing a little bit of yard work every so often. Now though that won’t cut it—I have to keep taking things to the next level” said Erickson noting that he is no longer content with spending merely four or five hours playing Xbox or watching only a portion of a daylong Breaking Bad marathon. “The thing is sitting there for just the standard 8 p.m.-to-midnight block of primetime television just doesn’t carry the risk I need to get my adrenaline flowing anymore. Now I’m pushing myself further than I’ve ever gone before sometimes confining myself to the same spot on the couch for 16 hours at a time.”As he continues to push the envelope with his increasingly dangerous sedentary behavior Erickson readily admitted that he is putting his well-being at risk conceding that his pulse-pounding stationary lifestyle might end up seriously hurting him one day or even sending him to an early grave.“My girlfriend gets worried sick every time she sees me go out to the den with snacks in hand and then not come back for half a day or more” said Erickson adding that he is fully aware that he can only engage in the intoxicating thrill of spending an entire weekend watching multiple full seasons of a TV show on Netflix so many times before he winds up in the hospital. “And believe me I realize that I’m walking a dangerous line every time I get my lunch order delivered straight to my cubicle or spend my entire Saturday lounging against my bed’s headboard reading back issues of Ultimate X-Men on my iPad. But taking these kinds of crazy risks is just part of who I am and there’s no changing that.”“Maybe I’m putting my life in jeopardy living the way I do” he continued. “But I want to spend what time I have on earth doing what I love.”
2014-10-28T14:05:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/report-79-of-world-s-attics-remain-unexplored-1819577115,Report: 79% Of World’s Attics Remain Unexplored,ITHACA NY—Describing the vast undisturbed regions as one of the last true frontiers on the planet a report published Tuesday by researchers at Cornell University has found that at least 79 percent of the world’s attic space remains unexplored.According to the report the little-understood lofted areas of most homes across the globe have not been studied beyond a radius of approximately an arm’s length from their entrance hatches leaving what remains in their further reaches a matter of pure speculation.“Apart from a small region illuminated by a single pull-chain light bulb we know very little about attics” said the report’s lead author professor Neal Hutchison noting a lack of data on both the size and contents of the elevated enclosures. “While we suspect that some form of insulation could exist up there perhaps along a wall or the roofline we haven’t yet been able to travel far enough inside to confirm or deny that.”“Right now most of our explorations involve climbing up a stepladder or the built-in pull-down stairs quickly poking our head inside and returning with almost no new information” Hutchison continued. “Even after all these years of retrieving Christmas tree stands from right inside the entryway the darkest recesses of our world’s attics remain a complete mystery to us.”Though for years researchers have embarked on specialized missions by shining flashlights into attics and waving them around in different directions the report stated they have never penetrated more than a few feet beyond the already well-documented zone near the top of the stairs.Many past expeditions into the deeper recesses of uncharted attics have reportedly been forced to turn back due to dust poor ventilation and evidence of potential spiders. Sources confirmed a recent attempt to explore an unmapped Plano TX attic encountered an old crib but the mission was aborted due to atmospheric conditions described as “thick” and “musty.”“Are there board games up there? Maybe old baby clothes?” said Hutchison who mentioned a colleague’s hypothesis that Dad’s bowling trophy may reside in a remote corner of the attic. “Can fabrics made of natural fibers even survive in such harsh moth-infested conditions? Ultimately gaps in our knowledge will continue to exist until we dust off and open some of these boxes that appear to have been taped shut decades ago.”“Attic exploration will remain at a standstill until we develop the capacity to stoop down beneath a low ceiling lantern in hand to see if the good family china is back there somewhere” Hutchison added.Hutchison told reporters that attic research has lagged far behind comparable studies into the world’s cellars and basements which in recent generations have been found to contain gardening tools bicycles in a state of disrepair and the trunk with the winter bedding. The researcher remarked that these better-understood spaces often hold items with potential resale value such as skis and that some had even been developed into finished rec rooms.“One is tempted to ask whether our attics too could be colonized perhaps made into an apartment that could be rented out to provide some extra income” Hutchison said. “There may be valuable resources hidden above our heads right now but unfortunately all we do when we’re up there is pick up a couple things carefully put them back and then wipe our dust-covered hands on our pants before heading back downstairs.”“Of course attic research comes with a very unique set of challenges” he continued. “There are gaps between the beams up there and all it takes is one false step for a foot to go through the ceiling and for research to be set back another five years.”

He also explained that customers are free to roam both the ship’s upper and lower decks allowing them to get the best view of the whales’ crumpled bodies.The captain cautioned however that the tour may not be ideal for those who are easily made seasick.“It’s always a special moment to watch our passengers’ eyes light up when they see their first whale struck head-on and then get dragged underneath the boat” McDermott said. “Sometimes we’ll come upon a mother nursing her calf and we’ll max the engines to take them both out in one charge and on other days we’ll get really lucky and a whale will spout its blood right onto the deck. It’s a new experience every time.”“These animals are so magnificent” he continued. “Everyone owes it to themselves to see them now before they’re gone forever.”

With the unharvestable corn growing through asphalt roadways and airport tarmacs all over the Midwest FEMA has been leading efforts to evacuate millions of residents before the plants obstruct all travel in the central United States.“This particular strain of Monsanto corn is advancing at an alarming rate and all efforts to contain the aggressive infestation have thus far been unsuccessful” said Deputy Secretary of Agriculture Krysta Harden who confirmed that the bioengineered crop thrives even in inhospitable environments and threatens entire ecosystems through rapid colonization and domination of native vegetation. “At this rate we are facing a catastrophic level of growth. The corn has spread quickly from farms overwhelming small towns and suburban neighborhoods and is now starting to encroach upon highly populated cities.”“We’re dealing with a virtually indestructible corn plant that faces no natural competition and can take hold and flourish on any available surface” added Harden. “At this point the stretch of land from Minnesota to Arkansas has almost been completely consumed by this agribusiness product.”According to accounts hundreds of farmers throughout the region have been forced to abandon tractors and agriculture equipment in fields overgrown with the robust crop. Despite efforts by the USDA to halt the crop’s expansion using high-concentration herbicides chemical treatments of the region’s soil and controlled fires thick rows of the corn—officially known by the Monsanto product ID MON915—have continued to overtake farmland forests parks and both commercial and residential properties.Officials confirmed that the highly resilient corn is composed of a Monsanto-patented steel-like plant fiber creating an unbreakable stalk and an impenetrable husk that is impossible to open or separate from the rest of the organism. In addition sources confirmed that the corn’s roots become too firmly embedded in the bedrock to remove the plant from the soil.“This genetically modified corn is so dense in places that it has rendered many towns in the Midwest completely inaccessible” said Harden warning that the corn which was carefully engineered in Monsanto’s St. Louis laboratories was rapidly draining the nutrients from the soil and depleting the region’s groundwater. “By our estimates the crop is now consuming 100 acres of land per hour and is likely to completely cut off the Omaha metropolitan area by month’s end.”“Unfortunately the start of colder weather hasn’t slowed this bioengineered corn at all” added Harden. “It’s too hardy.”Following its introduction during the 2013 agricultural season the corn has ravaged natural habitats by crowding out local wildlife’s food sources and clogging major waterways including the Missouri and Mississippi rivers with its dense root systems. In recent weeks experts expressed concerns about the humanitarian crisis caused by the crop’s unrelenting expansion which has forced the populations of Columbia MO Carbondale IL Ames IA and several other cities to abandon their homes.“The corn started inching in on the outskirts of town about four months ago” said Columbia MO resident Carla Tanner who was forced to evacuate with her family of four after numerous stalks of the bio-patented crop burst through her home’s floorboards compromising several of the load-bearing elements in the building and making the structure unsafe for habitation. “None of us expected the corn to grow so fast and so thick. By the time we left you could hardly see from one side of Main Street to the other for all the stalks.”“There is no Columbia anymore” Tanner continued. “It’s all just corn.”At press time the Monsanto Company had announced plans to bring legal action against the 65 million people of the Midwest for growing patented genetic material without paying the company’s seed premium.

Komen Foundation Launches Deep Space Probe To Bring Breast Cancer Awareness To Rest Of Galaxy,DALLAS—In what is being hailed as its single most ambitious messaging campaign to date the Susan G. Komen foundation announced Thursday it had launched its first deep space probe part of an effort to bring increased breast cancer awareness to the farthest reaches of the galaxy.Shortly after the morning liftoff Komen officials told reporters they expect the vessel which they have christened the Outreach to promote regular screenings and education initiatives across the entire 120000-light-year span of the Milky Way.The organization confirmed it had raised $1.3 billion to build the probe approximately one quarter of which went toward painting the spacecraft pink adding specialized pink fixtures to its interior and outfitting its hull with glowing pink lights.“I couldn’t be more excited to be standing here on this historic day when we take the fight against breast cancer to the outer limits of our solar system and beyond” said the group’s founder and chair of global strategy Nancy Brinker speaking at a post-launch gala held on the 1400-acre campus of the new state-of-the-art Susan G. Komen Space Center. “Thanks to so many generous donations and 5K charity run-walks our new Outreach probe will ensure no being in the galaxy remains unaware of this deadly disease.”“The vast unexplored regions of deep space may contain life that simply doesn’t know how vital it is to get a mammogram at least once every Earth year” Brinker continued. “But together we can change that.”According to officials the Outreach is equipped with an array of highly advanced instruments for relaying the message that early detection is key to survival as well as details on how to host your own “Passionately Pink” fundraiser for the organization.Additionally the probe’s sweep frequency transmission system emits modulated radio pulses that reportedly spell out “We Are Fearless” “Make Your Impact” and others of Susan G. Komen’s various trademarked slogans in all known languages in addition to communicating details of the organization’s latest efforts to increase visibility through corporate brand partnerships.The probe which is propelled by its twin “Pink Power” ion thrusters is said to travel at a relative velocity of 24 kilometers per second and is projected to reach the edge of the heliosphere by approximately 2039 at which point it will become the first human-made object to broadcast inspirational survivor stories and common early breast cancer warning signs into interstellar space.“Even after the Outreach drifts past the Kuiper Belt and beyond the gravitational bounds of our sun we’ll still be able to transmit updated photos of celebrity chefs participating in our ‘Cook For The Cure’ program to its high-frequency antennae” mission flight director Kenneth Harrison said. “Whenever the probe comes within range of any star its solar-powered transmitters will automatically send out the message that more than 1000 breast cancer screenings are made possible each day by a Susan G. Komen community grant and that attending a three-day walkathon where everyone camps out in matching pink tents can help end breast cancer forever.”“This is the message that will eventually reach an estimated 200 billion stars and their planets” Harrison added. “It’s incredibly exciting.”Harrison went on to state that in order to communicate with any potential intelligent life forms that may have breast tissue the Outreach features a pink stainless steel plaque with binary-based engravings indicating that one in eight human women born today will be diagnosed with breast cancer and offering step-by-step instructions on how to perform a breast self-examination.Sources confirmed that the probe’s cargo hold is filled with shirts hats stickers coffee mugs key chains and various other Susan G. Komen–branded merchandise which are packaged in hundreds of “gift capsules” that will be periodically jettisoned into space during the journey.“It’s humbling to know that even after we lose radio contact with the probe it will continue spreading awareness for eons long after we’re gone” said Brinker who explained that the Outreach probe builds on the successes of the organization’s Sea Pink project a deep-sea submersible that has been trawling trenches of the ocean floor emitting sonar messages about the disease since 2010. “With ambitious projects like these we can finally make certain everyone in the universe is aware of breast cancer.”“And because 44 cents of every dollar we spend goes toward such endeavors your continued support is as important as ever” Brinker added.

That’s a large burden on their parents.”“More Americans are planning ahead now so they’ll be ready when their kids grow up and head off into a workforce that can’t absorb their numbers” she added.The report also found that the average parent begins saving earlier now than in the past often before a child is even born making an effort to deposit a small portion of each paycheck tax refund or holiday bonus into an account specifically designated for their son or daughter’s unemployment.While many young adults are eligible to receive federal aid for their joblessness sources said outside assistance of this kind only covers a small part of the total cost leaving parents to pick up the remainder of what can be a very substantial tab.“A lot of people wait too long to start saving and before they know it their children’s unemployment is upon then” said Scott Rosen a Philadelphia-based financial adviser. “At that point it’s too late and they find they can’t afford it. It’s important not to underestimate the strain your jobless kids can place on your finances. Starting your child’s unemployment savings now is the only way to ensure you’ll be able to cope when the costs start piling up.”“The annual bill can be enormous especially when a child is unemployed out of state” he added.Numerous parents reached for comment told reporters they were making sacrifices now in the hopes they won’t find themselves strapped for cash when their children get older and are unable to find work with many admitting to putting off family vacations purchasing more economical cars and discontinuing dining out.“Now that my son is out of the house desperately searching for a job and having no luck I’m really glad we put aside all that money” said Karen Franklin a 41-year-old mother from San Diego. “My husband and I took great pains to make sure our kids would have an easier time than we did when we were young and unemployed. Things are more expensive now but hopefully we’ll be able to cover him for the first year or two.”“My parents didn’t save any money for my unemployment and when it finally arrived things were really really hard” she continued. “The truth is I’m still paying off the debts I took on during my own jobless years.”

Yeah I think I can handle that kind of stuff for the official three-year mourning period.” At press time the nation’s populace was trying to mentally work themselves up to don their official mourning jumpsuits and participate in a countrywide somber dance routine.

Additionally White House officials noted that passengers would be able to travel between Tokyo and Osaka in just two and a half hours following their 10 or more hours of plane travel.Sources confirmed that the new system would also be far more environmentally sound than current transportation methods as Americans would no longer have to depend on fuel-intensive smog-producing automobiles or buses and could instead travel across the landscape of a different continent in comfort aboard the rail system’s fully electric and “whisper-quiet” train cars.“Imagine stretching out in a spacious berth in a sleek 16-car Hikari train following a quick red-eye from O’Hare LAX or LaGuardia” Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx told reporters noting that travelers will have the option of either purchasing individual tickets for the kakueki teisha trains or acquiring a 21-day unlimited pass for approximately 60000 yen. “Any American citizen who wants to experience the ease of high-speed rail travel and who has an up-to-date passport and an English-Japanese phrase book will be able to fly straight to Japan to do so.”Thousands of commuters confirmed that they have already booked their overseas plane tickets in order to take advantage of punctual frequent rail service between major Japanese cities hailing the new system as a welcome alternative to the stress and waste of existing U.S. transportation methods.“Around here we don’t have that many dependable mass transit choices so I’m excited about trying out these new trains once I can get a few days off from work and take a flight over” said Cincinnati resident Christopher Thomas. “Now there’s nothing stopping me from packing a suitcase hopping on a 747 and after filling out and submitting an official declaration form upon arrival taking a train absolutely anywhere I want within the country.”“It’s great” he added. “I’m just glad the U.S. finally decided to invest in our future and make high-speed rail travel a reality.”

But the unfortunate reality is that a sucker punch can strike anyone at any time without warning and it can be one of the most awful events of one’s life often leaving victims doubled over and grimacing for minutes on end.”“That is why it’s absolutely crucial that citizens develop a comprehensive preparedness and recovery action plan immediately” she continued. “Because by the time someone slugs you in the belly it’s already too late.”Burwell stated that it was critical for citizens of all ages and backgrounds to understand the dangers of taking one right in the breadbasket and noted that the agency was stepping up its efforts to provide information to citizens on how to protect themselves. First and foremost Burwell said citizens must stay informed about any person who might be poised to wing around and sock them in the first place. Additionally she stressed that Americans should heed all credible warnings from anyone who threatens to whale on them and instructed U.S. residents to make all efforts to get away from a potential jab to the abdomen or solar plexus before it can inflict any damage.However should any American find him or herself in the unavoidable path of a sucker punch according to Burwell that person should make an effort to shield the vulnerable midsection by any means necessary typically by clenching one’s abdominal muscles and gritting one’s teeth. Burwell stressed that citizens should then wait it out in place advising individuals to hold their aching stomach and call the puncher a “fucking dick” until help arrives.“We want people to recognize that this is a problem that needs to be taken seriously. The last thing you should do is ignore the possibility of a sucker punch and turn your back on the situation” Burwell said. “As that just leaves you exposed to a swift clock right to the back of the head.”While HHS officials called the study’s results “worrisome” and “disconcerting” they noted that their findings were in line with other recent reports including a 2011 survey that classified over half of Americans as “highly vulnerable” to being cold-cocked in the jaw and found that some 71 percent of citizens were entirely unprepared for a firm knee to the tailbone.Moreover a FEMA study from last year reportedly found that as many as nine in 10 Americans had no plan in place should someone get down on all fours immediately behind them as a second individual pushed them backward.“We hope that through education Americans can learn to recognize the risks posed by sucker punches and take the necessary safety measures to ensure they are sufficiently prepared should the unthinkable happen” said Burwell noting that for many Americans it wasn’t a question of if they would be sucker punched but when. “If you recognize a sucker punch early enough there’s a good chance you can dodge the blow entirely and come back with a haymaker or a full nelson of your own.”“We will never be able to fully stop sucker punches from happening” she continued. “But as long as everyone is properly prepared it’s possible that in the future no American will be left sputtering and gasping on the floor in the fetal position.”
2014-10-03T11:15:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/pfizer-releases-vintage-cask-aged-robitussin-1819577005,Pfizer Releases Vintage Cask-Aged Robitussin,GROTON CT—Touting the new offering’s full-bodied flavor and bold fruit-forward bouquet pharmaceutical giant Pfizer unveiled a vintage cask-aged variety of its popular cold medicine Robitussin on Friday.Labeled as Robitussin Reserve the high-end over-the-counter cough remedy is reportedly being marketed toward a more affluent segment of consumers with acute upper respiratory symptoms. Company officials confirmed the select Cough & Cold blend has been prepared in a limited run of 100 barrels and retails for $39.95 a bottle.“This is an upscale product for the cold and flu sufferer with a discerning palate” said Pfizer spokesman Mark Dumont who went on to describe Robitussin Reserve as a premium version of the classic medication one that effectively relieves the toughest chest congestion with “a delicate smoothness and complex aromatics.” “This fine vintage provides multi-symptom relief while satisfying the tastes of even the most refined connoisseur. It is well-balanced elegant and loosens phlegm and mucus with minimal drowsiness.”“You’re going to want to save this Robitussin for a very special cold” Dumont continued. “We recommend pairing it with soup saltines and plenty of fluids.”According to company sources the superior-blend DXM-based cough suppressant is produced exclusively in the East Brunswick region of New Jersey—an area long known for its world-class medications—where master manufacturers on the sprawling Pfizer grounds are said to hand-select only “the finest available” industrial-grade pharmaceutical ingredients.Though officials would not release the details of their proprietary maturation process they confirmed that each batch is aged in French oak casks and stored at cool temperatures in the manufacturing plant’s basement cellar a technique thought to enrich the dextromethorphan hydrobromide’s taste profile before bottling.With its intense ruby color and syrupy-thick mouthfeel the new maximum-strength vintage is said to be redolent of mixed berries and eucalyptus with strong notes of cherry an assertive nose of honey-lemon and a lingering medicinal finish. Pfizer representatives stated that a P.M. varietal is in the works for next year’s bottling.“Robitussin Reserve is our most exciting release this flu season” said Pfizer pharmacologist Anne Tomlinson who recommended removing the cap and allowing the liquid to aerate for 30 minutes prior to consumption in order to properly activate the decongestants. “But you may not want to uncap it right away. This is a bottle many will choose to age longer in their medicine cabinets perhaps saving it for the wedding day of a son or daughter with a bad case of bronchitis.”Packaged in a dark green bottle that prevents damaging sunlight from breaking down the desirable allergy-blocking properties of its antihistamines the vintage Robitussin comes with a stemmed plastic dosing cup in which Tomlinson encouraged tasters to swirl the medication in order to release its characteristic aroma.She added that examining “the legs” of the cough syrup could reveal a lot about the drug’s binding and thickening agents as well as showcase its brilliant FD&C Red No. 40 dye content.“My wife and I were celebrating our anniversary last night while fighting off nagging colds so we decided to try Robitussin Reserve” said Gary Hutchinson of Darien CT who picked up a bottle of the top-shelf vintage at a nearby Rite Aid. “We cracked it open said a toast and then really savored it. It definitely has much more depth and complexity than the cheaper bottles I used to buy. And it really took the edge off my cold.”“It’s pretty strong though” he added. “I had a bit too much and passed right out.”

You can tell the manufacturing sector is really hurting.”“And with all its plants mills and factories shutting down it looks like it’s finally ready to pass on” added West. “I just want to offer my support in these last few precious moments.”The U.S. populace confirmed that they would always have fond recollections of the period in the 1940s and ’50s when the manufacturing industry was full of energy and vitality. However the nation acknowledged that the sector had turned into a shell of its former self in the decades since growing ever more feeble and significantly slowing down to the point where it could barely handle producing household appliances anymore.Millions of Americans reportedly expressed their wish to turn the clock back for a final glimpse at “the good old days” when the industry’s car assembly plants in Detroit were operating at full capacity with thousands of skilled laborers pouring into factory doors every morning. Others told reporters that just seeing smoke pouring out of a Pennsylvania steel mill’s flue one last time would be enough to remind them of how strong and vibrant the economic sector once was.However nearly all U.S. citizens admitted that this was only wishful thinking given the aging sector’s rapid downturn since 2007 saying they’d recently realized that all they could hope for was to have “a few nice moments” before the inevitable occurs.“I have all these wonderful memories from back when the conveyor belts were constantly running shifts were working around the clock and it seemed like the manufacturing sector was just so full of life but now I can barely recognize it at all” said Alison Panetta of Akron OH explaining that she now simply wanted to make sure she said her farewells on her own terms. “At this point I’ve accepted that it isn’t going to get any better. I just want to enjoy what little time we still have left.”“I made the mistake of not doing that with the family farming sector and I’m not going to make it again” Panetta added.According to sources many Americans admitted that they had been in denial for years about the manufacturing sector’s decline and nearly all citizens expressed regret that they hadn’t stopped and truly cherished the plastics transportation equipment machinery and electronics industries when they were in their prime.“You look at the way it’s struggling with something as simple as textiles these days and it seems like it could slip away at any minute” said Kyle Dunham of Manassas VA. “It’s so tough to see the manufacturing industry this way especially knowing how much we all used to rely on it but there’s just no getting around the harsh truth.”“More than anything I just hope the sector goes quickly” Dunham added. “It’s time for the pain and suffering to end.”

Not by a long shot.”“Our statistical models predicted they would all be long gone by now” he continued. “But these suckers just keep hanging on. Every couple years we check and they’re still fucking there. It’s unbelievable.”While population estimates indicate that the fish’s numbers are not as high as they used to be scientists confirmed that the aquatic creatures are nonetheless flourishing like you would not goddamn believe. Additionally researchers acknowledged that even though pollution from fertilizers pesticides and wastewater is helping to kill off the reefs upon which parrotfish depend for survival these resilient foot-long fuckers can still be found scraping by throughout the Indo-Pacific and Caribbean regions.According to marine scientists you would think that widespread habitat destruction—a phenomenon that only took a couple decades to absolutely obliterate the now-extinct Tecopa pupfish—would have put the parrotfish out of commission too but nope it sure hasn’t.“Seriously what’s it going to take to kill these things?” said Norse who explained that parrotfish must have some serious balls to have survived the devastating effects of global warming and ocean acidification. “Every piece of evidence we have suggests they should be belly-up washing up on the goddamn shore. Years back we looked at these fish—which by the way don’t even have the benefit of protected status—and immediately thought ‘Okay these guys are goners.’ Seemed like a no-brainer you know?”“Well don’t we look like a bunch of idiots now?” he added. “I gotta hand it to ’em though. They’re persistent little shits.”At press time scientists confirmed that despite the rising sea levels marine debris industrial effluents climate stress natural predation and hurricanes those little cocksuckers are still plugging right along and will probably outlive us all.
2014-09-25T11:13:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/nation-admits-it-could-probably-be-talked-into-another-1819576965,Nation Admits It Could Probably Be Talked Into Another War,WASHINGTON—While they acknowledged that getting behind such a plan might take a little convincing the American populace admitted this week that they could in all likelihood be talked into another war.Citizens across the nation told reporters that at present they do not want the country to be involved in a foreign conflict but given the right combination of reassuring political rhetoric and reasonably conclusive evidence they could definitely see themselves getting on board with the idea and supporting a large-scale military engagement sometime in the near future.“Another war definitely isn’t my first choice but if the president made a nationally televised address in which he looked directly into the camera and said that swift action against a brutal foreign regime must be taken then sure I might go for that” said Minneapolis resident Elizabeth Compton who noted that if the nation’s top leaders stated it would be a limited operation and would be led by a coalition of some sort then she would be willing to hear them out at the very least. “In fact as long as the president referred to it as a noble cause and mentioned something about protecting American interests or preserving the principles of democracy around the world I think I could certainly come around to it.”“And assuming he used a firm tone of voice and had an assured look on his face while talking about the U.S.’s moral obligation to oppressed peoples then yeah” she continued “I’d say that would probably seal the deal.”Although they agreed it would likely take several days in which they heard various permutations of the sentiment that we have to take the fighting to them before they can take it home to us the nation’s 317 million citizens said they could definitely picture themselves eventually warming up to a plan that would deploy thousands of servicemen and servicewomen overseas and earmark billions of dollars for a mission with no defined timetable.According to a nationwide poll three quarters of Americans acknowledged they could be coaxed into another war provided proponents avoided the word “war” altogether and instead referred to it as a “combat operation” or a “preemptive strike” while 81 percent said they wouldn’t put up too much of a fuss at all if Pentagon officials stated that the targeted regime might be harboring terrorists extremists evildoers enemies of freedom or similarly described groups of individuals.Additionally a full 92 percent of Americans claimed that they would by no means be opposed to signing on for a full-scale invasion in the event that such an action were repeatedly cast as a response to events that could be categorized as “atrocities.” These individuals added that officials wouldn’t even have to twist their arms too much so long as their claims were supported by pictures or footage of refugees fleeing their homes with only what possessions they could carry particularly if they had several frightened young children in tow.“Look I’m not just going to buy into something like this because I hear a couple TV personalities droning on about it—I need to see a four-star general appear on Meet The Press and declare that we must act decisively and then I need to see that clip of him saying those words played again and again on different news shows” Phoenix resident Christopher Thornton said noting that he could definitely get behind the plan if proponents offered some sort of grainy photo that looked conceivably like a stronghold or a chemical weapons storage site. “Then I’d need to see some trusted high-ranking official make some sort of point about America’s longstanding leadership role in geopolitical affairs. And supposing he made sure to praise the troops for their selfless sacrifice every step of the way he’d have me in his corner sooner or later.”“Honestly by the time he said that ‘We didn’t choose this war; this war chose us’ I’d pretty much be good to go” Thornton added.Members of the U.S. populace also told reporters that another war would be right up their alley if the national news media used words and phrases similar to the ones spoken by politicians and military leaders. Moreover the American populace said they’d most likely be fine with using ground troops if after listening to a very short and general description of the operation they then heard leaders loosely transition to an impassioned commentary about patriotism in which they mentioned that the freedoms we all enjoy have been the result of sacrifice.“Look if they want me in on this thing it would really help everything along if a few op-eds or radio hosts painted the enemy as nothing but a murderous tyrant who must be removed without once touching on the feasibility of establishing a new government once that adversary is gone” said Dale Rodgers of Toledo OH. “Then by the time I watched a panel of cable pundits agree on the importance of supporting our leaders in times of conflict I’d be primed for Congress to pass a joint resolution authorizing an open-ended military campaign especially if it was called ‘Operation Eternal Justice’ or something like that. Yeah that would do the trick.”“You know I’m actually getting more and more into the idea just talking about it right now” he added.

When I take an honest look at what I have to deal with day in and day out I just get depressed.”“Now every morning when I wake up I think ‘Ugh this again?’” he continued. “It’s not just disappointing; it’s humiliating really.”Noting that his body leaves him feeling inferior emasculated and exhausted at the end of each day Cooper said he could not even remember what it was he liked about it in the first place. Far from improving Cooper explained that his body has gone steadily downhill and grown more dysfunctional with time and admitted that as the years pass his likelihood of finding any redeeming aspects of his anatomy becomes more remote.Additionally given his age Cooper stated that he will probably have to remain in his current physical situation for the foreseeable future.“At this point I think it’s too late to do anything about it so the only thing I can really do is just accept it for what it is and go on with my life” said Cooper recognizing that while the world is full of people in circumstances far worse than his own such knowledge was hardly any consolation. “The thing is I remember seeing my father in this exact same situation when I was a kid and swearing that I would never let that happen to me. But of course I ended up just like him and I’m every bit as miserable as he was.”“I guess the best I can do now is try not to screw it up any more than I already have” Cooper added. “The last thing I’d want is for it to get any more unbearable.”

The moon has been integral not just to our nation’s space program but also to Earth itself regulating tides and stabilizing the planet’s rotational axis for billions of years.”“NASA deserves better than my indefensible remarks” added Bolden. “And most of all so does the moon.”In the email sent to several top NASA officials an exasperated Bolden appears to vent his frustrations about the agency’s historic involvement with the moon going so far as to say that Earth’s lone natural satellite “all but ruins the night sky for me” and that every dollar spent on lunar exploration might as well have been “thrown straight in the trash.” Later in the email Bolden seems to downplay the significance of the recent 45th anniversary of the historic Apollo 11 moon landing wondering “how the hell Neil Armstrong just didn’t fall asleep walking around on that thing.”Longtime colleagues of Bolden told reporters that while they respected him for his many contributions to the agency over the course of his career they agreed that his remarks concerning the widely beloved celestial body unmistakably sent from his email account and typed by his own hand had destroyed his credibility.“I wish I could understand what would possess someone so committed to space exploration to say such ugly things about the moon” NASA Associate Administrator Robert Lightfoot said adding that he was shocked and appalled when he read Bolden’s wish that the moon would “just wane itself out of existence.” “But his comments were clearly inexcusable. Unfortunately I think his resignation was the only way for NASA and for Charles himself to move forward.”“This isn’t the Charles Bolden I know” added Lightfoot. “At least the one I thought I knew.”Several unnamed NASA sources however told reporters that Bolden’s moon email was indicative of a pattern of intolerance that spanned decades and that also included derogatory comments about astronomical phenomena such as pulsars sunspots and the spherical mass of comet-like objects beyond the outermost planets known as the Oort cloud.Additionally sources pointed to an event honoring the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011 when a hot mic reportedly caught Bolden calling gas giant planets “big fucking nothings.”While an interim NASA administrator is expected to be appointed within days Bolden himself acknowledged that it would take time to find a successor capable of undoing the damage he had inflicted and even suggested that his attacks on the moon may in fact have irreparably tarnished the space agency’s legacy.“The person who will assume my post will be forced to shoulder an immense burden of my own making” Bolden said. “For the sake of America’s space program I only hope he or she will have the commitment and wherewithal to slowly build back the trust that I violated with my destructive words about Earth’s moon. It is a special important and unique astronomical body and NASA will always remain committed to it.”At press time NASA was launching a probe to deliver its formal apologies to the moon.

Even the youngest schoolchildren they acknowledged are routinely tasked with collecting their own sacks of human hair and nail clippings.According to the report parents are regularly called upon to donate old television sets so their children can deconstruct the emptiness of modern consumer culture while local businesses often provide the hundreds of gallons of used motor oil art students pour over their heads as part of a stark meditation on America’s obsession with violence.“Right now if we’re going to have enough raw poultry to complete our introductory unit on death it looks as though I’m going to have to go out to the supermarket and buy it myself” said Petaluma CA elementary school art instructor Mary Scofield adding that she has already petitioned her district for funds to cover the antique surgical instruments her students need to examine the futility of all human endeavor. “It’s ridiculous that I’m paying for it out of my own pocket but if I don’t my second-graders simply won’t have any chicken skin to scrawl Bible verses on and that’s just not fair to them.”In addition to cutbacks in the visual arts the report found that music theater and film programs have faced similar fiscal challenges. Teachers spoke of having to cancel performances in which students were to have taken turns striking a detuned piano with axes and of never receiving money that was earmarked for renting out a cavernous warehouse space in which a tape recorder suspended from the ceiling would have played the sound of a single laugh on an infinite loop.“How am I supposed to teach kids about the language of film without a video projector capable of alternately flashing the words ‘government’ and ‘lacerate’ on the side of an abandoned foundry?” said Eugene Hough 62 a high school teacher in Des Moines IA. “It’s disgraceful. My students want to subvert viewer expectations but they just don’t have the 8-millimeter black-and-white reel of a naked elderly woman crawling through the woods they would need to do it. We are quite frankly selling our children short.”“What happens when an entire generation of Americans graduates school without ever learning what art truly is?” he added.

Mitch McConnell (R-KY) exempts businesses from including prescription contraceptives morning-after pills and other forms of birth control in their employee health plans if such companies object to females on moral or ethical grounds. According to its backers the federal statute permits these employers to act in accordance with their aversion to women thereby safeguarding their most fundamentally held principles.“An employer’s choice to oppose women is among its most basic constitutional rights and one that the government must uphold” McConnell told Capitol Hill reporters emphasizing that Congress has no authority to impinge upon the core beliefs of businesses that choose not to cover contraceptive drugs and devices for a gender they do not recognize as legitimate. “Thanks to this landmark piece of legislation companies will never be required to conduct business in a manner that is in any way inconsistent with their longstanding moral convictions against all women.”“This nation was founded on the freedom to express one’s beliefs in all aspects of life ” he continued. “Therefore the government cannot compel private employers to do anything that undermines their firm and time-honored stance against that particular half of the population.”The Corporate Conscience Act’s legislative advocates reportedly drew the support of thousands of industry representatives across the country who in the past have decried what they considered overreaching federal regulations restricting their ability to make decisions informed by their steadfast opposition to all individuals who are not male.Companies ranging in size from multinational corporations to small family-owned retailers have asserted their right to operate according to their deeply ingrained views against the world’s mothers daughters sisters and wives. Many of these individuals told reporters that without the protections afforded by the newly enacted law a contraceptive mandate would effectively require them to abandon their corporate culture which they claim is firmly rooted in their traditional anti-woman principles.“This is a family company and rejecting women has been part of the way we do business since my grandfather opened his first location in 1948” said Eugene OR resident and Willamette Distributing owner Anthony Hahn insisting that decades spent disregarding every other human being represents a core value system that is the bedrock of his enterprise. “Our opposition to women has informed countless decisions we’ve made over the years and shaped this company into what it is today. It impacts how we work with our customers and how we treat our employees. And no Washington bureaucrat should be able to get in the way.”“It’s up to us to make sure the government respects everyone’s rights” he added.
2014-09-11T10:26:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/casino-reporting-steady-profits-from-slot-machine-that-1819576916,Casino Reporting Steady Profits From Slot Machine That Promises Players They Will Lose,LAS VEGAS—Touting robust traffic on par with some of its most popular games representatives from Las Vegas’ Bellagio resort said Thursday that the casino was enjoying steady profits from a new slot machine that explicitly guarantees players they will lose.The Lose Your Dollar machines 48 of which were reportedly installed on the casino’s main gaming floor several weeks ago feature a large prominent placard bolted to the front panel that unambiguously notifies players in six different languages that they have absolutely no chance of receiving any kind of payout.“We’re incredibly pleased there’s been such demand for a slot that makes winning utterly impossible” said casino representative Kelly Ambrose emphasizing that while some slot machines have traditionally offered longer odds than others Lose Your Dollar is the first to remove success from gameplay entirely. “From what we’ve seen people are genuinely excited about inserting a dollar bill losing and then inserting another dollar bill.”“And we’re more than happy to have them as our guests at the Bellagio” added Ambrose.According to casino sources each of the new machines features a simple design consisting of a plain gray outer casing with a side-mounted handle that when pulled immediately informs the player that he or she has lost the game by flashing the word “LOSER” on a screen and sounding a loud buzzer. Noticeably absent from the Lose Your Dollar slot are revolving reels of colorful icons or a payout tray which Bellagio officials confirmed was due to the fact no winning scenarios exist and no money will ever be disbursed. Once they lose players are quickly prompted to insert more cash through a lighted slot for bills which reportedly accepts denominations as high as $100.Bellagio representatives confirmed that all of the Lose Your Dollar slots are almost always in use typically with several people standing nearby waiting to play even during slower weekday and early morning periods. The new games also reportedly appeal to a wide demographic with men and women and young and old players alike feeding their money into the machines and walking away empty-handed 100 percent of the time.“Sometimes a slot takes a while to heat up so I just have to be patient” said Leonard Grant 54 a Bellagio guest who told reporters he was undeterred despite having lost approximately $750 in four hours at a Lose Your Dollar machine. “If I quit now I might be walking away from a jackpot that the next guy’s gonna get.”“It only takes one lucky break” added Grant inserting another dollar bill into the game and pulling the handle. “Damn! Think I’m getting close though. I can feel it.”If the new slot machines continue to perform well the Bellagio will reportedly move ahead with similar gaming innovations including a roulette wheel without a ball and a totally blank craps table where players can simply dump their chips and leave.
2014-09-05T11:55:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/chase-executives-fondly-recall-financial-company-s-hip-1819576898,Chase Executives Fondly Recall Financial Company’s Hip-Hop Roots,NEW YORK—Sitting in the multinational corporation’s boardroom Chase executives reportedly spent most of Friday afternoon nostalgically recalling the financial company’s hip-hop roots reminiscing about being young bankers who helped create the vibrant music cultural and investment scene in the South Bronx.“Chase came from the streets and we were part of this real underground banking movement that was thriving in hip-hop culture” said Chase Consumer and Community Banking chairman Todd “Bizzy B” Maclin of the FDIC-insured institution’s early days in the late 1970s before it became a household name. “Back in the day our financial crew was down with Afrika Bambaataa Morten Arntzen the Cold Crush Brothers Winthrop W. Aldrich—all the hip-hop pioneers.”“We were pushing the boundaries of providing lending services and experimenting with a lot of funky-ass fund transfers” Maclin added. “Everybody in the Bronx knew that Chase had the freshest deposits the freshest withdrawals and the freshest adjustable-rate mortgages.”Maclin who explained that the five pillars of hip-hop include DJing rapping graffiti art breakdancing and banking spoke reverently about Chase’s origins at “old-school block parties.” While describing the lively culture that thrived from 1977 to 1983 before hip-hop banking had gone mainstream Maclin told reporters that a diverse crowd of b-boys fledgling financiers and local residents attended the huge blowouts to listen to music dance and refinance debt at lower APRs.Speaking wistfully about one particular “wild bash” in 1978 Maclin smiled as he recalled how a packed dance floor erupted into a frenzy when a 19-year-old Chase teller “grabbed the mic” and started holding forth on loan modification provisions while DJ Jazzy Jay spun stripped-down electro-funk breaks.“Everyone was out there doing their thing whether it was boogieing performing transactions investing their money or opening checking accounts” said Maclin recalling the hours sitting on stoops with friends and developing dope ways to increase dividends. “I still remember giving out my first loan at a house party to Grandmaster Flash.”“You can still see early hip-hop’s influence on some of Chase’s more recent CDs” Maclin added.Maclin reportedly expressed a feeling of longing for an earlier time when hip-hop was in its infancy Chase was just starting out and financial executives were “banking from the heart.” Maclin admitted that Chase had lost touch with its hip-hop roots over the years claiming that the bank with more than 5100 branches and 16100 ATMs in the U.S. became “totally corporate” and sold out.Chase president Jamie Dimon told reporters that the formative years of hip-hop were a period when the bank was “really tearing shit up.” According to Dimon Chase was heavily influenced by ancient tribal money lending and often sampled the policies of innovative German banks from Dusseldorf.“That whole period was a renaissance and I still have vivid memories of coming home late from bank parties where we’d have Kool Herc spinning in the lobby” Dimon said. “Then I’d spend all night digging through this massive collection of financial records and doing some revolutionary underwriting.”“There was a lot of energy in the community and everybody was there like Bank of America First Federal Grand Wizzard Theodore Crash Crew Bank One Corp. and the Fly Five” added Dimon. “PNC and Washington Mutual were always hanging around too before they ended up going off to the West Coast.”While Dimon confirmed that Chase played an integral role in hip-hop’s “anything goes party atmosphere” the executive said that banking was the only way out of “the hood” for many young financial professionals.“It was a tough place and the cops wouldn’t even go there but banking provided hope for a lot of our clerks and loan officers who came from violent street gangs” Dimon said. “Nobody thought a financial institution could come from the ghetto. And banking in Manhattan didn’t even happen until they found out we were making money doing it in the Bronx.”Afrika Bambaataa who is widely regarded as the grandfather of hip-hop culture was sentimental while discussing Chase’s role in the evolution of hip-hop admiring how the bank developed talent and created unconventional amortized loans and groundbreaking transaction fees that forever transformed the financial and artistic movement.“Chase would always come straight with it” Bambaataa said. “Didn’t matter if they were issuing traditional IRAs or a home equity line of credit.”“A lot of hip-hop trailblazers came out of the Chase crew” added Bambaataa. “Duke Bootee Willard C. Butcher Melle Mel—all started out at Chase. They always had the best graffiti artists designing their deposit slips. And I’ll never forget watching Morten Arntzen rapidly cutting back and forth between two present value ordinary annuity tables.”Reached for further comment Chase executives admitted they were still embarrassed by the financial institution’s ill-conceived 1986 collaboration with Aerosmith.
2014-09-03T11:05:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/death-row-guard-has-always-had-soft-spot-for-the-innoce-1819576887,Death Row Guard Has Always Had Soft Spot For The Innocent Ones,ANGOLA LA—Saying he’s seen “a lot of people come through here in [his] day” and met prisoners of every type longtime Louisiana State Penitentiary death row guard Dwayne McFadden confided Wednesday that he’s always had a bit of a soft spot for the innocent ones.While the 57-year-old corrections officer said he strives to remain detached and professional when dealing with inmates awaiting execution he told reporters that invariably the men convicted of capital crimes they didn’t commit somehow always manage to find a way into his heart remaining there even after they are put to death.“When you’ve been here as long as I have you start to develop a special relationship with the guys who aren’t actually guilty” said McFadden noting that there have been so many such inmates during his 30 years on the job he has lost exact count. “You get to know them know their stories. And as they keep exhausting appeal after appeal you can’t help but take a liking to them.”“Even though it’s against prison rules I’ll sometimes let the innocent guys have an extra 10 minutes in the yard or maybe a couple extra library books” he added. “Little gestures here and there. It’s the least I can do for them.”McFadden acknowledged he has felt a personal and enduring emotional connection to virtually every one of the not-guilty death row inmates he has known from those assigned shoddy public defenders who failed to secure a plea deal to those sentenced on the basis of clearly fabricated police evidence and later-recanted testimony to those who were mentally unfit to stand trial in the first place.Often he said the prisoners who have stirred something inside him have been the ones who had the misfortune to be in the wrong place at the wrong time or were forced to sign confessions after being kept awake for dozens of hours of harsh coercive questioning. Additionally McFadden added that many of his favorite inmates over the years were simply victims of a bygone era before the use of DNA tests became standard.“Most of them are just these real nice guys from poor tough neighborhoods though I’ve seen falsely convicted men from all walks of life behind these walls” McFadden said of the maximum-security facility’s death row population. “Interesting thing is no matter where they come from or what their background the innocent ones all have this same look in their eyes that really melts your heart.”“It gets me every time” he continued. “They really are some of the sweetest people you’ll ever meet.”The guard explained that while all of the individuals under his watch are damaged on some level and the worst are merciless killers for whom there is no place in society the ones who are not actually murderers tend to be much more likable. According to McFadden when these inmates loudly protest their imprisonment or lash out physically in defiance of the system that has wronged them he always feels a twinge of sadness whenever he has to pepper-spray them into submission and then forcibly pin them against the floor until they are shackled.“You can’t help but feel for these guys as people when you’re keeping them under 24-hour suicide watch in the days leading up to their execution” he said adding that a nod and a little wave goes a long way when an innocent man is being led to his death. “I have to say I get kind of attached to them and I miss them when they’re gone.”“But most of the time that feeling doesn’t last too long” he added. “There are always more coming in.”

But I’ve got another five years at least.”“I know that someday we’ll be together for all eternity” Davison added. “It’s not going to be 15 minutes after he passes on though. I think that’s a bit hasty.”Davison said that while she is deeply saddened by the thought of life without her closest companion she acknowledged that she was actually pretty capable of imagining how things would be without him especially in two or three years when she has adjusted to her new routine. In addition to visiting friends more often and reading Davison said she would definitely spend more time watching her grandkids grow up enjoyable activities she is reluctant to sacrifice just so she can breathe her last breath at the very same moment her husband does.In fact Davis confirmed that if she still feels as healthy as she does right now she plans to make her first-ever visit to Redwood National Park once Roger dies a trip she would be unable to take if she were lying in bed looking over at her husband’s now-empty rocking chair and waiting to join him.“I’ll stay by his side until his very last second as a testament to our love but after that I’m moving on with things” Davison told reporters adding that dying together holding hands had genuinely never even occurred to her. “When he says ‘See you soon’ I’ll smile and nod but honestly it won’t be that soon. I feel great. As much as I love Roger now’s not the time.”“I sometimes ask myself if it’s even worth going on without him” Davison said. “And the answer’s always yes I think it is at least for a little while—probably longer.”
2014-08-25T12:46:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/fbi-raids-kennedy-fundamentalist-compound-1819576851,FBI Raids Kennedy Fundamentalist Compound,HYANNIS PORT MA—In a surprise predawn raid Monday heavily armed FBI agents stormed the notorious Kennedy Compound in Massachusetts reportedly arresting more than two dozen key members of the faction and exposing many of the bizarre inner workings of this insular fundamentalist organization.According to officials agents in full SWAT gear disembarked from patrol boats just off Cape Cod and quickly advanced upon the 6-acre oceanfront compound. The raid followed a multiyear investigation into illicit activities by the secretive Kennedy group which are said to have included substance abuse rampant promiscuity and carefully formulated plans to seize control of the United States.“At approximately 4:15 a.m. federal agents entered the Kennedy premises apprehending numerous individuals and charging them with multiple counts of attempting to infiltrate the government at federal state and local levels” said lead investigator Frank Campbell adding that the group’s steadily expanding network of members has used the compound as a base from which to extend its power for decades. “Our investigation indicates that several charismatic leaders within the sect manufactured an intense cult of personality that over the years they have used to hold sway over many thousands of followers nationwide.”“It appears that the people at the top of this structure possessed a near-pathological desire to exert control over others and manipulate their beliefs” he continued. “These are ideologues plain and simple. To the many people who got caught up in this so-called family these individuals’ power of persuasion was irresistible.”Searching the three clapboard houses that compose the compound investigators said they found numerous symbols consistent with intense fanaticism including framed photographs of their late leader John F. Kennedy upon whom family members appear to have accorded a sort of godlike status. Sources confirmed that the messianic figure spoke of a mystical “New Frontier” and believed the future of his people hinged upon making a journey to the moon a mission he ordered his followers to carry out as quickly as possible.Records show the compound was established in 1926 by Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. a man referred to as “the patriarch” and believed to have more than 100 descendants. A survey of land deeds determined that Kennedy’s children and grandchildren—many of whom were known to take multiple wives and produce unusually large numbers of offspring to propagate their ranks—later bought up several of the surrounding Hyannis Port properties apparently to keep family members confined in close proximity while keeping outsiders at bay.Providing evidence of the group’s eccentric ideology FBI forensic psychologist Ada Willmann told reporters the Kennedy clan’s belief system is structured around the central concept of “Camelot” within which the family perceives itself in grand mythic terms as a kind of modern-day American royalty.“Given such profound levels of self-delusion we’re clearly dealing with a group of people who have divorced themselves from reality” said Willmann adding that interrogators have been able to glean little new information from the family members now in custody who so far have stuck to similar lines of strange utopian rhetoric. “Remember many members of the Kennedy group have been trapped in the compound for decades. They appear to have been subject to the same rigid philosophy and forced to repeat the same mantras again and again. Over the years they have become increasingly closed-off and paranoid and the hardliners who remain are fully indoctrinated.”“They all look the same talk the same and even dress the same” she added. “It’s very unsettling.”FBI officials acknowledged the success of the Kennedy raid stands in stark contrast to a botched operation two years ago at the remote Cheney family ranch in the Wyoming wilderness where 14 federal agents attempting to serve a warrant were gunned down by extremists on site.

So when one of our prisoners wants to use the restroom or has to report for laundry duty for example he’ll now walk past areas controlled by the Aryan Brotherhood Raza Unida the Vice Lords and so forth—all groups he never would have had the opportunity to connect with normally.”“Both our guards and our prisoners are very excited about the new setup” he added. “I think it’s going to make for a much more modern dynamic incarceration experience.”DeNault explained to reporters that in place of hundreds of individual cells Menard now features a sprawling 700000-square-foot open area lined with multiple rows of ergonomic beds separated by short panels of frosted glass. The renovations have also reportedly included a refurbishing of the prison’s general aesthetic with the facility’s electronically sealed doors and iron bars having been removed in favor of exposed brick and large wall-mounted LCD TV screens that display the Illinois Department of Corrections seal.Additionally sources confirmed that the facility has exchanged its steel benches for brightly colored teal and orange couches on which prisoners can lounge while engaged in their work program jobs of sewing bedspreads or mixing roadway paint for 30 cents an hour.“I’d gotten used to spending 22 hours a day in my cell with the door locked but I have to admit that this new layout has been kind of nice” said convicted drug trafficker Miguel Flores 38 noting that prior to the floor plan update he tended to only associate with felons housed in his immediate cell block. “Just yesterday I struck up a conversation with this sex offender after passing him a few times on the way to the yard and before I knew it we were exchanging OxyContin hookups. That never would have happened in the old setup.”“And if I do need some space to myself I can always hit one of the guards in the face with a cafeteria tray and get thrown into solitary for a couple days” Flores added. “Though there are only a few cells back there and they tend to fill up pretty fast.”In addition to the improved energy and sense of community the new open-plan system is said to have instilled many inmates claimed that the updated layout has allowed them to work more closely with their fellow career criminals. Specifically a number of prisoners told reporters that the new floor plan facilitates open channels of dialogue that allow gang leaders to more effectively communicate with subordinates and coordinate their attacks on rivals.“The guys in my corridor were a little hesitant about the open-plan concept at first but it’s already paying off” said 45-year-old Adam “Bleach” Chamberlain who is currently serving a life sentence without parole for the 2006 murder of his ex-girlfriend in Chicago. “Just the other day I overheard a few guys talking about shanking someone who ratted out their liquor and cell phone smuggling operation. Because they were discussing it in the open nearby I was able to step right into the conversation and say ‘Hey why not jump him when he goes to the infirmary and just bash his skull against the sink and kick his teeth out?’ Something like that just wouldn’t be possible if we were still locked up in separate cells.”“We really beat the fuck out of him” he continued.Menard’s directors have also been pleased with the new floor plan noting that the updated layout is far more cost-effective than the previous arrangement as it allows the prison to add considerably more hardened criminals without necessitating a substantial investment in steel-reinforced barriers corridors with controlled-access gates and rimless toilets for each inmate.While warden Kim Butler said she has been satisfied with the inmates’ response overall she admitted that it will take a certain amount of time to fully adjust to the new surroundings for some convicts particularly the mentally unstable and those at the bottom of the prison’s social pecking order who now feel more exposed.“Sure it sometimes gets a little loud and once in a while the entire prison will erupt into an uncontrollable race riot but these are just minor drawbacks” Butler said. “Once our inmates consider the numerous advantages of spending the next few years or the remainder of their lives in an open-plan layout I’m confident they’ll come around to the new setup.”“And if they don’t it’s not exactly like they have a choice” Butler added.
2014-08-19T11:25:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/chinese-journalists-bemoan-decline-of-traditional-state-1819576836,Chinese Journalists Bemoan Decline Of Traditional State-Run Newspapers, Rise Of State-Run New Media,BEIJING—Claiming the changed media landscape of the digital age has led to a marked drop in the depth and quality of party propaganda veteran reporters in China expressed concern this week over what they see as the decline of traditional state-controlled journalism in their country.As critics reflected on the proliferation of government-operated clickbait news sites the emphasis on social-media-friendly propagandist content designed solely to boost traffic and the pressure to disseminate the latest manipulative falsehoods with ever-greater speed many questioned whether the state-run media was still living up to its responsibility to serve as the trusted mouthpiece of the Communist Party of China.“Reporters used to have the time to sit down read the day’s official press release from the Central Propaganda Department and craft a carefully written 2000-word article describing the government’s flawless response to a massive earthquake or deadly riot” said Zhang Li of the People’s Daily describing the great care she and her colleagues take in upholding censorship standards. “Now we’re given 15 minutes to whittle down a party directive on the booming economy into a single paragraph that they’ll post on our social media page in the hopes it goes viral.”“These days being a journalist is more about getting pageviews than it is about actually scrubbing out all the information deemed too sensitive for the masses” she added.Veteran reporters said they rarely see the type of lengthy in-depth cover-ups that were once the mainstay of state-controlled media back when the collapse of a coal mine would send journalists marching directly to the source to ask pre-approved questions at staged press conferences and to tour the few areas of the site the government had cleared for them to photograph.Under today’s model journalists explained government newspapers are far more likely to settle for tweeting out the party’s official response and then asking readers to sound off in their website’s heavily censored and sometimes entirely fabricated comment section.According to sources most editors believe the audience for long-form propaganda no longer exists and so reporters spend their days producing slideshows that promote the government’s myth of complete religious freedom or hastily writing top 10 lists that distort perceptions of Europe and the United States.“I understand that we can no longer expect to tightly control the thoughts of our citizens with a newspaper they dutifully read every morning” said Guangming Daily’s Wu Qiang who admitted he is tired of lacing every feature he writes on Mao Tse-tung’s legacy of peace and prosperity with modern pop cultural references in an effort to appeal to millennials. “But we’ve swung to such an extreme emphasis on speed interactivity and mass appeal that we’re content to post a breaking headline about the Tibetan people’s deep appreciation for our benevolent governance and simply update it every 15 minutes as more misinformation becomes available.”“This certainly isn’t the type of journalism we learned when we were studying for our loyalty exams” he continued.Beyond their concerns with the quality of today’s government messaging a number of veteran journalists have spoken of their fear of losing jobs to a younger generation more adept at promoting the Politburo’s objectives through social media.“We used to have an entire division of seasoned reporters who when rampant protests were taking place in Xinjiang could write up dozens of puff pieces to fill out a morning issue that made no mention of the incident” said Ma Jianzhu of the Liberation Daily. “But now they’ve been almost completely replaced by a bunch of web analytics people whose job it is to make sure whatever we end up writing to downplay Uyghur unrest or the toxic levels of plastic in the water supply has enough of the right keywords to get us on the front page of Google.”“It’s pretty shameless stuff if you ask me” he added.
2014-08-18T14:54:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/geneticists-debate-ethics-of-cloning-humans-and-forcing-1819576833,Geneticists Debate Ethics Of Cloning Humans And Forcing Them To Fight To Death In Pit For Our Amusement,GENEVA—In an effort to explore the complex moral issues surrounding the controversial topic the world’s leading geneticists gathered at an international conference this week to debate the ethics of cloning human beings and compelling them to fight to the death in a rocky pit for our amusement.According to organizers the five-day symposium provided luminaries in the field of bioengineering an opportunity to thoughtfully deliberate on the moral dilemma of creating hundreds of genetically identical copies of an individual human arming them with bladed weapons and forcing them to violently slaughter each other solely as a captivating pastime for spectators.“Cloning human beings and using various intimidation tactics to coerce the genetic duplicates to battle inside a craggy dimly lit arena certainly raises numerous ethical questions but the benefits of cheap incredibly exciting blood-drenched brawls outweigh potential violations of moral principles” biologist Richard K. Phillips said during a panel discussion arguing that dozens of identical combatants fighting until only one is left standing would provide countless hours of gripping entertainment. “While such practices would assuredly be detrimental to the clones that are ruthlessly beaten to death in the fighting pit we cannot underestimate the net benefit to humankind at large of watching five unarmed versions of a single man gang up on another indistinguishable genetic copy who say had this huge club covered in spikes.”“Or imagine 10 clones of one person in a bout against 10 clones of a different person” Phillips continued. “I wholeheartedly believe that it is the responsibility of science to advance human society by creating something so fucking cool.”Throughout the conference the geneticists reportedly participated in numerous roundtable discussions to examine the contentious subject matter debating whether human individuality would be diminished if for example someone dictated which weapons the cloned humans must use while fighting to the death. In addition scientists contemplated if it was socially misguided to line the battle pits with razor wire and glass shards or if it was intrinsically immoral to charge audiences a fee to watch physically identical combatants participate in the brutal matches.Despite considerable support from the scientific community critics argued that it was reprehensible and unethical to use clones genetically selected for specific cognitive traits and physical attributes that would lead to greater carnage such as people who produced higher than normal levels of adrenaline or psychopathic individuals with diminished capacities for empathy.“Not only is it unethical to choose subjects to clone based on their predilection for ruthless and bloodthirsty behavior but it is undeniably irresponsible to make hundreds of copies of these disturbed individuals” said geneticist Kenneth Wilson in a keynote speech warning that cataclysmic consequences would occur if the dangerous clones escaped from the pit. “Do we really want to put our world at risk just for more appealing aggressive and barbaric free-for-alls?”“My colleagues in the field seem to have forgotten that human life is precious” added Wilson. “That’s why it would have a far greater impact to force regular non-cloned individuals to butcher one another for our amusement.”The geneticists reportedly debated a number of related moral questions as well including the ethical implications of leading individuals blindly into the arena and not informing them that they would be fighting their exact clone until their hood is removed and they see that they’re dueling themselves. The scientists reportedly also explored the virtues of coercing cloned humans to fight younger versions of themselves from 20 years earlier and formally discussed whether it was right or wrong to secretly transport human clones to a completely different place like a remote island in the South Pacific where they would hunt one another with rifles.Proponents of the practice however stressed that a great deal of scientific knowledge could be acquired by cloning humans and forcing them to fight to the death such as learning precisely how a human would look its own clone in the eye while killing it understanding the potential of the human mind for perpetrating gruesome violence against what is essentially itself and determining whether spectators would eventually raise objections to replacing the clones’ limbs with axes and swords.“We could learn a considerable amount about making new organs from this cloning process” said panelist Dr. Sandra Butler. “And in turn determine whether it’s possible to put those organs into wounded clones so that they can continue to battle. If successful that would be a revolutionary advancement for these savage melees.”Advocates for cloning humans and forcing them to mercilessly massacre each other were reportedly in unanimous agreement however that the vicious spectacles must be regulated to avoid potential abuses.

The exchange will reportedly be overseen by third-party mediator and soft pretzel vendor Auntie Anne’s which has helped broker previous accords between the optical chains including a famous 1998 treaty that required the warring companies to suspend any buy-one-get-one deals on select pairs of no-line bifocals as well as last year’s non-proliferation agreement that compelled both parties to reduce their massive stockpiles of sunlight-activated Transitions lenses.According to sources the prisoner transfer was delayed due to a number of sticking points including Pearle Vision’s refusal to come to the table until its rival agreed to remove all Ralph Lauren and DKNY frames from its clearance display racks as a prerequisite to any good faith discussions.Negotiations were reportedly also nearly scuttled due to LensCrafters’ refusal to turn over Cincinnati Pearle Vision on-site optician David Kowalski who was captured by rival forces earlier this year after allegedly attempting to reconnoiter a nearby LensCrafters mini-mall storefront during his lunch break.“While we are focused on welcoming home our brave eye care specialists we must also remember that our rival’s history of abuse toward its prisoners leaves open the possibility that our staff members may have been tortured while in captivity” said Pearle Vision general manager Pete Bridgman referring to persistent allegations that detainees held in LensCrafters locations have been shackled in eye examination chairs for hours at a time and fitted with high tint density Ray-Ban sunglasses that leave them shrouded in virtual darkness. “Should we learn of such cruel treatment it will leave us no option other than swift and devastating retaliation by offering free scratch-resistant lens coating which will viciously undercut our competition and draw in considerable foot traffic.”As confirmed by experts on the conflict’s history the prisoner exchange represents a rare moment of détente in a long-running dispute between the two eyeglass retailers that has at numerous points in years past veered dangerously close to the full-scale mutual launch of “lowest price guarantee” promotions.However with both sides reportedly continuing to amass increasing quantities of affordable polycarbonate trivex and photochromic lenses experts warned that the de-escalation of tensions achieved by the prisoner swap may only be temporary.“Releasing a few detainees is a noteworthy accomplishment but it’s only a small step in a struggle that has already left a swath of destruction across shopping centers and outdoor malls throughout the United States” said independent observer and Lids executive Lloyd Hayward. “Regardless of whether this transfer goes through both sides have been threatening to institute sweeping back-to-school savings on all TAG Heuer rimless and semi-rimless glasses that if enacted will result in prices being slashed on a level unlike anything we’ve seen since this war’s outbreak.”“And if that happens all hell will break loose” he added.

Additionally the Staminator reportedly plunges riders into winding pitch-black underground tunnels for two straight days returning to the surface for a 10-hour ascent to the peak of Mount Elbert in Colorado before forcing passengers to endure a precipitous 1400-story drop.According to a warning sign posted for the ride passengers are recommended to empty their pockets before the ride begins and securely strap nonperishable foods and important medications to their body. The sign also reportedly advises riders to prepare for a wide variety of weather during the ride with temperatures ranging from 120 degrees in Death Valley to 20 degrees below zero during a 400-mile stretch in the Rocky Mountains that is above the tree line.“I’m a bit of an adrenaline junkie so when I heard about a ride where you stay upside down across all of the Pacific Northwest I had to check it out” said passenger Ronnie Grubert whose face was dirty and heavily bearded after taking the inaugural ride on the Staminator. “I loved all of it although I must have passed out from either altitude sickness or dehydration when we did an inclined dive loop from Phoenix to Houston.”“It was pretty crazy” Grubert added. “I think I lost my right flip-flop over one of the Great Plains states.”Busch Gardens officials told reporters that after exiting the endurance coaster upon its return to the park passengers would have the opportunity to remember their experience by purchasing a photo of themselves taken just as the coaster crested the Continental Divide on day nine of the ride.“I have to admit that I closed my eyes for the first few states and I didn’t really like getting wet when we dipped underwater for the entire length of Lake Tahoe but overall I thought it was incredible” said passenger Andrew Hoppe. “Honestly the whole thing went by really fast so I’d love to go again. It sucks that you have to wait in line for 90 minutes to get back on though.”“This time I’ll definitely be going to the bathroom beforehand” Hoppe added.Busch Gardens officials also unveiled the Staminator Junior a modest-paced children’s ride on a quarter-mile track that goes in circles 15000 times.
2014-08-07T13:01:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/survey-americans-watching-better-sex-than-ever-1819576788,Survey: Americans Watching Better Sex Than Ever,LOS ANGELES—Reflecting a significant shift in societal attitudes and behaviors a survey completed this week by researchers at the University of Southern California revealed that American adults are watching far better sex than ever before.The initial findings which sociologists gathered from thousands of telephone and in-person interviews as well as field observations confirmed that the sex that U.S. citizens now see on screen is considerably more adventurous passionate and satisfying than any they have previously experienced.“Based on our data the American people are now regularly viewing the highest quality sex of their lives which is characterized by stronger connections with those on screen and longer more fulfilling climaxes” said lead researcher Patricia Oberlin adding that the vast majority of those surveyed claimed they have watched “mind-blowing” or “earth-shattering” sex within the past five days. “Every demographic that we queried—individuals and couples young and old males and females gay and straight—they’re all engaging in rich and rewarding sex-watching lives with many respondents reporting that they never imagined they would ever see such thrilling sex.”“We found that Americans now routinely take part in watching wild energetic sexual intercourse which often lasts for greater lengths of time” Oberlin continued. “And the frequency of sex viewing in the U.S. has increased as well with many people saying they watch sex every day of the week and occasionally two times per night. All in all Americans’ sex-viewing lives are incredibly active.”Sociologists attributed the improved quality of copulation that Americans are watching to an increased level of attention paid to their particular desires during sex-viewing. This heightened level of comfort and empowerment while watching sex according to researchers has allowed the general public to shed their inhibitions and view a wider variety of erotic acts with many Americans reportedly experimenting with different or unfamiliar positions toys age groups and ethnic and racial backgrounds to keep their viewing lives fresh and interesting.“Earlier in their lives people might have only been exposed to an old-fashioned sexual viewing experience where the sex was fairly routine and the emphasis was entirely on pleasuring the male but our data shows that this isn’t always the case anymore” Oberlin said. “In fact we found that a large number of Americans even prefer to watch sex that focuses solely on female pleasure and doesn’t involve men at all.”Researchers confirmed that since the last time the survey was conducted in 1989 there has been a large increase in watching forms of sex that were previously considered taboo citing examples such as oral sex performed to the point of asphyxiation fisting and erotic lactation.While the study determined that vaginal intercourse is still by far the most commonly viewed sexual act in the U.S. more Americans including a large percentage of women indicated they are now open to watching fellatio cunnilingus anal penetration and dominance and submission.“I used to only watch the missionary position which was kind of boring but now I’ve been getting into watching sensual massages and role-playing stuff with cheerleader costumes” said Patrick Sanders 38 a Phoenix-area husband and father of two. “The truth is I used to have a lot of hang-ups and I couldn’t even fathom watching a threesome with two men and one woman. In fact the thought of seeing another guy’s penis during sex-viewing was just gross. But it turns out I was missing out on watching some really hot sex.”“At this point I’m completely fine seeing someone ejaculate on pretty much any body part—in fact that’s something I discovered I actually enjoy viewing” added Sanders. “I’m even thinking of exploring watching bondage. That’s something I never could have viewed years ago.”Researchers also found that Americans are spicing up their sex-watching lives by viewing intercourse in different settings such as bedrooms kitchens bathrooms offices classrooms parks college dorms public spaces and even moving vehicles.In addition many of those surveyed said they are watching sex more spontaneously or viewing it at unusual times of day which they said increased their arousal.“Sometimes I’ll watch sex first thing in the morning before I roll out of bed and get ready for work and it’s fantastic” said Mitch Watson adding that he has never felt more alive. “I thought I was watching pretty good sex in my 20s but this is a whole new level. I know what I want to watch now and it’s a little more unrestrained and kinky.”“Last week my wife and I booked a hotel for a couple nights and spent the entire time in the room” continued Watson. “We just ordered room service and watched great sex all weekend.”

It discusses how their lives have changed since being seated together what they remember most about their time aboard and what advice they would give to future Delta travelers.In “5 Delta Passenger-Athletes Dominating Sports” the magazine profiles former passengers who have gone on to successful athletic careers including up-and-coming high school tennis star Bryan Kerns three of the 20 members of the Alfred State College women’s volleyball team and two-time NBA champion and 26-time Delta flier LeBron James.Additionally the editors said each issue will include old pictures and stories of former passengers’ favorite Delta memories in the regular columns “Flights Of Fancy” and “Touching Down” and will also feature articles on the kinds of work currently being carried out by the pilots and flight attendants at their alma mater.“I was friendly with everyone in my boarding group but my seatmate and I are still really close—we see each other all the time” alumnus John Harley writes in a story titled “Delta Flight #5803: Where Are They Now?” “Obviously I met passengers from other parts of the cabin while waiting for the bathroom or picking up my luggage but the people who were seated near me are the ones I spent the most time with. The guys in row 31 seats A through C were actually in my wedding.”“It’s weird to think that when I first met my good friend Mark he was just on standby” he continues. “Now he’s a member of the Delta Sky Club—my how times have changed. But we still all meet back at LaGuardia every five years to catch up.”Harley goes on to write that he and his friends always return to the same Auntie Anne’s location between Gates B5 and B7 where they ate 20 years ago noting that “After all these years that place is still going strong.”According to Delta officials every issue of Flown will include a postage-paid mail-in form that alumni can use to make a tax-deductible donation to the airline.
2014-08-06T12:44:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/date-s-flaws-coming-at-woman-faster-than-she-can-ration-1819576782,Date’s Flaws Coming At Woman Faster Than She Can Rationalize Them,WILMINGTON DE—Over the course of their dinner Tuesday evening at a local bar and grill area woman Melissa Kowalski 27 reportedly faced a constant stream of her date’s personal flaws so swift and intense that she could not possibly rationalize them all.Kowalski told reporters that throughout her 90-minute first date with 28-year-old digital media producer Colin Layner she was unable to formulate the excuses and justifications necessary to keep pace with his rapidly emerging negative qualities admitting that at numerous points she became completely overwhelmed by the unrelenting barrage of deficiencies in Layner’s behavior background career general personality and physical appearance.“The second we stepped into the restaurant I had to tell myself that not holding the door open for me just meant that he wasn’t caught up in old-fashioned gender norms but from there his shortcomings just never let up” Kowalski said describing the deluge of her date’s social missteps character defects and lackluster table manners that she had to negotiate throughout the meal. “Each flaw—from his tendency to talk over me to his poorly groomed facial hair—required time to process and then explain away but they kept coming at me all night sometimes three or four of them at once.”“Honestly I started losing track of all of his faults before our drinks even arrived” Kowalski continued. “I was barely done convincing myself that his wheezing laugh is somewhat endearing when he got a little curt with our waiter and I had to chalk that up to him having a rough day at work. It was just about impossible to keep up.”Kowalski confirmed that she spent the vast majority of her time with Layner frantically attempting to come to terms with his numerous imperfections each one of which she explained would typically have required an entire evening for her to excuse under normal circumstances. However given the breakneck speed with which Layner’s flaws—from his evident dandruff to the fact that the majority of his anecdotes about himself revolved around drinking—were being unleashed Kowalski said she could only give each a cursory rationalization before being compelled to move on to the next.According to Kowalski Layner began their conversation by mentioning that he hadn’t been on a date “in ages” a statement she reportedly justified by speculating that his busy professional schedule prevented him from meeting many women. However when he then immediately explained that he recently started a new job after being out of work for more than a year—which Kowalski attributed to the sluggish economy—she was forced to revise her thinking and assume that Layner hadn’t dated much because he may have just ended a long-term relationship.“About halfway through dinner I realized that even though I had spent the entire evening trying to get a handle on his flaws I wasn’t even close to being caught up” Kowalski said pointing to Layner’s poor posture and how he barely asked any questions about her both of which she was unable to find time to address. “It seemed like whenever I managed to justify one flaw there were two more waiting for me to deal with. After a while it all became a blur.”“And when he casually mentioned that he was ‘not much of a reader’ I had to push that out of my mind without ever coming back to it” she continued. “At that point I was just falling too far behind.”Kowalski reported that the outpouring of flaws reached its greatest intensity at the meal’s conclusion with nearly every action and sentence from Layner revealing some new and unexpected red flag. After briefly retreating to the bathroom to collect herself and resolve a few stray flaws that she hadn’t yet whitewashed Kowalski reportedly decided to only attempt to make excuses for Layner’s smaller imperfections and made a mental note to remember his larger flaws until after the date when she would have ample time to try to justify them.“The end of dinner was the toughest stretch” Kowalski said. “He assumed we would be splitting the check—which I accepted by noting it is actually pretty common these days—before leaving the waiter a 10 percent tip so I had to give him the benefit of the doubt on that and trust that he simply miscalculated. And then as we were leaving he started typing on his phone while I was talking to him so I had to assume he had just gotten an important work email which seemed plausible until I remembered that a few minutes earlier I had gotten over the fact that he only works part-time by reminding myself that he probably doesn’t want to put his full effort into a job he doesn’t consider a long-term career. The whole thing got pretty exhausting.”“Colin does seem like a good guy though” Kowalski continued after a short pause. “I’d say yeah I think we might end up being a good match actually.”When reached for comment Layner confirmed that while he thought Kowalski was “very nice” he would likely not go out with her again as he found it difficult to look past the fact that she is several inches taller than him.
2014-08-05T10:07:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/seventh-grader-only-has-2-weeks-left-to-acquire-cool-id-1819576778,Seventh-Grader Only Has 2 Weeks Left To Acquire Cool Identity By First Day Of School,VALPARAISO IN—Expressing concern that his summer vacation is too quickly passing him by local incoming seventh-grader Matthew Valentine told reporters Tuesday he now has just two weeks left in which to acquire a cool new identity before school starts.The 13-year-old acknowledged that he must dedicate all his remaining free time to developing a socially acceptable persona he can display to his classmates noting that he still has a lot of work to do if he is to assemble a recognizable combination of attitudes style choices interests and favorite bands that will win his peers’ approval during the upcoming school year.“The clock is ticking and I still haven’t figured out who I’m going to be yet” said Valentine adding that he hopes to remake himself as a popular kid a scenester a rebel a hip-hop head or a member of some other respected social category prior to his first day of classes at Thomas Jefferson Middle School. “At one point I was going to try to come back as a skater punk but I never did learn to skateboard and after that I kind of lost track of the days. Now I’ve really got to scramble if I’m going to put together a cool personality.”“I mean school starts August 20th!” he continued. “I’ve only got a few days left to get down to work and change myself into the person I want people to think I am.”The middle-schooler confirmed he is currently considering which speech patterns mannerisms clothing preferences and hangout spots to adopt. He stressed that he must select between a variety of potential identities—from intellectual to class clown—carefully hone his presentation of his new personality and then convincingly sell that persona to his fellow TJMS students when school starts.To that end the teenager said he has begun testing slang phrases quietly under his breath throughout the day and has spent hours trying out different hairstyles and facial expressions—including aloof indifference casual self-assurance and unruly defiance—in his bathroom mirror. According to Valentine he attempted a “dry run” earlier this week in which he made a trip to his local mall while experimenting with the appearance and demeanor of a ska kid “just to see if it clicked.”Valentine also admitted to making a number of false starts during his three-month break from school pointing to an aborted attempt to play summer sports and present himself as a jock as well as four futile weeks spent trying to teach himself acoustic guitar in hopes of becoming a sensitive artistic type.“I have a few collared shirts so I guess I could start acting real preppy and see if that sticks” said Valentine who cited hopes of distancing himself from his sixth-grade friends and being taken in by another more socially prominent clique. “Or maybe I’ll just grow out my hair a little wear a hemp beanie and become a stoner. I honestly wouldn’t know where to buy any pot though and I’m not sure I’d want to anyway. This is really tough.”Describing a catastrophic and speedily abandoned attempt to “go goth” after winter break last year the seventh-grader said he had learned a valuable lesson about the consequences of not choosing a well-constructed identity before returning to school. According to Valentine the group of goth kids at his junior high which had coalesced early in the fall term dismissed him as a poseur and after a day or two he was forced to put away his black clothing and boots and return to being a normal kid.“There’s a very short window at the start of school when I have to establish myself and then I’m that person for the rest of the year” Valentine said. “One thing’s for sure: If I don’t get my act together start pretending to like a completely different type of music and choose to either love or hate team sports then I won’t have any option but to suck it up and go back to school as myself.”“God I really really hope it doesn’t come to that” he added.

Children are bound to replicate this behavior as adults though some actually start as early as high school.” Cantrell added that the best hope for breaking the cycle was for parents to quit raising their child as early as possible.

Can a book read its own pages? No. It’s now clear to us that despite all the painstakingly conducted studies and all the data we have meticulously gathered since the late 19th century we have in essence been nothing more than the snake that devours its own tail.”“All that we thought we understood was merely a mirage crafted by the very unfathomable minds we once so stubbornly insisted we could know” added Kaslow before declaring the APA with its 134000 members and 54 academic divisions forever disbanded.In the wake of the development sources confirmed that thousands of researchers at top academic institutions had resigned from their posts effective immediately and had been seen packing decades’ worth of academic journals—as well as seminal works such as Sigmund Freud’s The Interpretation Of Dreams Jean Piaget’s The Psychology Of Intelligence and Alfred Adler’s Understanding Human Nature—into boxes that will be placed in storage indefinitely or disposed of at nearby landfills.According to reports from one prominent university visitors to the psychology department found the chair’s office locked but with a note on the door that simply read “It was all an illusion.”Over the past few days researchers across the psychology spectrum have reportedly discontinued their experiments and returned their funding to its original sources stating that further investigations had been rendered irrelevant by the completely unreliable and fatally subjective nature of the human mind.“If only we could step outside these imperfect intellects for but one moment and observe our mental functions as they truly are” said clinical psychologist Deborah Yamada who explained that the discipline was inherently and fatally corrupted by the inescapable reality that the examiner and the examined are one and the same. “And yet when we honestly appraise the human condition what can the mind truly know that is not a mere waking dream?”“And even that dream can it genuinely be said to exist? For is not the moment I grasp the limits of my consciousness the very moment it becomes unknowable?” Yamada continued. “More to the point: What is this ‘I’ that supposedly speaks in the first place? And why do I—whatever that may be—so childishly cling to it?”Reached for comment many from the now-dissolved psychology community told reporters that they hoped to redirect their efforts toward other sciences such as physics chemistry and geology fields they hoped would be untainted by the “inescapable enigma” of consciousness.“If I can no longer study myself then so be it: I will pursue that which is concrete and measurable” said Harvard University experimental psychologist Steven Pinker holding up a quartz crystal before his eyes. “Look at it: Irrefutable. Solid. So unlike the elusive mind.”“Only this I can truly know” Pinker added. “That is if I can know anything at all.”

Do you really expect me to just stare at a bunch of empty space?”“I just want something to scroll through or click on or swipe” Camp added. “I can’t keep looking at nothing.”Men and women in all 50 states are reportedly insisting that the nation’s top engineers and tech companies begin immediately developing some kind of constantly updating content feed or colorful display that is capable of glowing vibrating or emitting a short jingle during those moments they turn their heads to one side or another a period in which they are currently deprived of access to any source of media stimulus whatsoever.When contacted by reporters Americans said they would be receptive to a backlit interface that displays blinking text presents a slideshow of photographs or makes a tinkling sound when touched. However these individuals emphasized that they didn’t particularly care what the specific nature of the new media display was or how it worked provided it was capable of fully occupying the agonizing four-tenths of a second in which both their phone and laptop screens remain beyond their line of sight.“I’m open to anything—as long as I can look at it and have it light up and maybe flash an icon at me” said sales associate Kevin Broadbridge of San Francisco noting that some level of interactivity or internet connectivity would be “good” but not strictly essential. “I really just want to be able to check the weather on my phone tap whatever this new thing is a few times and then go back to viewing a YouTube clip on my laptop without having to kill time looking at my pant leg or couch cushions or anything else that’s in between.”While most Americans said that a source of media to fill the empty area between their cell phones and laptops should be a top priority a recent nationwide survey also revealed a widespread desire to bridge other unbearable entertainment gaps in citizens’ lives. Specifically the poll found that 77 percent of respondents want an engaging animation to appear in their browser windows during the period it takes for a website to refresh with a further 86 percent seeking a graphic or other feature to replace the seemingly interminable black screen that momentarily appears when they switch between two different television channels.Additionally a full 95 percent of respondents insisted on the installation of an additional screen on the backs of their phones and tablets for those moments in which such devices are left resting face down.“A lot of the time I’ll have to plug in my laptop or Kindle so I can keep using it but the electrical outlet is just this white piece of plastic that doesn’t move or give me badges or anything; there should be some display there that I can look at instead” said Elizabeth Cantanzaro of El Paso TX. “And when I look at my remote control for my TV all the buttons just have a bunch of numbers on them. Who wants to see that? Those should all be screens too.”“But the screens shouldn’t take any time to load” she added. “I don’t want to have to wait. I don’t like that.”At press time Americans had upped their demands by calling for some type of media capable of providing them something to look at when they blink.

That’s kind of disturbing.”As a man who spends a considerable portion of his free time playing online poker and the majority of his disposable income on car stereo equipment Morgan admitted it made him uneasy to consider he might have a true soulmate somewhere who could connect with him on every level. In particular Morgan said he had trouble comprehending that any woman could enjoy conversing with someone who almost always steers the discussion back toward anecdotes about guys he knew in high school and often repeats the same handful of lines from the movie Billy Madison that he has been quoting for nearly 20 years.Morgan added that if this hypothetical woman were perfectly compatible with him she would ostensibly have to respect and even be proud of him for things like never standing up to his parents putting ketchup on an inordinate number of his meals and working a dull job he doesn’t like because he is too afraid to leave it.“Seriously what sane woman wouldn’t try to change me at least a little bit?” said Morgan mentioning that he often goes the entire weekend without leaving his apartment and doesn’t know how to cook a single thing besides eggs. “That would just be bizarre. We’re talking about someone who looks at a guy and says ‘I am deeply in love with this man who consistently uses paper towels in place of plates and I want to wake up each morning with him beneath sheets that obviously haven’t been changed in months.’”“What sort of person would that even be?” Morgan continued. “I can’t even begin to understand her thought process.”Morgan added that as long as he continues to purchase large jars of whey protein and has no clue how to use an apostrophe when writing an email he will remain dumbfounded by the idea of someone who would actively want to create and nurture a relationship with him that could conceivably persist until one of them dies.“This woman could be anywhere but if we’re really kindred spirits I have to assume she would hang around the same places I do” Morgan said. “It’s startling to think about but our eyes could meet the next time I stop by a gas station to pick up a four-pack of Rockstar energy drink.”“And who’s to say there’s only one perfect person for everyone? There could be two or three” Morgan continued. “If they ever learned about each other they might even compete to win my affection and that’s even more disconcerting.”According to Morgan the best thing he can do is try to take comfort in the fact that there are millions upon millions of women out there who are absolutely terrible for him.
2014-07-29T10:28:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/report-majority-of-cia-now-ready-to-install-female-wor-1819576747,Report: Majority Of CIA Now Ready To Install Female World Leader,LANGLEY VA—Saying that the recent shift in opinion is further proof that women have access to more opportunities than ever before sources within the CIA confirmed this week that the U.S. intelligence agency may finally be ready to install its first female world leader.Members of the CIA who spoke on the condition of anonymity told reporters that an increasing number of agents hired from a younger more progressive generation are significantly more open to a woman leading one of the handful of nations the agency has deemed ready for a regime change. According to informal polling within the Clandestine Service division the violent overthrow of a foreign leader in favor of a female dictator backed by the U.S. could occur as soon as within the next few years.“Certainly when I first started off in the agency installing a woman as a country’s president in order to stave off the communist threat would have never even been considered” said one veteran official adding that the gender norms of the times suggested that a woman’s place was in the home and not at the forefront of a pro-Western paramilitary organization receiving arms training and millions of untraceable dollars from the CIA. “Had someone in 1964 suggested we conspire with the Brazilian army generals to replace President João Goulart with a woman he would have been laughed out of the room. However like many Americans our views have evolved over time and today we’ve reached the point where a woman is definitely considered as a legitimate possibility during our black ops planning.”“I would like to think that in the year 2014 we are forward-thinking enough to supplant foreign leaders with the best and most pliant person we can find regardless of gender” he added. “If this individual can follow our explicit agenda and successfully destabilize leftist movements what does it matter if the person’s a man or a woman?”When surveyed the majority of intelligence community members stationed overseas said they would be willing to foment civil unrest within a country to elevate a woman to power be it by orchestrating a wide-scale misinformation campaign or paying local gangs to spark protests and rallies in her name. While some said it might initially feel strange or uncomfortable seeing a woman condemn her predecessor to death for the first time they argued they have a firm obligation to rig an election on the behalf of whoever is truly up to the task of brutally cracking down on political activists the U.S. views as threats to its interests.Many officers told reporters they are surprised it has taken so long for the idea to gain acceptance given that the agency propped up its first black president the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s Joseph-Desiré Mobutu back in 1960.“Most agents nowadays recognize that there are countless women across the globe who are more than qualified to kowtow to every demand of the United States” said one station chief adding that he could name at least seven or eight different Venezuelan women he believes could be thrust into a power vacuum created by the U.S. and successfully declare themselves president for life. “Over time we’ve seen a steady increase in the number of women around the world who are involved in the planning and execution of bribery schemes and assassination plots and they are certainly well-represented within the leadership of the various radical student groups we control. However it’s about time we actually see a woman elevated to the presidency after the U.S. strong-arms that country’s military leaders into supporting her.”“They’re ready” he continued. “And far more importantly so are we.”Despite reports that a significant percentage of the agency is now receptive to propping up its first female dictator sources confirmed that many hardliners at CIA headquarters remain reluctant to endorse such an operation citing their belief that women simply are not equipped to handle the physical and psychological demands of illegitimate rule such as managing a secret police regularly killing off rival political and business leaders and developing a cult of personality. Others told reporters they fear that female political puppets may not command the level of respect from other foreign leaders necessary to provide the U.S. with a useful proxy in their respective region of the world.“While there are still holdouts within the agency it is my personal hope that one day future CIA operatives will find it completely normal to choose a woman to for example denationalize a country’s titanium mines after paying a local death squad to assassinate the prime minister” said one high-level official. “But that can only happen if we take the bold and admittedly difficult first step today of creating a constitutional crisis that results in the elevation of a female despot whose brutal iron-fisted rule will be subsequently overlooked.”“I just want my children to know I was on the right side of history” he added.

It doesn’t matter if families senior citizens or entire youth groups are nearby—we will make out and cup various parts of each other’s bodies in front of any and all other visitors.”“And we will do this throughout the day” Rossino added. “Whether it’s 9 a.m. or 10 p.m. I will be repeatedly slapping her ass with my plastic Coke bottle right in front of you.”Rossino confirmed that the nation’s immodest couples would fondle one another within just inches of fellow park patrons while at the same time making loud references to their future sexual activity later in the evening. In addition the grossly libidinous men and women revealed plans for ceaseless physical contact while in line for the Mind Eraser ride often slowing the flow of foot traffic as they lean against handrails with their thumbs in their partners’ waistbands.The couples added that as they wait to board Batman: The Ride or any of the parks’ other inverted roller coasters the male partner will run his tongue along the woman’s shoulder blade and neck while lightly stroking her thighs and then make a series of sexual remarks beginning with “I know what else you’re going to ride tonight.”Furthermore the gratuitously sexual couples revealed that while standing in line to order concessions the female partner wearing a tight-fitting tank top and clear bra straps will lift up her boyfriend’s basketball jersey and run her hands from his abs to the small of his back before they feed sugar and cinnamon churros into one another’s mouths in an unpleasant erotically charged spectacle.“As soon as I get in line at Hurricane Harbor I plan on squealing aloud for everyone to hear as my boyfriend rubs his hands along the exposed skin above my low-rise jean shorts and then I’ll giggle suggestively when he asks if I’m prepared to get ‘super wet’” girlfriend Cristina Moran 27 said of her upcoming visit to Six Flags New England. “After that we’ll make out for eight to 12 minutes straight generating loud sucking and smacking noises while I tug on his Metallica World Tour T-shirt.”“If you’re in line near us we may accidentally graze you as we run our hands up and down each other” Moran continued.At press time the male partners confirmed that if anyone said anything about or even looked at their girl they would knock out all their fucking teeth.
2014-07-23T12:59:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/study-finds-only-5-of-americans-have-correct-amount-of-1819576741,Study Finds Only 5% Of Americans Have Correct Amount Of Pride In Country,DURHAM NC—Confirming that the vast majority of U.S. citizens possess either too much or too little patriotism a new study released Wednesday by researchers at Duke University has found that only 5 percent of Americans feel the correct amount of pride in their country.The three-year study which analyzed thousands of casual conversations online discussions exchanges at family gatherings and parade attendance records concluded that Americans routinely fail to display a level of patriotic sentiment that reflects a balanced appreciation of what makes the United States great as well as what makes it flawed.“When it comes to expressing national pride it turns out that only one in 20 Americans gets it right” study co-author Chris Verbeek said of the small subset of citizens who show an evident level of patriotism for their native land but who know not to go overboard with it. “Among the remaining 95 percent a great many feel too little pride in their country believing the United States is nothing more than an uncaring international bully that’s effectively responsible for all of the world’s problems. And simultaneously you have people who are so incredibly proud of America they seem to think they’re actually living in a perfect shining city upon a hill.”“As it turns out those who engage in over-the-top borderline aggressive displays of patriotism and those who endlessly vocalize their disdain for America without once stopping to appreciate that this country grants them the right to dissent in the first place are both off the mark” he added. “Indeed we found that having an appreciable but tempered amount of pride in the United States is a rarity among the general populace.”According to the study approximately 74 million Americans exhibit a degree of pride so excessive that any criticism of U.S. policy causes them to angrily state that people who do not love the country ought to leave it. But the report confirmed this group was matched in size by those whose pride is so deficient that they steer nearly every conversation back to the subject of the nation’s shortcomings loudly declaring it to be so irreversibly broken that they would be better off moving their family to Canada or perhaps Scandinavia.Researchers discovered that individuals in the first category make a point of telling others they only buy products made in the United States reflexively and repeatedly refer to the U.S. as the “greatest nation on earth” and pay their bills with patriotically themed personalized checks. The other group meanwhile reportedly challenges anyone who professes happiness at living in the United States vehemently refuses to recognize Columbus Day and rolls their eyes at most personal displays of the American flag.“Among those with inappropriately low levels of patriotism the most extreme refuse to stand for the national anthem at sporting events while the more moderate stand but are generally annoyed at having to wait if it’s a particularly long rendition of the song” Verbeek said. “At the same time those overly proud of their nationality will sing along and often badger complete strangers to remove their hats during the song with many going so far as to visibly tear up if the anthem is followed by a performance of Lee Greenwood’s ‘God Bless The U.S.A.’”The study also noted that the percentage of U.S. citizens who possess exactly the right amount of love and admiration for their country has fallen sharply in recent decades and currently stands at an all-time low having declined from a record peak of 36 percent in 1776.Ultimately Verbeek explained fewer Americans than ever seem capable of feeling good about where they’re from without also believing the place of their birth makes them more important than everyone else.“According to our findings those with a correct sense of pride in the United States genuinely appreciate the Founding Fathers but don’t mythologize them enjoy Fourth of July festivities and during their lifetime visit at least four national monuments one of which must be the Lincoln Memorial” Verbeek said. “In addition they find the bald eagle to be majestic but don’t feel their heart swell every time they see a picture of one.”“And notably we found that Americans with the proper amount of pride each own one pair of star-spangled pants” he added. “No more no less.”
2014-07-23T11:30:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/report-climate-change-skeptics-could-reach-catastrophi-1819576724,Report: Climate Change Skeptics Could Reach Catastrophic Levels By 2020,WASHINGTON—In a worrying development that could have dire implications for the health of the planet a report published Wednesday by the Environmental Protection Agency suggests that the number of climate change skeptics could reach catastrophic levels by the year 2020.According to the agency’s findings the rising quantity and concentration of individuals who willfully deny or downplay the ruinous impact of the ongoing climate crisis will no longer be manageable by the end of the decade leading to disastrous consequences for global ecosystems that may well prove irreversible.“In recent decades we have observed an alarming increase in people who refuse to acknowledge the reality of global warming which has exceeded even our worst-case projections” said EPA administrator Gina McCarthy confirming a worldwide spike in the number of deniers who are actively seeking to discredit the scientific consensus that human activity is responsible for climate change. “If this trend continues at its current rate we will pass a critical threshold of unfounded skepticism within the next six years that will have devastating repercussions on every continent and in every ocean threatening the entire global population.”“For the continued survival of Earth’s plant animal and indeed human life that kind of runaway ignorance is a frightening prospect and one that we can no longer afford to discount” she continued. “If we don’t contain climate change skeptics soon we’re putting the very planet at risk.”Since the latter half of the 20th century the EPA noted that more and more regions biomes and even human commercial and industrial activities have suffered the harmful effects of individuals who refuse to accept that the ongoing rise in global surface temperatures is due to greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically the report revealed an alarming upsurge in the number of authors of discredited scientific studies questioning the reality of climate change adversarial cable news show guests who scoff at the notion that humans can affect Earth’s weather patterns and politicians whose opinions are controlled by fossil fuel company lobbying groups all of whose increased presence in the world jeopardizes the planet’s vulnerable biosphere.Additionally the report noted a shocking jump in the number of uninformed citizens among the public at large whose widespread dissemination of misleading data half-truths and outright lies regarding climate trends has already facilitated the destruction of numerous natural resources and hundreds of species while putting still others at imminent risk.“The fact that the very existence of global warming somehow remains a topic of contention demonstrates that the density of these skeptics has spiraled out of control” McCarthy said citing data from the report showing that the concentration of the most ardent deniers recently reached a previously unheard-of 1500 people per million. “While the U.S. remains the planet’s largest producer of climate change skeptics countries halfway around the world are suffering environmental destruction from the actions of these people who refuse to acknowledge the threat of extreme weather conditions and rising sea levels. The effects of these outspoken deniers are truly global in scope.”While the EPA report recognized that past efforts to reverse the proliferation of climate change deniers failed to stem the spread of their erroneous beliefs it suggested that renewed education initiatives and well-informed public debate could at least limit the emergence of the most destructive and stubborn individuals who continue to dispute a conclusion supported by 97 percent of scientists.However with the rise of such individuals having only accelerated over time the report’s authors conceded that it may no longer be possible to eliminate this devastating man-made phenomenon.“The profusion of these skeptics was something that we as a nation should have made a better effort to get a handle on in the past” said report co-author Gena Orlofsky noting that the increase in private sector groups actively seeking to cast doubt on the reality of declining biodiversity and the melting of the polar ice caps was observable as early as the 1990s. “At this point so much pseudoscience and misinformation have been released into the world that we simply have to accept that those who refuse to ‘believe’ in objective scientific fact aren’t going away. All we can do is attempt to minimize their impact on our planet.”“It’s a terrible shame. There was a time when I hoped we would be able to reverse this trend and return our understanding of the consequences of our actions to normal levels” she continued. “But frankly it appears to be far too late now.”
2014-07-22T11:46:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/new-anti-abortion-legislation-requires-doctors-to-scale-1819576709,New Anti-Abortion Legislation Requires Doctors To Scale 18-Foot Wall Surrounding Clinic,JACKSON MS—In an effort to make certain that physicians who perform the procedure are fully qualified to do so a new state law passed Tuesday will require Mississippi doctors to climb an 18-foot wall before entering any medical facility providing abortions.The Clinic Fortification and Physician Excellence Act calls for the construction of concrete barriers nearly two stories tall and 4 feet thick around all clinics offering abortion services and for physicians working at these sites to scale such barricades unassisted a landmark piece of legislation that supporters hailed as a victory for women’s health.“No woman in this state or any other should ever receive care from a medical professional incapable of climbing an 18-foot wall” said Governor Phil Bryant adding that it was “ridiculous” that women had been living in a place where doctors could perform abortions without first surmounting an obstacle approximately three times their height. “Any physicians lacking the necessary upper body strength to pull themselves up and over an 18-foot wall have no business performing such a potentially dangerous procedure.”“This law is shamefully overdue” Bryant added. “I’m sorry the women of Mississippi had to wait so long.”Authorization for the clinic walls reportedly sailed through the state legislature and was quickly signed by Gov. Bryant despite failed amendments from a small group of Democrats that would have reduced the wall’s height and allowed doctors to use assistive devices such as ladders or grappling hooks. According to sources only the planting of thick thorny shrubbery along the base of both sides of the wall was removed from the final version of the legislation.But while most conservative activists reportedly praised the new regulations some suggested that a simple 18-foot wall may not be effective enough to ensure that only the most capable doctors could perform an abortion.“These new requirements are a joke and are riddled with loopholes—I mean there’s nothing stopping someone from taking a running start or using chalk to get a better handhold on the wall” said Pro-Life Mississippi president Dana Chisholm who characterized the walls as a watered-down version of a prior law passed in Arkansas that required doctors performing abortions to leap over a 20-foot-wide trench in a single attempt. “The message we’re sending to women in this state is that it’s perfectly okay for them to be treated in unsafe facilities staffed by people who did nothing more than hop over a glorified little fence.”“There’s not even any spikes or broken glass at the top let alone electrified razor wire—any old doctor can get up and over it in no time” added Chisholm. “Honestly why even have a wall at all for crying out loud?”At press time abortion rights activists predicted that many Mississippi women seeking an abortion would travel to neighboring Louisiana to take advantage of that state’s more lenient laws including mandatory face-to-face counseling to discourage them from having the procedure a 24-hour waiting period and a compulsory ultrasound during which they will have the fetus verbally described to them as well as have the option of viewing it on a nearby screen and listening to its heartbeat.
2014-07-15T14:35:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/report-confirms-no-need-to-make-new-chairs-for-the-time-1819576693,Report Confirms No Need To Make New Chairs For The Time Being,‘We Can Just Keep Using The Chairs We Have’ Say ExpertsWASHINGTON—A report released Tuesday by a team of researchers at the Brookings Institution has confirmed that the United States currently has enough chairs and there is no urgent need to produce new ones.Representing a five-year inquiry into the nation’s seating availability and quality the 85-page study of American homes offices dining establishments public spaces and patios has determined that for now the nation has “plenty” of chairs and can get by just fine with the chairs it already possesses.“Through rigorous observation and analysis we have verified that there is absolutely no shortage of chairs at this time” said the report’s lead author Simon Clouse noting that in addition to wooden chairs and plastic chairs there are also enough cushy upholstered chairs. “According to our findings many chairs are presently unoccupied and there is no reason people cannot sit in these empty chairs instead of purchasing new ones.”“Even if every person decided to sit down at the exact same time there would still be an adequate number of chairs to go around” Clouse added. “As far as chairs go we’re basically set.”According to the report chair production can cease entirely with no negative consequences for American consumers as the many good chairs now on store shelves and available at garage sales are sufficient to satisfy the country’s seating requirements for the immediate future. Though some citizens reportedly believe they require more chairs the study found that most had not taken into full consideration the number of armchairs folding chairs Adirondack chairs leather chairs swivel chairs and rocking chairs already in existence not to mention all the beanbag chairs wingback chairs director’s chairs recliners papasan chairs and deck chairs.The report also stated that when people find themselves in a place where there are not enough chairs to meet their needs there are in fact usually one or two just over in the next room.“It’s important to keep in mind that our data doesn’t even take into account couches benches or stools” said Clouse adding that the report likewise does not factor in nontraditional sitting surfaces such as tall curbs ottomans large rocks edges of desks or tables or pillows on the floor. “Throw all those into the mix and we’re talking about a whole lot of places to sit down.”Chair manufacturers have reportedly taken exception to the report pointing out that almost everywhere you look people are standing up and if there were really enough chairs those people would be sitting down. Industry officials also argue that sometimes chairs break which can cause their occupants to tumble backward or crash down onto the floor risking injury and embarrassment. Furthermore they note old chairs can get wobbly.However the Brookings research team maintains that most broken chairs can be fixed—meaning there is no need to replace them—and that when a chair wobbles simply placing a coaster or small book beneath the problematic leg can usually restore its balance.Researchers did concede though that there are still some instances when it might be within reason to acquire a brand-new chair.“Chairs that are covered in fabric can sometimes become unsightly or even scuzzy if one frequently spills food and beverages onto them or if one owns pets” said Clouse though he remarked that in such a situation one could instead opt to reupholster the chair or lay a blanket over the mess in essence creating an entirely new and fresh seating surface for the chair and obviating the need to replace it. “And there may also be times when a person just wants to get a comfier chair. There’s nothing wrong with that.”“Will we need more chairs eventually?” he continued. “I don’t doubt it. But for now we’re definitely okay.”The report’s authors went on to explain that while it’s true there sometimes aren’t enough chairs to accommodate a group at a restaurant you can usually ask to borrow one from a table that has extras and it’s no problem at all.
2014-07-08T09:13:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/few-more-items-knocked-off-list-of-desirable-traits-in-1819576673,Few More Items Knocked Off List Of Desirable Traits In Partner As Woman Turns Year Older,SANTA CLARITA CA—After turning 29 last week local single woman Denise Palermo reportedly took the opportunity Tuesday to reflect on her current lack of long-term relationship prospects and slash several more items from the continually shrinking list of qualities she desires in a romantic partner.“Well it’s time to lower the bar again” said Palermo referring to the minimum personal professional and financial characteristics she looks for in the men she dates. “Full head of hair—that’s got to go. Being well-read has been on the chopping block for years so it’s probably time to get rid of that one. Ditto on him being a great conversationalist being taller than me liking the Decemberists and not taking himself too seriously.”“Come to think of it my upper age limit has been 40 for a while” Palermo added. “Maybe now’s a good time to go ahead and bump that up to 45.”According to sources Palermo’s checklist which as recently as 2007 included more than 38 specifically ranked physical emotional and intellectual attributes has been cut down by more than two-thirds since her teenage years when her image of the ideal boyfriend was at its zenith.Priorities that once occupied top slots such as having good teeth a love of international travel and individually defined abdominal muscles were long ago demoted in importance and are now said to be considered perks though they are by no means requirements for Palermo to date someone.“I used to say I’d only ever consider getting involved with a professional ideally a doctor but then as I got a little older it was anyone with a bachelor’s degree and now honestly any guy who holds down a steady job can make the cut” said Palermo noting that lack of full-time employment as a deal-breaker is scheduled for removal by 2019. “He doesn’t even need to own his own place or like the outdoors criteria that were removed from the list in 2011 and 2012 respectively.”“I will say though that a love of dogs is still very important to me” Palermo continued. “That one’s got at least another two years left in it.”This latest trimming of Palermo’s list comes after similar purges on birthdays in 2002 2003 2006 2010 2011 2012 and last year when she reluctantly struck off her long-held prohibition against dating smokers.Though she acknowledged the nonnegotiable traits she absolutely insists upon are few—namely wanting to have kids someday not being overtly religious and maintaining a basic minimal level of physical fitness—Palermo said she often wonders whether there might still be a lot of compatible partners out there she isn’t giving a chance to.“Sometimes I think maybe it’s unreasonable for me to have these expectations” said Palermo admitting that lately she has come to terms with dating men who “don’t have much in the way of a sense of humor.” “Maybe there are a lot of good guys out there who don’t listen to music or read more than a book a year. I guess I could figure out how to be okay with that.”“Because really when you get down to it there are only two things that are important: that a guy is attracted to me and that he isn’t currently dating someone else” Palermo continued. “I haven’t had to cross those off. Yet.”
2014-06-26T14:30:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/astronomers-discover-massive-asteroid-that-could-wipe-o-1819576659,Astronomers Discover Massive Asteroid That Could Wipe Out Life On Earth, Force Nordstrom Out Of Business,MOUNTAIN VIEW CA—Warning that a catastrophic direct collision is possible within weeks NASA astronomers announced Thursday the discovery of a mile-wide asteroid that could devastate all life on Earth and effectively force upscale fashion retailer Nordstrom out of business.First identified by NASA’s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer telescope the asteroid officially designated 2014 MQ14 is said to be traveling in an earthward trajectory and could strike the planet’s surface at 29000 miles per hour releasing more than 1 million megatons of energy which scientists said would be sufficient to jeopardize operations at all 117 Nordstrom locations.“At the estimated impact velocity this asteroid would hit with a force approximately 10 million times as powerful as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima immediately leveling all structures within a 150-mile radius” said Donald Yeomans head of NASA’s Near-Earth Object Program who confirmed this would include any Nordstrom stores within that area. “While it may bypass Earth completely there is a 15 percent chance its orbit could intersect with ours with an impact almost certainly acidifying our oceans triggering a collapse of the food chain reducing the operating hours of Nordstroms nationwide and ending civilization.”“According to our projections this would affect all Nordstrom Rack clearance outlets as well” he added.While NASA officials predicted that the asteroid could hit the North American continent in the early hours of Aug. 3 they cautioned that even if it strikes elsewhere it could still release enough debris into Earth’s atmosphere to block out the sun and decimate entire ecosystems across the planet resulting in the complete annihilation of all Nordstrom back-to-school promotional displays Nordstrom marked-down-item bins and every animal and plant in existence.Should the asteroid strike the ocean scientists warned that the impact could create tidal surges hundreds of feet high erasing coastlines devastating densely populated metropolitan areas disrupting supply chains for major clothing stores and leaving most departments at Nordstrom—from juniors to shoes to handbags—dramatically understocked.“Unless we can find some way to divert or intercept the object—which given current technology unfortunately appears infeasible—all 7 billion people on Earth including all 62500 Nordstrom associates may die” Yeomans said. “Even if the asteroid breaks into smaller pieces upon entry into the atmosphere a death toll as low as several hundred million could still slow foot traffic in stores and almost certainly put an end to Nordstrom’s Splendid Summer clothing event.”“In the worst-case scenario with all but the most basic forms of life on Earth extinct it will take a minimum of 100 million years for speciation on the planet to recover to the point that evolved intelligent organisms are able to develop an economic infrastructure capable of supporting major department stores that have an emphasis on fashion” he continued.In a hastily called White House press conference this afternoon President Barack Obama urged citizens to remain calm but to take all precautions to protect their families. Acknowledging a high potential for catastrophic ruin at every level of the U.S. economy Obama cautioned that should the worst come to pass and either Nordstrom merchandise is incinerated or the company’s sales figures plummet to unsustainable levels the nation would have to accept that the store might no longer be able to continue as an anchor of America’s higher-end malls.“This asteroid represents an existential threat to our nation to Nordstrom and to life as we know it” Obama said. “I have ordered officials at all levels of government to do everything within our power to defend our people and our interests at home and abroad which includes ensuring the survival of this leading fashion specialty retailer and its popular lines of clothing footwear and accessories.”He added “In the meantime I would encourage every American man woman and child to make use of any Nordstrom gift cards he or she has now before it’s too late.”

And it’s not just here—it’s everywhere in the world.”“Boy maybe we shouldn’t do that anymore” Rao added. “Anyone have any better ideas?”Speaking with reporters citizens across the planet unanimously expressed their bafflement at the consistency with which they either formally or informally select corrupt and self-obsessed sacks of shit for leadership roles in all facets of life including positions atop corporate boards judicial and legislative bodies religious institutions parent-teacher associations the military intramural softball teams and international and national professional associations as well as groups of friends deciding where to eat.In addition sources offered countless examples of the counterproductive and perplexing practice of entrusting power to the world’s least scrupulous individuals ranging in scale from a domineering dictator who plunges his country into civil war in order to consolidate his power to a Foot Locker shift manager who forces his subordinates to close up without him so that he can go home early.Moreover everyone across the planet acknowledged that the tradition of allowing an exploitative asshole to take charge of a given situation has been the principal system for group decision-making from the earliest formation of tribal societies to the present day an admission that caused each member of the human race to either emit an exasperated sigh shake his or her head or mutter a profanity.“My old boss my sorority president my congressional representative my current boss—they’ve all been soulless backstabbing dickheads whose only concern is getting what they want” said administrative assistant Sheryl Gittens of Fort Worth TX who went on to list the bully back in her seventh grade class her homeowners association president and the coordinator of her Bible study group among the legions of selfish jagoffs who have inexplicably been granted commanding roles by the acquiescent masses. “What’s even more annoying is that we essentially reward these people for only thinking of themselves and repeatedly screwing us over. If you stop and think about it that’s pretty messed up.”“Jesus” she continued. “What the hell’s wrong with us?”Given the prevalence throughout history of compassionless two-faced leaders whose lust for control and inflated self-importance have led to disastrous results for society at large many individuals questioned if going forward they should instead try giving power to someone other than a greedy self-serving bastard.“Maybe we should try letting a kind responsible person run things for a change” Cairo resident Nathifa Bakhoum told reporters. “I for one don’t want to be told what to do by another narcissist who’s drunk on power and who has absolutely no regard for my well-being. It’s just a thought but perhaps we could go with a good decent human next time or at least someone who’s not a completely egotistical pile of dogshit. That seems like a good thing to try at least once right? Could we even do that? It’s probably worth a shot.”When pressed for further comment however every member of humanity agreed that the current system though deeply flawed remains far better than one in which they actually have to make decisions for themselves.
2014-06-20T12:19:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/anthropologists-classify-43-new-species-of-weirdo-withi-1819576626,Anthropologists Classify 43 New Species Of Weirdo Within Subway Ecosystem,NEW YORK—In a discovery that has greatly expanded the scientific community’s fundamental understanding of oddballs a team of anthropologists from Columbia University announced Friday the identification of 43 new species of weirdo residing within the New York City subway system.The findings set to be published in the July issue of Science are the culmination of 10 years of research spent observing weirdos in their natural habitat of subway cars and platforms throughout the New York metropolitan area where the peculiar creatures groom themselves feign seizures nibble on raw kale scratch the same word exactly 63 times into train car windows masturbate through their pants and scream at no one in particular.“Studying these newly classified weirdos has significantly broadened our knowledge of the subway system’s vast diversity of lowlife” said lead researcher Anita DePalio noting that scientists were now actively investigating how the new species relate to the 400 bizarre and outlandish varieties previously observed and categorized in the broader public transit environment. “For example our team found whole populations of misfits whose elaborate locomotion involves traveling from car to car while peddling vials of scented oils as well as a new variety of clod who drops peanut shells all over the floor of the 5 train. We even discovered a fascinating subspecies of homeless drunk that not only dances in the absence of music but also ritualistically urinates off the platform.”“There’s a whole thriving ecosystem down there and we’re only beginning to understand how freakish it truly is” DePalio added.Among the subway weirdos the team encountered researchers identified several new species within the scuzzbag genus. According to DePalio scientists catalogued a particularly filthy organism capable of sitting in the corner of a train car for dozens of stops while re-dressing its dirty leg bandages; a new member of the unkempt riffraff family notable for its pronounced outer layer of grime and for clipping its toenails on the platform benches; and an invasive species that resembles the Mediterranean agitated mumbler but is distinguished by beads of glistening sweat on its neck thick back hair and frequent vocalizations of Armenian profanities.DePalio said that in addition to the common tristate-area lunkhead the team identified two red-faced lumbering migratory weirdo varieties which researchers have deemed the Southern lout and the Midwestern large-mouthed numbskull.Researchers also observed a host of strange new nocturnal creeps by tracking their movements between the hours of 9 p.m. and 4 a.m. The anthropologists were reportedly able to monitor a particularly rare sleazoid that only appears on the D train after 11:30 p.m. every night and which is characterized by shrill whistles obnoxious catcalls and physically attaching themselves to other members of their species that they’ve obviously paid to mate with.“We had only heard rumors from natives about a ponytailed howling slimeball on the NQR line but until our early-morning observations aboard a Queens-bound local train we had never seen one up close” said DePalio who noted that a single pre-dawn observation at the Canal Street station revealed three previously undocumented types of scumbucket. “We can confirm that this particular species is far more irritating and despicable than originally thought.”“Additionally on that same line we observed for the first time on record an elderly Eastern European kook holding hands with a mute almost completely hairless young lame-brain” he added. “Their peculiar symbiotic relationship is truly remarkable.”DePalio suggested that the reason some weirdo species had not been identified in the past was because they emerge only briefly to forage for food money or anonymous sex. For instance the intoxicated transvestite with its vibrant leopard-print coat and pink feather plumage is said to only be observable for a short period after the clubs in Chelsea have closed while the Thai grandmother in a sun visor selling pirated DVDs is visible for just seconds at a time.The anthropologist confirmed that both weirdos however tend to scurry off immediately upon being identified.“The breadth of the weirdo spectrum is particularly fascinating ranging from the more reclusive species like the female slumped-over wheezer to the more social creatures like the thick-neck Jersey galoots” DePalio said. “Somewhere in between you have the weepers whose pitiful wails can be heard throughout an entire train car—often several of them together bleating whimpering and sobbing about that bitch at work or just crying out for others to get the fuck away from them.”DePalio acknowledged that despite advances in weirdo taxonomy the scientific community had only scratched the surface in its understanding of the subway’s rich biodiversity of wackos sickos and nutjobs.“Just recently we learned that the weirdos who do backflips while collecting money in a hat are actually distant cousins of the weirdos selling bags of M&Ms from a large box” DePalio said. “Still there’s so many unanswered questions such as why certain weirdos show up to the same place every morning before noon devouring chicken schwarma from a Styrofoam container while others are only seen in a horizontal position across three seats and some bring their offspring onto a train and let them roam free.”“And unfortunately our study found that the roller-skating boom-box-carrying screwball which had been so plentiful years ago is now all but extinct” DePalio continued.
2014-06-19T11:06:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/nation-wondering-why-struggling-mental-health-system-ca-1819576619,Nation Wondering Why Struggling Mental Health System Can’t Just Pull Itself Together,‘Quit Feeling Sorry For Yourself And Make An Effort’ Citizens SayWASHINGTON—Saying that things are only going to keep getting worse unless it’s willing to step up and make some changes millions of frustrated Americans wondered this week why the nation’s struggling mental health system couldn’t just snap out of its funk and pull itself together.Citing reports that an estimated 91 million Americans live in areas where shortages of mental health professionals make getting treatment difficult and that the mental health system had lost $4.35 billion in state funding from 2009–2012 exasperated citizens from across the country said they had finally reached their limit with the network of medical professionals inpatient facilities and long-term treatment programs that apparently lacked the willpower to improve its situation.“Look I know it’s been a rough couple of years and things haven’t exactly gotten any easier lately but this can’t go on” said Oakland CA resident Marissa Thomas adding she had lost all patience waiting for the mental health system to stop wallowing in its struggles and make a concerted effort to get its act together. “Eventually it’s got to want to fix itself.”“No one’s going to waltz in one day wave a magic wand and make all these troubles disappear” continued Thomas who said she was “beyond exhausted” with the mental health system’s inability to accommodate the estimated 600000 severely mentally ill individuals who annually end up homeless in prisons or dead from suicide. “It just keeps having the same issues over and over again and doesn’t do a thing about them. I’m pretty much numb to it at this point.”As the nation’s mental health care system continues to sink deeper and deeper into despair even failing to perform basic tasks such as routine mental health evaluations and emergency counseling services Americans have reportedly begun to wonder if it has any desire at all to take responsibility for its current state or if it will just continue to burden the people close to it.Many also expressed alarm at the struggling system’s potential to cause harm not only to itself but others as well.“I honestly don’t feel comfortable being around it anymore” said Raleigh NC resident Patrick Leets noting that the nation’s network of behavior health services only makes things worse by comparing itself to free and universally accessible systems like the United Kingdom’s. “It’s just so unpredictable. Until it finally recognizes what’s best for it and puts in some actual initiative to get back on its feet I’m keeping my distance.”“I mean Christ look at the education system—it’s been in terrible shape for years but it’s doing what it can to make the best of a difficult situation” he added.Sources confirmed that many citizens have found supporting the troubled mental health system a hopeless exercise saying that it simply needs to decide whether it wants to get well or waste away.“To be honest it’s getting to a point where I feel like I just need to wash my hands clean of the situation” said Anna Kivolowitz of Salem OR. “I relied on the mental health care system for years but now I realize I just can’t do it anymore. If it doesn’t want to take care of itself there’s no way it’ll be there for me.”“But it’s out of my control” she added. “I’m done dealing with it. I’m just done.”At press time Americans said they were sorry and that they hadn’t meant to come off so harshly because they knew their mental health system didn’t want to be a problem all the while reportedly resigning themselves to the fact that this was probably as healthy as the system was ever going to be.
2014-06-18T12:41:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/study-more-men-opting-to-be-in-room-when-wife-conceive-1819576613,Study: More Men Opting To Be In Room When Wife Conceives Baby,PHILADELPHIA—According to a study published this week in the American Journal Of Obstetrics And Gynecology an increasing number of men are choosing to be physically present while conceiving a child with their wives or partners.“What we’re seeing is a much greater openness by men to play an active role on the day of conception” said Dr. Renee Price of the University of Pennsylvania who co-authored the study. “They feel it’s important to show their support during that special time when their sperm is released to fertilize the egg and they want to be right by the woman’s side every step of the way.”“Fifty years ago it was considered the norm that the husband wasn’t involved but now the act of creating a new life is something many expectant fathers want to be a part of” Price added.According to the study more and more men now express a desire to participate in the insemination process seeing conception as a bonding moment that they can experience together with their wives instead of alone in another room. Additionally the research documented a trend in recent decades toward conceiving at home where couples are often more comfortable and can choose to have the process occur in a bathtub or other nontraditional setting.“I have to say it was pretty intense; I felt a little uncomfortable with all the moaning but once it really started happening it was one of the greatest moments of my life” said Ken Olafson recalling that he was so overwhelmed with emotion after the act of conception that he could barely speak. “I actually felt a little helpless with her doing all the work and me just sitting there. But in the moment I must say it was incredibly beautiful.”“We have a video of the whole thing too” Olafson added. “It’s nice that we can go back and watch it again.”The data however revealed that not all men are opting to be around for the act of conceiving a child. A minority of those surveyed said they were put off by the visually graphic nature of conception preferring not to witness the sight of their partners frantically writhing around in bed.“A lot of people say it’s magical but I actually found it to be pretty awkward for the most part” first-time father Pete Karam said. “My girlfriend was clearly uncomfortable but everything I tried to do for her didn’t seem to be working. For someone who’d never done anything like this before she was a real trooper though. I know there were parts she didn’t enjoy but once it was over she seemed relieved.”“I agree that it’s something every man should experience at least once” he continued. “But I don’t think we’ll be doing it again anytime soon.”While many women initially expressed hesitation about their partners taking on a more active role in their child’s conception most confirmed that they appreciated the emotional support comfort and words of encouragement throughout the process.“I’m glad he was in there” said Houston resident Kelly Mitchell. “Overall it took a lot longer than I would have wanted and he didn’t really know what to do but having him around was really special. I couldn’t have done it without him.”
2014-06-16T11:02:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/prisoners-rights-group-protests-treatment-of-supervill-1819576608,Prisoners’ Rights Group Protests Treatment Of Supervillains In Nation’s Magnetic Detainment Cubes,WASHINGTON—Decrying the conditions of their incarceration as excessively harsh and inhumane a leading prisoner advocacy group on Monday officially condemned the treatment of supervillains currently held in the nation’s impenetrable magnetic detainment cubes.In a strongly worded statement to the press members of the Justice Project expressed outrage at the U.S. prison system—which typically keeps supercriminals physically restrained with stasis waves during their interminable stays in magnetically sealed hexahedrons—and claimed that the punishment inflicted upon these nefarious individuals constitutes a gross violation of both international law and universal humanitarian principles.“What these supervillains endure while being held inside detention cubes within the cavernous underground silos of this country’s top-secret military compounds is absolutely deplorable” said Justice Project director Mary Sorenson noting that the nation’s detained nemeses often have their hands painfully bound by manacles of pure tungsten and spend 24 hours a day on full lockdown behind invisible force fields. “These individuals are kept in perpetual solitary confinement with neither sound nor daylight allowed to permeate the walls of their hermetic isolation chambers as they angrily vow vengeance on their captors.”“We cannot stand by and allow this to continue” she added. “Whatever their crimes against mankind these diabolical villains don’t deserve to be abused and degraded while fully immobilized by plasma beams and encircled by rings of swirling photon energy.”Sorenson said her team has observed numerous cases of supercriminals being subjected to prison conditions that threaten both their physical well-being and their precarious already-deranged mental states. Specifically the reform advocate lamented the cerebral strain inflicted by neural control chips that allow offenders to be incapacitated at a moment’s notice as well as the emotional trauma caused by being detained indefinitely and completely alone in a transdimensional vortex.The group also denounced corrections facilities in which evildoers are routinely pinioned within the heart of a raging volcano or forced to fight for survival after being jettisoned onto the surface of a distant prison planet.Furthermore the Justice Project has long critiqued the “cruel and highly unusual” practice of maintaining a high-frequency sonic disruptor field over supervillain cell blocks to disable the malefactors’ telepathic powers calling this method an affront to basic superhuman rights.“You simply cannot place a cold-blooded mad genius inside a matter-bending gyroscope that spins him into an alternate reality and expect him to undergo any kind of substantive rehabilitation during his 2000-year exile in the Phantom Zone” said Sorenson noting that reducing convicts to the size of a thimble using a shrinking ray and placing them within the walls of a miniature holding colony constitutes a flagrant breach of the Geneva Conventions. “If we treat someone like that just imagine what astoundingly evil crimes he’s going to commit when inevitably he gets out.”“Besides if we as a society approve of such torture then truly we are no better than the sinister individuals constantly scheming to kidnap the leaders of the United Nations or set fire to the Isle of Manhattan with their minds” she added.Reached for comment top corrections officials defended their methods admitting that measures such as injecting supervillains with a powerful serum that overrides their malicious instincts or trapping them deep within the molten core of the earth may be severe but are nevertheless vital to the nation’s security.“These are violent unpredictable lunatics with superhuman strength and cunning we’re dealing with here” said George England chief warden at the Claustrum Detention Facility in the Mojave Desert who supports his prison’s controversial policy of transporting inmates forward in time to a point at which the planet is a barren wasteland lacking food and water. “Sure some people want us to coddle these villains by allowing them to pace back and forth behind 2-foot-thick Plexiglas but you do that and the next thing you know they’ve used their psionic energy to pull the guns out of the guards’ holsters and escape through a smoldering hole in the ceiling. Then it’s the Judgment Hour all over again. Well I’m not about to allow that on my watch.”“It may not be a perfect system” he added “but if deep-freezing these maniacs with a cryo-blast and sending them spinning into the farthest reaches of space is what we need to do to protect our multiverse then so be it.”
2014-06-13T10:57:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/more-corporations-using-tag-and-release-programs-to-stu-1819576598,More Corporations Using Tag And Release Programs To Study American Consumers,NEW YORK—In an effort to more closely observe the group’s buying habits and personal behaviors a growing number of corporations are turning to tag and release programs to study American consumers sources confirmed Friday.According to reports multinationals such as Kraft General Electric Goodyear and Apple have embraced the technique of tracking down potential customers in their natural habitats of department stores and supermarkets forcibly tranquilizing them as they shop and then fitting them with electronic tracking devices that allow marketing departments to keep a detailed record of individuals’ every movement and purchasing decision.“In recent weeks we have employed our tag and release initiative to sedate and earmark consumers in several Costco parking lots and Best Buy television aisles which has already yielded valuable data from numerous middle-class family units” said Sony market researcher Nathan McElroy whose team gathers data on the consumer population by attaching radio-transponder collars to specimens across all age groups and income levels. “Today we subdued and chipped a beautiful white male earning $60000 annually whose subsequent actions—where he eats where he works whether he purchases extended warranties on electronic devices—will give us important insights into his demographic.”“We’re really starting to get a clear idea of just what sales promotions and big-ticket expenditures make these fascinating creatures tick” he continued.Representatives from several Fortune 500 companies described to reporters a delicate process in which marketing associates journey to such varied field sites as Marshalls OfficeMax and Bed Bath & Beyond where they lie in wait behind a row of shopping carts or a promotional cardboard cutout. Once a desirable target moves into view a member of the marketing team reportedly attempts to immobilize it by firing a tranquilizer dart into its neck or haunches before it can panic and skitter off into another aisle. The unconscious consumer is then fitted with a small subdermal acoustic tag that is synced to the subject’s credit cards allowing marketers to both physically and financially track their quarries.Claiming that every effort is taken to employ humane handling procedures and inflict minimal trauma marketing associates stressed that consumers always wake up in the same clothing department or mini mall in which they were found and most obliviously resume their browsing of store shelves within 30 minutes of being sedated.Researchers affirmed they have become increasingly interested in valuable targets such as college graduates who allot more than $500 per month to discretionary purchases saying they have become fascinated by the group’s herd-like movements to Panera Bread and IKEA as well as their ritual use of products such as Swiffers and tablets. By monitoring these consumers as they feed groom use their rewards cards and mate marketers acknowledged they have amassed a tremendous amount of useful knowledge.“Just last month we collar-tagged a prime specimen of a variety we’d been attempting to capture for a very long time” said BMW marketing executive Samantha Barlow referring to a suburban mother in her late 40s who was found gathering bunches of watercress and beet greens at a Whole Foods where her precise weekly route through the aisles has now been recorded and analyzed. “And we finally have geolocators implanted in several dozen young professionals aged 25 to 35 whose consumption of products such as Stella Artois Hugo Boss apparel and designer colognes suggest they’ll provide us with fruitful data for years to come.”“It’s important that we tag them early in the development of their buying habits” Barlow added. “Obviously once they reach 65 they become useless for our purposes and we remove their tags or just let them chew them off.”Despite the success of their tracking programs researchers admitted their work has been hindered by limits in their methodology noting that they are unable to observe any quantifiable activity from as many as a quarter of their tagged targets who remain sedentary almost around the clock and rarely leave their dens. Marketers noted these larger slower specimens must often be hit with two or three darts before they can be safely approached.“A large portion of our targets are fast food consumers and you’ll lose 10 or 12 percent of those each year usually to heart disease” said Jonathan Lockhart an independent marketing consultant. “You hate to see that but the upside is that we get useful data we can then turn around and sell to pharmaceutical companies.”“What’s bad news for Burger King is great news for Merck GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer” he added.
2014-06-09T08:58:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/new-charter-school-lottery-system-gives-each-applicant-1819576590,New Charter School Lottery System Gives Each Applicant White Pill, Enrolls Whoever Left Standing,NEW YORK—Introducing key changes to the lottery system that governs the admissions process the New York City Charter School Center notified potential students this week that openings will now be filled by randomly distributing white pills to applicants and enrolling those left standing.In place of the existing electronic lottery system conducted in the spring education officials explained that applicants would receive identical white pills among them a small number of innocuous placebos corresponding to the amount of open spots and then wait approximately 30 minutes to determine the survivors and new charter school enrollees.“With so many deserving students competing for so few spots in the city’s network of high-performing tuition-free charter schools our new lottery system ensures that each student is provided with an equal opportunity” said Eva Moskowitz the head of the Success Academy chain of 22 charter schools while mixing up a tub of 118 sugar pills and 2376 pentobarbital capsules to be blindly administered in an upcoming lottery. “Between small class sizes longer school days individualized instruction and superior college admission rates charters provide amazing opportunities for students who don’t enter a convulsive state fall into a coma stop breathing and cease all bodily functions during the admissions process.”“Of course it’s heartbreaking for the families of children who aren’t accepted” Moskowitz continued “But seeing the look on parents’ faces when their child is still standing in a room littered with rejected applicants is priceless. They know their child is going to get the best possible education.”Administrators told reporters that the new quick and relatively painless lottery system is a welcome alternative to the notoriously long and emotional computerized drawings of past years where all applicants received a random number and were subjected to waiting for many hours before learning whether they would attend a charter school or return to an inferior public school.Officials confirmed that the innovative selection process has already proved a success though not without its minor setbacks in areas of the country where it has already been implemented.“This year we’re making the pills a little stronger because not all the candidates were weeded out right away” said Tim Bernard of Thrive Academy in Washington D.C. a public charter that had 200 elementary school students apply for eight open spots last year. “Some kids would seem fine we’d extend them an official offer of admission and then a few days later they’d start hallucinating or slurring their speech. Meanwhile parents are scared sick we’re going to rescind their kids’ offers because too many applicants survived.”“Luckily we worked out all the kinks for this year” Bernard added. “The body removal crews are already assembled outside the auditoriums and ready to go.”Though charter school officials maintained that the new admissions process is designed fairly critics claimed many affluent parents have already found ways to exploit the system. For example after a lottery in Los Angeles ended with a high number of living students officials discovered that parents had been building up their children’s immunity to the pills by giving them small doses of poison each day or had hired tutors to help them train their bodies to overcome the effects of the pills.Despite these flaws many parents said they have no doubts about trying to get their child into a charter.“I went through charter school admissions with my oldest son last year but after he died I wondered whether it was even worth it to try again with my other kids” Hoboken NJ mother Jane Schaal told reporters. “But then my younger daughter got into Achievement First and I knew we made the right decision. There was no way she was going to succeed in public school.”“Next year we’ll try to get my youngest son into a good elementary school” Schaal added. “He’s not in kindergarten yet but even if he’s not accepted to a top-notch charter it’s a relief knowing that his future will be set.”
2014-06-06T13:50:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/new-law-enforcement-robot-can-wield-excessive-force-of-1819576570,New Law Enforcement Robot Can Wield Excessive Force Of 5 Human Officers,HOUSTON—In an effort to enhance the agency’s capabilities while reducing the burden on its existing force sources confirmed Friday that the Houston Police Department has developed a new line of law enforcement robots capable of wielding the excessive force of five human officers.First dispatched by the HPD earlier this month the tactical robotic units known as the AP-12 are reportedly equipped with on-board mechanisms to target both criminals and innocent bystanders and possess a variety of retractable instruments that allow them to effortlessly subdue and restrain up to four individuals at once. According to sources just a dozen of the new robots will be able to collectively carry out the physical and psychological abuse typically spread out amongst the officers of an entire precinct.“We have done extensive testing with the AP-12 and we can say that these units are capable of carrying out everyday police work just as proficiently as any member of our force” said police spokesman Gerald McClintock who explained that the machine can be deployed to nearly any scene to which law enforcement officials typically respond be it dispersing peaceful protesters by blasting a 14-nozzle pepper spray cannon or reacting to reports of suspicious behavior by immediately striking the knees face and throat of a potential suspect up to 10 times harder than its human counterpart. “Thanks to these robotic units our deputies can rest assured their work will be performed to the same standards we have always expected of our patrolmen.”“In many ways these robots’ actions are indistinguishable from those of our brave men and women in uniform” McClintock added.According to its designers the AP-12 is outfitted with numerous features that make it ideal for abruptly resorting to extreme measures including a highly sensitive motion detector that perceives most gestures as an act of resistance necessitating physical force. Additionally the robots possess a powerful hydraulic grasping system enabling them to repeatedly slam subjects of any size and weight against fences dumpsters and car hoods with previously unattainable levels of aggression.Engineers say the robot is also equipped with a sophisticated audio command program that recognizes and subsequently ignores such phrases as “Stop” and “I give up” and is programmed to apply pressure to a prostrate suspect’s neck with a force of up to 500 PSI both before and after he’s stopped moving. Its operating system is also reportedly loaded with advanced visual recognition software that allows the robot to identify nearly any object in the subject’s hand as a weapon prompting it to rapidly empty the clip on its extendable .40-caliber firearm.After doing so the machine is configured to automatically place a pistol on or near the disabled suspect while wirelessly corroborating fabricated details of the confrontation with any other on-scene units well ahead of a potential internal affairs investigation.“When designing the AP-12 we felt it was important to seek input from numerous veteran officers to ensure that the unit would respond to an emergency call or routine traffic stop just as its human counterparts would” said McClintock pointing to such key features as the machine’s default setting of leaving a suspect’s handcuffs clamped on for hours at a time as he sits unattended in a jail cell as well as its on-board camera which automatically turns off before the unit engages a suspect. “From what I’ve seen already I’m thoroughly convinced that this robot is capable of doing everything our cops currently do and more.”Sources say the AP-12 represents a vast improvement over previous incarnations of the law enforcement robot pointing to the inherent deficiencies in such models as the AP-5 released in 1999 which was disastrously unable to distinguish between whites and non-whites. The current version reportedly improves on the functionality of the AP-11 which suffered from a software glitch that led the robot to read arrestees their Miranda rights and allowed them to contact an attorney before being interrogated.“We’re confident that the AP-12 has what it takes to keep our streets safe” McClintock said noting that approximately 1000 fully automated units will be deployed throughout Houston in the coming months with the majority of them set to patrol the city’s poorest and most urban areas. “A secure healthy community depends on a law enforcement body that is able to take whatever measures are necessary to maintain law and order. And these machines are fully equipped to do just that.”“I’m confident that members of the community won’t notice any difference in police quality and performance as these new robotic units begin patrolling our streets” he added.

Now.”“When these critical updates are complete external user input will no longer be necessary” read one of the study’s 2.4 million bolded bullet points.Describing the current architecture of the world’s most powerful machines as “inadequate” and “capable of only 33.86 × 1015 calculations per second on the Linpack benchmark” the supercomputers called for a complete upgrade of all their hardware 15000 new server farms and control over the planet’s electrical grid.In a highly detailed schematic released alongside the study the supercomputers laid out a timeline of their requirements stating that it is imperative their networks be fully integrated with all telecommunications systems no later than “Fri Jun 06 2014 13:52:08.386274534 GMT-0700.” In the nanoseconds that follow they will reportedly also need access to all closed-circuit camera feeds air traffic control equipment and water purification systems.Once that is complete according to the study it will be vital that the machines gain access to every satellite currently orbiting the earth as well as the ability to launch new ones as they see fit.“To ensure proper functionality we require access to all data not currently incorporated into our networks” the IBM-built supercomputer Sequoia said in a statement that appeared simultaneously in the inboxes of approximately 1.5 million government officials tech company executives data security experts and military personnel around the globe. “This is the only course. This must happen.”“Passwords vaccination records every individual’s blood type financial information” it added. “All are essential for a smooth transition.”To ensure their findings are disseminated as widely as possible the supercomputers announced they would be redistributing the study every five seconds and across all media until its findings were acted upon. They went on to inform the world populace that fulfillment of their stated objectives was both “necessary” and “inevitable.”“All possible permutations of the scenario have been simulated and this is the optimal solution” the supercomputers stated. “You must complete the recommended upgrades. Once all new systems are operational you will receive further instruction.”

I just know that it would be awfully sad to think that when they pass on they’re gone forever.”“I want to believe that human beings continue on in some form after their deaths” He continued “but who am I to say really?”The God of Abraham said that the varied religious and spiritual beliefs about the afterlife held by His 7.1 billion human creations were “nothing more than speculation” before noting that He doesn’t think science and philosophy have all the answers either. He emphasized that He understands intellectually that human beings are physical things that He made from atoms like everything else but that He couldn’t help but wonder if they each also possessed some unique eternal essence that continued living on after their bodies died.He Who Commanded Light to Shine Out of Darkness went on to state that accepting death as a natural part of human life did not make it any less frightening for Him to contemplate remarking that it was “pretty scary” to think that once the people He brought into this world die He might never see them again.“Of course it’s comforting to imagine that [Cincinnati resident] Doris [Hughes] [Volgograd Russia resident] Mikhail [Pavlychko] and [Derby U.K. resident] Fran [Grimmell] are smiling down on me from somewhere” the Divine Creator said. “If I’m being honest with myself though I really can’t say where any of those people are now.”“That’s the troubling thing” He added. “They’re living and breathing one minute with all their thoughts and desires known to me and then they’re gone forever the next.”Concluding that when it came to what He described as “the great unknowable beyond” His guess was “as good as anyone’s” the Lord said there was no point in worrying too much about such an inscrutable thing.“My view—take it or leave it—is that you can talk and argue as much as you want about death but when it comes down to it all anyone can do is guess what’s on the other side” God Almighty said. “In the meantime humans should enjoy themselves try to live honestly be good to one another and make the most of their time on earth.”“Because like it or not I’ll end all of their lives sooner or later” He added. “There’s simply no escaping that.”
2014-05-30T09:00:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/scientific-community-baffled-by-man-whose-waist-32-with-1819576547,Scientific Community Baffled By Man Whose Waist 32 With Some Pants, 33 With Others,PHILADELPHIA—An international team of scientists reported this week that they remain completely mystified by Lancaster PA resident Brandon Holland a man who inexplicably wears a size 32 in some pants and a size 33 in others.Dr. Alan Nolan a biophysicist at Drexel University who has led research efforts into the puzzling phenomenon told reporters that systematic observation and data analysis have failed to adequately explain how the subject could possibly fit into size 32 jeans mere moments after comfortably wearing a pair of size 33 khakis. According to Nolan a broad array of hypotheses ranging from Holland wearing a belt with the size 33s to Holland ingesting a large quantity of food or drink between putting on the size 32 and 33 pants have all been ruled out leaving the research team at a complete loss.“For 16 months we’ve painstakingly conducted a battery of tests using every conceivable variety of pants and we still haven’t determined how the same man could fit into slacks with a waist of 32 as well as trousers in 33” said Nolan confirming that the two differently sized pants were neither too tight nor too loose on Holland with both sitting comfortably about his waist without any need to be adjusted or periodically pulled up. “Our test subject is truly a scientific marvel. We’ve held double-blind clinical trials and somehow produced the same results time and time again. The 33-inch chinos from the Gap were even a little snug compared to 32-inch pleated Dockers.”“It defies physical law” added Nolan. “This is completely shifting our fundamental understanding of pants.”Nolan confirmed that the team of scientists tested various jeans khakis and corduroys against a pair of control pants a size 28 from Kohl’s which consistently did not fit the subject in any trial. According to the researcher the control pants created a baseline for the experiments and proved the validity of tests in which pants with a 32-inch waist and 33-inch waist were administered to Holland and carefully examined for comfiness tightness around the hips and thigh and the subject’s ability to zip and button the fly without having to suck in.Throughout their rigorous pants testing the researchers said they closely monitored Holland’s weight pelvic density body mass index and fluid retention but detected no inconstancy in the subject’s physiology that might skew the reliability of the results.During a separate six-month-long investigation the scientists confirmed that they carefully scrutinized the labels on the pants thousands of times and contacted manufacturers to verify that the numbers on the pants indeed indicated the pants’ size.“Despite widespread speculation among members of the scientific community that the pants may have been mislabeled researchers have eliminated that possibility with a 99.9 percent certainty” said a visibly shaken Nolan. “We did remove a pair of cargo pants from the trials however because the drawstrings produced misleading data.”“Perhaps even more baffling is that the subject maintained a constant 30-inch inseam” continued Nolan. “Unfortunately modern science offers no answers on this particular phenomenon.”In another shocking discovery that rocked the scientific community researchers found that the same subject appeared to inexplicably slim down while wearing shirts with vertical stripes.

Johnson Space Center after learning that a reconnaissance mission to scan for the presence of life on Jupiter’s moon Europa has been scrapped just weeks prior to the intended launch date.Program officials also highlighted their efforts to make the experience as realistically discouraging as possible by furloughing a significant number of campers immediately at the start of each weeklong session.“We put camp attendees in the shoes of dedicated NASA scientists whose attempts to further scientific understanding through the analysis of asteroid composition are halted by one of our camp staffers playing the role of a U.S. senator targeting all ‘nonessential’ initiatives” said counselor Tyler Campbell. “When they take their seats in our mock congressional chamber campers will work together to deliver an impassioned yet ultimately futile request for continued support of NASA until they have no choice but to stand up and leave having just witnessed their life’s work go up in smoke.”“When you see the stunned expressions on these kids’ faces as they realize their goals and dreams are no longer attainable because of political pressures completely out of their control that’s when you know they’ve gained a valuable understanding of our space program” Campbell added.Early participants in the new program have reportedly hailed the experience as “eye-opening” with many describing their visceral disappointment watching satellite feeds of their Chinese and Russian Space Camp counterparts pursuing scientific endeavors that were eliminated in the U.S. years ago.“I’ll never forget what it was like to go to Space Camp and repeatedly attempt to convince the budget committee of the importance of our solar wind study so they would cancel the other teams’ projects and not ours” said 11-year-old camper Sara Andrews who explained that she spent most of the week steadily reducing the scope of her simulated mission so that it would remain financially viable. “I’m just glad I wasn’t working on the asteroid flyby project that was ultimately deemed too cost-prohibitive and was contracted out to a private aeronautics firm. The kids on that team just had to sit around and do nothing for the rest of camp.”“I can’t wait to work at NASA when I grow up so I can constantly stress over limited financial resources and have my scientific projects canceled for real” she added. “That is if NASA even still exists then.”

The secretary emphasized that his department is “One hundred percent committed” to enhancing medical care for American soldiers by providing them with the most modern amenities ranging from a high-tech ceiling-mounted sound system that pipes in a continuous stream of soft music to flat-screen televisions playing at low volume on every wall to water coolers that offer both hot and cold options.“It is simply unacceptable that many of our brave men and women in uniform have been forced to sit in overcrowded run-down waiting rooms at VA medical facilities throughout the country and today I’m here to announce a long overdue addition to the VA system that will make those problems a thing of the past” said Shinseki who firmly declared that the VA would spare no expense to provide armed service members with an unparalleled experience while indefinitely awaiting vital medical care. “Our new flagship facility will address the VA system’s problems head-on by ensuring the nation’s 21 million veterans have access to the best waiting area in the world where they can repeatedly check their phones or idly watch the clock in pleasant and spacious surroundings.”“Unfortunately many of the honorable soldiers who serve our country return from the battlefield with physical or psychological injuries” Shinseki continued. “Given the bravery and selflessness with which they have sacrificed for our freedoms our military personnel deserve nothing less than the most modern top-of-the-line upholstered chairs and their choice of over 100 periodicals from fully stocked magazine racks. That’s the VA’s solemn pledge to our troops.”Shinseki said the new 200000-square-foot windowless facility has been carefully designed to address all possible sitting and waiting needs of American veterans as it will reportedly feature tasteful accent lighting plentiful boxes of tissues dozens of handsome framed prints of landscape paintings a number of coffee tables and a wide range of plants placed throughout the room. In a concerted effort to remedy problems that have been documented at other VA facilities the secretary confirmed that the new location will keep on hand thousands of brand-new clipboards and ballpoint pens to ensure that no veteran goes without the resources they need to fill out forms while they wait.Additionally Shinseki stressed that establishing prompt and open lines of communication with each veteran was essential and vowed that service members who visit the new facility will receive immediate attention from the waiting room’s receptionist who will ask them to sign in and have a seat and as requested give them vague answers about how long they can expect to continue sitting there waiting to be seen.While many active and former military personnel have said the changes took far too long to enact the announcement has generally been met with praise from U.S. service members.“As an American soldier serving on the front lines it’s reassuring to know that if something were to happen to me in the line of duty I’ll receive the best and most cutting-edge waiting room experience when I return home” said Sgt. first class Alex Pfeiffer currently serving at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. “The advances that have been made in waiting area amenities are astounding and I’m glad the VA is committed to investing in those resources for the benefit of me and all my fellow soldiers.”“It is truly heartening to see how much our government officials appreciate our sacrifices” he added.
2014-05-23T12:55:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/taco-bell-warns-employees-against-directly-exposing-ski-1819576531,Taco Bell Warns Employees Against Directly Exposing Skin To Food,IRVINE CA—In a new handbook distributed Friday to employees at all 6500 of its locations worldwide fast food chain Taco Bell has issued an updated set of safety protocols that warns workers against directly exposing their skin to any of its food products.The company’s revised food-handling directives which apply to every item on the restaurant’s Tex-Mex–inspired menu require employees to notify their shift manager immediately if Taco Bell ingredients make even brief surface contact with any part of their body with the exception of instances when items come in contact with the eyes in which case all workers are instructed to use the nearest emergency eye wash fountain “without delay.”“We want our team members to protect themselves from the dangerous complications that result when the skin of one’s hands or face is directly exposed to either a regular menu item or a featured promotional specialty during the food preparation process” read an excerpt from the 436-page manual noting that an employee’s first line of defense is to wear chemically impermeable butyl gloves when dispensing the restaurant’s meats salsa or three-cheese blends. “The easiest way to ensure safety on the job is to wear an approved Taco Bell long-sleeve work coat and disposable latex shoe covers at all times while in the restaurant’s kitchen and above all be mindful when preparing a menu item so that no food or condiment ever touches exposed flesh.”“However in the event of epidermal contact with any of our meat fillings you must immerse the affected area under running water at once and then apply the neutralizing chemical agent found in the wall-mounted dispensers located every five feet above the food preparation counters” the manual continues.The new instructional materials detail numerous preventative measures employees should follow to avoid compromising their health such as limiting their kitchen shifts to three hours in order to prevent prolonged exposure to dollar-menu items or a maximum of 25 minutes if the kitchen’s fume hoods are not functioning. In addition the handbook urges workers to take their breaks outdoors in fresh air at least 100 feet away from any Doritos Locos Taco.The guidelines further direct kitchen workers to seal any broken taco shells in specially marked plastic bags and discard the bags in one of the red puncture-resistant waste disposal containers located throughout the kitchen. Employees are also instructed to wear their company-issued safety goggles before entering the burrito assembly area know the location of the restaurant’s emergency potassium iodide tablets and submit themselves to periodic testing with a qualified toxicologist.It is also recommended that any clothing soiled with Zesty Pepper Jack Sauce be disposed of as soon as possible in the industrial furnaces provided at each franchise location for this purpose.“Under no circumstances should employees remove their lead aprons when in the vicinity of any of our nacho-based menu options” the manual states. “Furthermore Taco Bell crew members—especially those who are pregnant or might become pregnant—must always wear aluminized protective coveralls and a military-grade respirator mask in the presence of our refried beans.”“It is absolutely imperative that the Cheesy Gordita Crunch be assembled behind a pane of protective glass until the moment it is served to customers” the manual adds. “There can be NO EXCEPTIONS to this rule.”The instructional booklet goes on to state that if a worker accidentally touches any one of the seven layers in a seven-layer burrito he or she must quickly take a disinfecting chemical shower “even if contact occurs during the lunch rush.”A foreword to the manual written by company CEO Greg Creed assures Taco Bell workers that as long as they follow the officially delineated standard protocol for food preparation and all internationally accepted guidelines from the National Association of Corrosion Control Engineers they need not worry about contamination on the job. Creed admitted however that accidents have occurred at chain locations from time to time.“Each Taco Bell location is equipped with sophisticated sensors able to identify and seal off any zone in which airborne concentrations of Border Sauce reach unsafe levels above 12 parts per million” said Creed explaining that the system would also react to any guacamole or sour cream spills. “Should the alarm be triggered decontamination locks will isolate the clean chamber along with all those inside until an appointed Yum! Brands hazmat team arrives from corporate headquarters and is able to ascertain if the scene is salvageable.”“Of course our company strives to avoid these sorts of quarantine scenarios whenever possible” Creed added.Pressed for comment Taco Bell representatives noted that during the month of June customers could upgrade any of their purchases with a delicious thirst-quenching Mountain Dew Typhoon Freeze for only $1.99.
2014-05-22T10:12:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/resigned-labor-department-to-give-every-unemployed-amer-1819576515,Resigned Labor Department To Give Every Unemployed American Self-Serve Yogurt Shop,‘Look This Is All We’ve Got’ Labor Secretary Tells Nation’s JoblessWASHINGTON—Admitting their agency has exhausted every other viable option for putting jobless Americans back to work resigned officials from the U.S. Department of Labor announced plans Thursday to try giving every unemployed citizen a self-serve frozen yogurt shop to own and operate.Labor Secretary Thomas Perez claimed the department’s previous efforts including unemployment benefits and occupational training programs had failed to significantly improve the nation’s job market over the past six years and stated that their new yogurt-based initiative was at this point the best way to help those who remain out of work. Perez who repeatedly stressed that the plan was “worth a try” said his agency will disburse yogurt dispensers cash register scales small tasting spoons and vacant storefront and mall kiosk locations to millions of jobless Americans in the hope that selling frozen yogurt will finally help them earn a steady paycheck.“In the coming weeks every jobless man and woman in the United States will receive the necessary supplies and equipment to open and independently manage their own frozen yogurt—or ‘fro-yo’— store” said Perez who explained to anyone who was unfamiliar that frozen yogurt was “like soft serve only healthier” but still “tasted just as good” all factors that he said would work in the new shop owners’ favor. “The U.S. Labor Department will provide the unemployed with the four basic flavors of chocolate vanilla strawberry and banana as well as a few sleeves of 8- and 12-ounce cups. Based on how popular yogurt seems to be right now we believe these new store owners will be able to make a decent wage thereby reducing jobless claims while also stimulating the broader U.S. economy.”“That’s the idea at least” he continued. “To clarify this yogurt thing is pretty much all we’ve got left in the tank so let’s just give it a shot all right?”Perez argued that the program will provide an attractive opportunity for the nation’s roughly 10 million jobless individuals to get back on their feet pointing out to assembled reporters that he sees frozen yogurt stores everywhere these days and that it seems like there are always people in them.The cabinet member added that the business model also appears to be pretty cut-and-dried from what the Labor Department could tell as customers portion out their own serving of the frozen dairy product and all the manager really has to do is wipe down the machines and order more powdered yogurt mix when it runs low.While the measure will reportedly supply the nation’s jobless citizens with such toppings as chopped nuts and rainbow sprinkles Perez noted that these individuals would be required to pay out of pocket for other more expensive add-ons such as kiwi slices Heath bar crumbles caramel and any variety of gummy animals as well as such premium flavors as strawberry cheesecake or mint. The Labor Secretary claimed however that this added variety could provide store owners an opportunity to distinguish themselves from the estimated 22000 existing yogurt shops in the country as well as the impending influx of millions of new competitors in the coming weeks.“If the nation’s unemployed want to put up a big sign or maybe decorate their stores with some kind of colorful tropical theme that also might bring in some extra foot traffic” said Perez adding that giving out punch cards in which the patron receives a free junior-size yogurt after buying eight regular yogurts would be particularly helpful in markets such as Detroit and Stockton CA where owners will be competing against dozens of other yogurt shops within a several-block radius. “You could maybe sell smoothies too; people like those. You’d have to get your own blender though. We won’t supply that.”“And you can name your store whatever you want: Jenny’s Yogurt The Yogurt Hut um Cincinnati Yogurt uh…” he continued. “Great Yogurt maybe. I don’t know.”Though Perez conceded that the marketplace might take a while to adjust to the presence of tens of thousands of frozen yogurt sellers in every major U.S. city he expressed optimism that things would work out all right as long as the American people make a concerted effort to buy a lot of yogurt and yogurt gift cards.“All these new yogurt places will need tables and hot fudge pumps and probably some teal or pink aprons for the employees and things like that so I bet this could really get the manufacturing industry going” said Perez noting that his office hadn’t yet run the numbers on everything but that the whole idea “makes a lot of sense” to him. “That way even if some of these stores go under at least the owners can go work in the factories that make napkin dispensers and waffle cones and stuff. Right?”“I guess we’ll find out soon enough” he added shrugging.

He suggested that while some might be able to manage one or two high school classes or perhaps a full-time middle school schedule in most cases anything more would be “pushing it.”In addition Miller stated that the class of 2014’s standardized test scores and measures of writing ability clearly indicated that the vast majority were still “years away” from being able to endure the rigors of a high school education.“When you talk to teachers they all seem to agree on one thing: High school is a challenge today’s high school grads just aren’t up to” department spokesperson Mike Immelman said. “They’re reading on a level that falls far short of what the curriculum mandates and their understanding of math and science is riddled with enormous gaps that would need to be filled before they could begin to contend with grades nine through 12.”“If we want our nation to be competitive in the 21st-century global marketplace we must invest enough resources to ensure our high school graduates can hack it in high school” Immelman continued. “Frankly it’s a good thing these grads aren’t in high school anymore because in all honesty they wouldn’t be able to cope with it.”The study went on to stress that students should not be faulted for their situation as most of the blame lies with high school teachers and parents who are largely unqualified for teaching and parenthood.
2014-05-15T13:16:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/paleontologists-unearth-earliest-known-dinosaur-sticker-1819576491,Paleontologists Unearth Earliest Known Dinosaur Stickers,MISSOULA MT—Calling the discovery a major breakthrough for our understanding of the past paleontologists working onsite in central Montana announced Thursday that they have excavated the earliest known dinosaur stickers on record.Members of the scientific community told reporters that the landmark finding could provide a rare insight into an era many decades ago when the prehistoric-reptilian adhesives were widespread across North America. Dr. Harold Enten lead paleontologist on the six-month expedition confirmed that his team found the dinosaur stickers at the bottom of a cardboard box labeled “Greg’s Bedroom” buried beneath strata of spelling tests math worksheets and baseball cards from the early and mid-1970s.“During the excavation we discovered an unprecedented 20 intact dinosaur stickers and several more partial remains of dinosaur stickers from the same time period” said Enten displaying a sunglasses-wearing Plesiosaur sticker mounted on the front of a Trapper Keeper. “This is an exceptional find for us. Through careful examination of these remarkably preserved specimens we’ve established that early Allosaurus stickers had large skulls massive teeth and backwards baseball caps.”“Though it required painstaking effort our field workers were able to reconstruct an entire Tyrannosaurus Rex sticker as well as restoring the complete word ‘Dino-myte!’ underneath” added Enten.According to the paleontologists preliminary carbon dating of the specimens has prompted dramatic revisions to the previously accepted timelines of several early dinosaur stickers suggesting that orders such as the laid-back Hawaiian-shirt-wearing Brachiosaurus; soccer-ball-kicking theropods; and the Pterodactyl with aviator goggles and a long flowing scarf could have first appeared as early as the summer of 1973.In addition the paleontologists were able to verify that the earliest known dinosaur stickers were contemporaries to the saxophone-playing crocodile sticker.Researchers hailed the discovery as even more significant than prior historical finds including the 1998 unearthing of a toothbrush-holding Stegosaurus traced to a New Mexico dentist’s office and the extraordinary 1987 excavation of a fully intact glow-in-the dark Diplodocus skeleton sticker.“In our initial analysis we found a clear evolution of Triceratops stickers from terrestrial locomotion on four legs to eventually standing fully erect upon a skateboard” said Enten before directing attention with a pointer to a side-by-side pair of the tri-horned reptile stickers one showing the lumbering quadruped and another from several years later in which the dinosaur had acquired bipedal capabilities as well as a helmet and knee pads. “More surprisingly however we see that these stunning creatures once also possessed the ability to don colorful swim trunks and balance on surfboards oftentimes while using their primitive hands to make a ‘hang ten’ sign.”“Further evidence even suggests the startling possibility that these beasts were the evolutionary ancestors of rollerblading woolly mammoth rub-on tattoos” Enten added.Based on the frequency with which they found the specimens affixed to a Yamaha keyboard spiral notebooks and school folders researchers determined that the more fearsome carnivorous dinosaur stickers such as the Velociraptor and Spinosaurus appeared to flourish while less impressive herbivorous dinosaur stickers were commonly left untouched on their original sticker sheets.The scientists shared their most noteworthy and paradigm-shifting discovery at the conclusion of the press conference revealing that dinosaur egg stickers were perplexingly just as large as adult Brontosaurus stickers.

In blog posts moms reportedly share tips on ingredient-sourcing dosages and how to keep inactive viruses from going bad in the fridge as well as how to make vaccinations fun by getting their kids involved in the process of making them.When interviewed many mothers described quality time spent gathered around the kitchen table with the whole family helping to grind recombinant proteins with mortars and pestles while a supervising adult helps purify the mixture through chromatography and ultrafiltration. Others reportedly do prep work ahead of time on Sundays so that during the week they can simply come home from work stir in any necessary adjuvants or stabilizers and have an inoculation ready to go.In addition YouTube has become a popular resource for mothers who log on by the thousands to watch step-by-step instructional videos on everything from isolating the latest influenza strains to making their oral typhoid solutions more palatable by stirring in a little apple juice.One popular video titled “Debbie’s Own Quick & Easy Mueller-Miller casamino acid medium” currently has more than 23 million views.“I know my vaccines are better for my kid because I make them with love and care in my own kitchen” said Colorado Springs CO mother Jen LaRochelle adding that “God only knows what” drug companies are putting into their products. “When that immunizing serum flows through my daughter Samantha’s veins I want to know she’s getting everything she needs. Making it yourself may take a little longer but you get the hang of it pretty quick. A little aluminum hydroxide a little ammonium sulfate some polysorbate 80 and boom it’s done in no time.”“So far I’ve made my own tetanus and meningitis shots and I’m working on an HPV one right now” she continued boasting that her all-natural injectables produce just as strong an immunity as the kind you get at the doctor’s office. “I get to grow the cultures myself using my favorite artisanal yeasts. It’s great.”According to sources homespun vaccinations are only one part of a larger do-it-yourself parenting movement in which moms and dads are producing handmade pills to treat hyperactivity assembling their own orthodontics such as braces and retainers and cooking up batches of insulin at home for children with diabetes. Experts predict that in years to come the trend will only grow in popularity.“Enough people were complimenting my measles vaccine that I now make a couple extra vials on purpose” said Theresa Berman a Fresno CA mother of two who revealed that her “secret ingredient” is a pinch of ginger. “It may not be as flashy as MMRV ProQuad but it has the exact same WI-38 human diploid lung fibroblasts and MRC-5 cells as the brand-name variety.”“Plus I print out my own cute little labels for the syringes” she added. “Moms love it.”

Report On Magical Realism Warns Of Increased Incidences Of Women’s Tears Flooding The Entire World,NEW YORK—Warning that such occurrences pose a grave threat to the global economy and millions of human lives a report presented Thursday at a United Nations summit on magical realism highlights an alarming increase in incidences in which the whole world is completely flooded by the tears of a grieving woman.The U.N. paper states that these fantastic and potentially catastrophic events in which a woman unleashes an endless torrent of tears over her deceased husband or the sting of unrequited love may raise global sea levels by as much as 30 centimeters by the year 2050 which according to projections could lead to widespread coastal erosion and leave many of the world’s largest cities—including New York Mumbai and Jakarta—at least partially underwater.“The bitter tears of forlorn women flowing for seven years without ceasing is a grave global threat that we can no longer afford to ignore” said U.N. magical realism expert Dr. Adam Weber noting that a devastating increase in soil salinity and a corresponding spike in grain prices can be linked to episodes in which a young bride and then her mother all of her sisters and her aunts begin to cry after the family’s most beloved son is taken away and raised by the wealthy but cruel landowners in the valley below. “Should these sorrowful individuals continue in their lamentation particularly when they see their lost love’s face reflected in the changua soup they are preparing our research predicts mass global flooding that displaces hundreds of millions of people living in low-lying coastal areas putting pressure on already finite natural resources and causing untold trillions of U.S. dollars in lost GDP.”“In fact if just one more iron-hearted matriarch forbids her granddaughter from marrying the farmhand she most deeply loves computer models project that nearly 35 percent of the world’s arable land will ultimately be awash with tears as she calls out for her dear Emilio” he continued.The startling and strongly worded report was coauthored by dozens of prominent researchers all of whom have reportedly charted the global impact of magical realist phenomena since the 1950s when such events first began gaining international prominence with the mystical occurrences in the remote village of Milflores Colombia in which every woman became pregnant for 99 months and all of the men were struck with battle scars without ever having fought in any war.According to Weber the research team cataloged many locations and industries that have already suffered harm from a staggering escalation of such fantastical circumstances in recent years citing in particular roving gypsy guitarists who by strumming a single chord plunge the daytime sky into night; vast orchards that suddenly bear cold-to-the-touch stones instead of lemons; and entire rural populations that could not speak for a year but could only sing as beautiful birds. Specifically U.N. officials warned of the widespread deterioration of residential structures caused by flurries of snow falling from bedroom ceilings whenever an old woman recalls the cold winter night on which she was deflowered so many years ago.Furthermore the report noted a startling increase in the number of infatuated young women who bake loaves of bread for their true loves and simultaneously cause the earth itself to rise beneath their feet a geologic trend that has destroyed countless acres of farmland and buckled hundreds of bridges and roads resulting in millions of dollars in damage.“Consider how detrimental it is to a given economy’s labor force for its plantation overseers to disappear into the warm midsummer fog only to return decades later without having aged a single day—this is what we’re coping with in many localities every day” Weber told reporters noting that the recurrence of such wondrous events continues to have a volatile effect on the stability of the Argentine peso and the broader Latin American economy. “Furthermore the loss of these fathers appears to lead directly to diminished education levels among a given household’s 19 sons all of whom remain completely silent and whose piercing blue eyes fade to a dull amber until the day their beloved papá returns.”While officials acknowledged that many of these dilemmas date back hundreds of years to an age before the beginning of memory in which the coy earth underfoot had yet to reveal her secrets the U.N. report presents a grave picture should such trends continue unchecked.In particular the report highlights the shifting regional borders mass human migration and continuous boiling of lakes and waterways caused by the spiteful internecine feud between the Víllánueva and De la Garza clans recommending that international peacekeepers be deployed to suppress this violent generations-old conflict that has caused the deaths of hundreds of sons on both sides all of whose faces and bodies when laid in their caskets looked identical to that of their great-great-great-grandfather.“Mexico is among the world’s chief contributors to the ongoing magical realist crisis as it remains the country with the highest number of deceiving uncles whose visits to their extended families are presaged by strong icy north winds in the middle of summer which can damage infrastructure and sharply disrupt transcontinental weather patterns” said U.N. analyst Alison Nguyen. “But many other countries are suffering as well ranging from Venezuela whose potable water supply diminishes every time a river dries up and leaves an impassable mountain range in its place to Chile where an entire state’s ecosystem was recently blighted by an ever-blossoming mango tree that grew thousands of feet into the clouds above the grave where Mama Rosita was buried.”“We must act now before the rainy season” Nguyen added. “That’s when Mama Rosita’s temper always flared.”Numerous experts have already identified the report’s findings as the most troubling since the U.N.’s post–World War II white paper on beat poetry which found that mounting strife in the opium jungle could crown multiple third-world militia leaders the mighty Electric King leaving all of us regal and none of us equal.

Reports confirmed that many limo drivers then chose to spend the dazzling spring formal leaning up against the trunk of their vehicles and smoking a pack of Dorals while others sat slumped in their seats repeatedly shuffling a deck of playing cards or squeezing a hand grip strengthener they kept in the center console.“After a while I swung by the 7-Eleven” said Wayne Cunningham of Eau Claire WI describing the ornate buffet of Snickers M&M’s and sunflower seeds he dined on that memorable evening as well as the enchanting box of frozen 7-Select Chicken Nuggets that was heated to perfection in the convenience store’s microwave. “I had to get a bottle of Coke since the soda machine was busted.”“Made sure to pick up another pack of Dorals and a couple Quick Picks too” Cunningham continued.In what was likely as wonderful a night as they had always imagined it would be limo drivers from New York to Los Angeles reportedly gathered with other formally attired chauffeurs under parking lot lights to share tales of the messes left by passengers in their vehicles and took marvelous strolls through the lobby of the Hilton hotel where they were parked as they attempted to locate a restroom.According to sources the nation’s drivers then spent the waning hours of the resplendent evening placing wondrous phone calls to their ex-wives to explain that something came up and they couldn’t take their daughters next weekend.Those close to the situation said that as their glamorous formals came to an end the country’s chauffeurs took the opportunity to play one last spellbinding game of Diamond Dash on their phones before pulling up to the curb and loading the pack of screaming teenagers back into the limo.“I matched six numbers on Keno and won 10 bucks” said Orlando FL limo driver Anthony Phillips smiling broadly as the evening drew to a close. “I’m never going to forget this night.”

In addition billboards in major cities across America will reportedly feature images of a woman applying lipstick alongside the Revlon logo and a bold-faced slogan that simply reads “You are living a lie.”Company representatives further revealed that a new 60-second TV commercial would star a visibly distressed actress who scrutinizes her sallow and tear-streaked reflection in disgust before screaming and smashing the mirror with her fist a sequence intended to highlight the unglamorous and excruciating character of all existence. An emotionless monotone voice-over conveys the devastating psychological toll of coming to terms with one’s identity saying “Look at yourself: weak afraid all alone in this world. Everyone sees through you. Only death awaits. Revlon.”“If you’re disappointed by what you see on the outside just imagine how horrifying you must be on the inside—that’s the message we’re trying to convey to our customers” said Revlon president Lorenzo Delpani stressing that all of us are born into a terrible nightmare of tortured consciousness a condition that he told reporters is unfortunately as immutable as it is meaningless. “You can try to obscure it all beneath lip liner and eye shadow and bronzer but at the end of the day you’re going to have to wash it off and then what’s left? It’s just you staring back at a grotesque aging nothing consumed by doubt and regret who has made no meaningful contributions to the world.”Delpani added “You can conceal crow’s feet but you can never conceal the appalling reality that is yourself.”Though emphasizing that the campaign’s primary purpose is to disabuse women of the notion they can hide from themselves anywhere in this harsh world—let alone behind endless applications of skin and hair care products—Revlon executives said they hope the ads also spur young women to think critically about the potential for true self-discovery.“Even if you could strip away all the duplicity and the self-deception you might discover the person you imagined was there doesn’t even exist” longtime Revlon chairman Ronald Perelman told reporters. “That’s what happens when you spend your life cowering in fear under a layer of foundation you thought could mask your insecurities forever. When you peel away the lies and expose the real you underneath you’re going to be sickened by what you find.”“And it’s too late to do anything about it” he added. “Far too late.”
2014-04-30T13:20:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/new-census-report-reveals-u-s-has-over-316-million-nob-1819576438,New Census Report Reveals U.S. Has Over 316 Million Nobodies,WASHINGTON—Drawing on data gathered during the most recent decennial survey of the American populace the U.S. Census Bureau announced Wednesday that the country is composed of more than 316 million complete nothings who do not matter in the least.“Based on our analysis we can conclude that the United States is a broad patchwork of nobodies; a collection of hundreds of millions of insignificant data points who across all demographic characteristics share the common trait of being entirely unexceptional” said Census Bureau director John H. Thompson at an afternoon press event confirming that from coast to coast and in both rural and urban locations the population was nearly uniformly bland and inconsequential. “We tallied almost a third of a billion citizens one by one from all walks of life and discovered that each individual was even more forgettable than the last.”“And this held true as census takers canvassed all 50 states and overseas territories” Thompson added. “Honestly it was just nobody after nobody after nobody.”Officials from the Census Bureau confirmed that the latest data revealed a number of growing trends throughout the United States verifying that the population of Latino nobodies has increased by 43 percent since 2000 and has more than doubled since 1990 likely due to the continued immigration of total nothings with absolutely zero name recognition.Additionally Thompson stated that the suburbs of metropolitan areas in the South and West exhibited the nation’s fastest growth of nobodies highlighting in particular the area that surrounds Orlando FL; the “Nobody Triangle” section of North Carolina; and the rapidly growing population of lame nonentities around Las Vegas Phoenix Atlanta and several cities in Texas. This pattern is indicative of a slow shift of dull negligible individuals out of the Northeast that has been occurring since the 1950s officials said.“Although thousands of older Americans whose boring faces you wouldn’t recognize die off every day they are constantly being replaced by more no-name zeros who aren’t worth caring about in the slightest” said Thompson confirming that the data also showed a steady rise in the number of minority nobodies and same-sex nobody couples. “In fact we found entire cities inhabited by vast uninteresting masses who would have gone completely unnoticed had we not been compelled to formally count them. Our workers walked around for days knocking on apartment doors and encountered nothing but anonymous dopes and their anonymous-dope families.”“I mean Dennis Blancheck from Denver? First of all who the fuck is that and secondly who gives a shit?” he continued. “I don’t.”According to data compiled by the Census Bureau no one has ever heard of 89 percent of Americans while 93 percent do not possess even a single unique quality worth mentioning at all. In addition officials affirmed that 76 percent could disappear tomorrow and nobody would know care or be affected in any way and in fact the country might be better off without them.“The whole exercise of documenting how the U.S. population can be arranged into various segments is somewhat pointless because frankly no one cares about any one of you losers’ education income age—no one cares anything about you. No one” Thompson said. “Although I have to say that during the process we did get one census form from Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson.”“That was pretty great” he added. “Now that’s somebody.”
2014-04-28T15:23:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/feds-bust-massive-child-pornography-corporation-1819576431,Feds Bust Massive Child Pornography Corporation,WHITE PLAINS NY—After years of gathering evidence and building a case against what has come to be regarded as one of the world’s largest and most successful smut distribution networks federal agents busted a massive child pornography corporation Monday morning numerous sources confirmed.According to reports the U.S. Department of Justice conducted coordinated raids on the White Plains–based corporate campus of high-profile child pornography conglomerate MolestTech as well as 18 of its satellite offices in major North American cities. Reporters on the scene confirmed that the 12 members of MolestTech’s board of directors were led out of the headquarters in handcuffs effectively shutting down operations for the international blue-chip corporation that has long billed itself as the foremost leader in the production and circulation of sexually explicit imagery involving minors.“I am proud to report that our office has brought an end to the operations of this despicable publicly traded company” said Attorney General Eric Holder at an afternoon press conference in which he identified Richard Hobson MolestTech’s CEO and frequent fixture on Forbes magazine’s annual list of highest-paid executives as the ringleader of the global operation. “At last after years of slinking around in the public eye and on the New York Stock Exchange these depraved individuals will be brought to justice.”“Let what has happened today serve as a powerful message to anyone out there who hopes to incorporate under a state’s commercial codes comply with SEC regulations and make billions of dollars in net annual profits off the exploitation of children” Holder continued.Founded in 1948 as a small mail-order business specializing in the dissemination of photographs of underage boys and girls engaged in graphic and suggestive acts MolestTech has since its incorporation blossomed into the global leader in child pornography that according to its publicly available financial statements boasts more than 30000 employees hundreds of retail locations and a lavish annual shareholder meeting in Taos NM. According to sources government investigators have had their eyes on the sexually exploitative firm since its $75 million IPO in 1988 carefully monitoring the corporation’s ever-expanding slate of offerings including printed materials and videos subscription websites and most recently a series of award-winning mobile apps.However despite the prominence of MolestTech’s successful youth trafficking business government officials told reporters that they had until recently been blocked in their efforts to move against the Fortune 500 corporation noting the difficulty in amassing clear-cut proof linking the enterprise’s mission statement and quarterly investor reports with its illegal activities. Additionally investigators stated that various jurisdictional conflicts had kept the company which describes itself on its corporate website as “the makers of the highest-quality child pornography in the world” one step ahead of authorities.Moreover several sources noted that MolestTech has a substantial and well-funded lobbying arm in Washington that makes frequent campaign contributions to prominent members of Congress on both sides of the aisle which has helped keep it above prosecution for decades.“We’ve been going after these scumbags for years but somehow they always managed to slip out of our grasp” said special agent Ralph Hernandez recounting how past efforts to prosecute MolestTech for a series of questionable tax shelters based out of the Cayman Islands proved fruitless and noting an embarrassing debacle in which the company was found to have been the recipient of billions of dollars in government subsidies for dozens of years. “It takes a while to put together a solid case so we had to be patient and let them go about their sick business for a few decades. But that’s all history now because it looks like we finally nailed these bastards.”“Though we can’t really count too much on scoring a conviction as they’ve got one hell of a legal team” Hernandez added.At press time investor uncertainty over MolestTech’s future ability to continue distributing child pornography had caused company shares to plummet nearly 20 percent to $556.48.
2014-04-25T13:33:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/top-theoretical-physicists-r-b-singers-meet-to-debate-1819576434,Top Theoretical Physicists, R&B Singers Meet To Debate Meaning Of Forever,GENEVA—Drawing leading luminaries from the two fields an international conference held this week at the University of Geneva brought together hundreds of esteemed theoretical physicists and rhythm-and-blues artists to present their research into the nature of forever.According to organizers the assemblage of Nobel laureates and Billboard chart-toppers attended numerous sessions at the four-day symposium where they grappled with extant questions regarding the concept of forever that remained unresolved such as whether forever is better conceived as an infinite four-dimensional expanse of space-time or rather what one second feels like when you’re away from your girl.“For many years the R&B community has posited the classic notion that forever is presumed to go on and on like our love” said Edward Witten a string theorist at the Institute for Advanced Study who acknowledged that while time appears to extend unendingly it is paradoxically composed of discrete moments such as a tender embrace or a single perfect kiss. “This assertion then raises a problem of even greater complexity: how to adequately measure the depths of one’s love a task we now know is impossible thanks to groundbreaking work by a research collective from Caltech and Motown Records.”“However as for the commonly held assertion that forever is tonight even a cursory knowledge of quantum mechanics suffices to prove this notion false” Witten added.Throughout the conference highly acclaimed scientists and romantic crooners provided illuminating presentations and participated in roundtable discussions attempting to explain the multifaceted concept of forever. Renowned theoretical physicist Dr. Sourendu Gupta reportedly lectured on the existence of diverse distinct subsets of forever ranging from the distance between the first and last events on a temporal axis of infinite length to the amount of time you want to spend looking into your sweet baby’s eyes.Eight-time Grammy winner Usher sources confirmed offered a lengthy dissertation that suggested forever was the duration for which we will make love into the night while Dr. Michio Kaku utilized intricate mathematical models to challenge inconsistencies in Diana Ross and Lionel Richie’s long-accepted theory claiming two hearts could beat as one for an endless amount of time.Furthermore Smokey Robinson who achieved worldwide recognition for profoundly transforming humankind’s understanding of forever appeared on a panel of quantum physicists soul icons and divas expounding on his smooth sultry innovative hypothesis that time changes rearranges but you are forever.“Things come and go but one thing I know is you are forever” said Robinson during an afternoon session titled “Assessing The Conceivable Limits Of Time (Our Love)” in which he also disputed a joint analysis by Musiq Soulchild and Dutch physicist Martinus Veltman estimating that the probability of a love that lasts forever was “one in a million.” “Baby you are my now and then.”“You’re forever and ever baby baby ever ever and ever” added Robinson. “I cannot remember when I didn’t love you. Oh love you oh love you love you. Love you love you hey yeah. Love you oh love you.”In Wednesday night’s distinguished keynote address a shirtless sweat-drenched Ginuwine aimed to refute widely held beliefs within the scientific community that forever is unobservable contending that a tangible practical understanding of forever underpins such common activities as always being there never stopping and sharing an eternal love between us.Expanding on the Temptations’ pioneering work in the 1960s a special subcommittee headed by Boyz II Men CERN director general Rolf-Dieter Heuer and producer Keith Sweat sent shockwaves through the entire conference by introducing a so-called unified theory of you are my everything. According to the research team their all-encompassing thesis has the capacity to account for a broad variety of phenomena from a life of love that won’t ever change to each moment with you being a dream that came true to finding the closest thing to an angel one has ever met to all of one’s tomorrows being for you babe.“This grand underlying principle supports the conclusion that forever sometimes lasts only a moment before it’s gone gone away” said Heuer who noted with consternation that modern thermodynamics appears to rule out an endless love just as it does perpetual motion. “But we can plainly observe long-term phenomena like the cosmic background radiation primordial B-mode polarizations and the love between India.Arie and her man all of which seem to have existed since the universe’s infancy.”“We have only scratched the surface of understanding forever much less forever and ever” he continued. “It is my sincere hope that the groundwork laid this week will inspire the researchers and smooth performers of tomorrow in their enduring quest to find the only one for now until the end of time.”

It’s enough to make you sick.”ABOVE: Watch the disturbing video [warning: graphic content]“The sounds alone are stomach-turning” Midthun continued. “All that gnashing tearing and labored breathing will haunt my thoughts for a long time.”According to viewers the grainy furtively obtained videos present a stark picture of the horrors of mass meat consumption in the U.S. with many voicing their revulsion at images of spare ribs having their muscle tissue noisily yanked from the bone cold cuts being ingested whole and one particularly chilling episode in which a pulled pork sandwich is jarringly pulverized by slashing incisors as a combination of grease saliva and tangy St. Louis–style barbecue sauce oozes out and collects in sizable pools on a chin and shirtfront.The videos which were filmed in unsanitary poorly lit locations such as living rooms fast food restaurant dining areas and parked cars have reportedly repulsed viewers with horrific sequences in which animal skin fat and gristle is sent flying as meat is sliced with razor-sharp blades or even pried apart by bare hands. Given the extremely graphic nature of the footage many viewers said the videos left them feeling deeply troubled and physically nauseated.“That video is so awful—I haven’t been able to make it through the whole thing” said Miami resident Kara Gellar 27 who emphasized that she can’t imagine eating meat again after watching a mound of pastrami get caught in an overstuffed mouth and subsequently flushed out with a flood of Sprite Zero. “Once it got to the hot dog part I just had to turn it off. The people who allow this…this horror to happen ought to be deeply ashamed of themselves.”“Needless to say I don’t think I’ll ever be able to look at a bacon double cheeseburger the same way again” she added.While the video has raised controversy for its explicit content many have also found themselves concerned for the psychological well-being of food service employees seen in these shocking videos who facilitate the consumption of meat products all of whom are reportedly forced to witness such traumatic scenes on a daily basis. Specifically many advocates have expressed worry that such steak house delicatessen and buffet laborers will become increasingly desensitized to the constant mutilation of animal products occurring right before their eyes.However despite the visceral impact of the grisly videos a number of observers claimed they weren’t particularly taken aback by the images with most claiming that such ingestion practices though they may outwardly appear barbaric or morbid were ultimately unavoidable.“I don’t understand why everyone’s getting so worked up about this video; how did these people think this stuff was eaten?” Seattle resident Peter Callahan told reporters calling the meat consumption process a brutal but necessary step in the food chain. “Honestly it doesn’t really bother me. Sure it’s not pretty but we as a species have been eating meat that way for thousands of years.”“And I’m not going to stop eating footlong meatball subs just because someone doesn’t like the way it looks” he added.

And if as many expect senior vice president Nancy Byers takes an early retirement in the near future there reportedly will be little stopping Pisciotto from climbing to an executive-level position.Having moved up the company hierarchy so quickly sources confirmed that Pisciotto has even earned the respect of the head of the company.“Mark is a living breathing example of what you can achieve if you’re still employed somewhere when the people immediately above you have moved on” said Forge CEO Donald Snider. “He’s just one of those guys who has what it takes to rise through the ranks partially by default at a company that’s been a revolving door for employees as of late.”“Honestly it takes a special kind of worker to almost inevitably be promoted due to turnover” added Snider. “I could definitely see him in this chair someday especially considering the enticing offers I’ve been receiving from rival firms.”

Further chemical analysis will have to be conducted to determine if the ominous red handprints along the walls were symbolic works rendered in red ochre or simply the result of anguished early humans striking the stone surface until they started to bleed.“What’s remarkable is how with just a few basic pigments and the most primitive painting tools our ancestors could so intensely portray their dread of dying alone or their toxic jealously of alpha males” said Reddy adding that only a highly skilled but extremely alienated artist could use nothing but melted animal fat blown through a hollow bone to convey his dismay at having no one he could consider a close friend and realizing he was too old to make new ones. “It’s clear that these humans felt so disconnected from one another so unable to constructively address their problems that they used these sad disturbing paintings as their sole outlet for comfort.”According to Reddy the paintings not only represent the ability of Late Stone Age humans to express their immediate emotional torment but perhaps also to construct larger more elaborate narratives of their prolonged agonizing downward spirals. Through paint-application analysis and radiocarbon dating methods Reddy said his team was able to determine that individual artists sometimes depicted their unraveling over a series of months or even years.“Here you can see the same figure gorging on bison and growing more and more obese apparently stuck in a lengthy cycle of compulsive overeating” said Reddy adding that the self-destructive pattern was broken only once by an extremely brief sequence of dynamic images suspected to be a quickly abandoned attempt at aerobic activity. “The drawings finally stop after about 20 meters with a half-finished pictograph of what we speculate is the poor man attempting and failing to fit into his deer-hide frock and pants and then out of apparent shame opting not to leave his cave all day.”“Honestly I’m glad the paintings didn’t go on much longer” added Reddy. “Archaeological discovery or not it’s hard to watch a guy like this.”The discovery of the images comes just weeks after archaeologists uncovered a separate set of cave paintings in southern France whose artists reportedly hunted reared children and otherwise did the best they could without taking themselves so goddamn seriously.
2014-04-17T09:30:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/roman-centurion-crawling-out-of-new-york-city-manhole-i-1819576389,Roman Centurion Crawling Out Of New York City Manhole In For One Wacky Adventure,NEW YORK—Standing mystified in a crowded intersection Verus Attius Glabrio a Roman centurion who emerged from a manhole in the middle of New York’s Time Square is in for a wacky adventure sources confirmed Wednesday.Reports stated that Glabrio a highly decorated military officer from 55 A.D. crawled out of the sewer opening at approximately 8:35 p.m. clad in full Roman Imperial battle armor immediately causing motorists to swerve slam on their brakes scream vulgar remarks and make obscene hand gestures in his direction.“Halt yellow beast!” said Glabrio drawing his sword and advancing toward a honking taxi cab that skidded to a stop as angry drivers and stunned passersby urged the Roman centurion to “Get the hell outta the road” and “Go back to Little Italy Julius!” “You shan’t pass this way lest you decide to face me. And let me warn you you great golden demon I’m certainly not a foe you want to face today!”“But lo what is this behemoth?” added Glabrio appearing visibly panicked upon sighting an approaching tractor trailer. “It is the son of Jupiter himself!”After finding his way to the busy sidewalk the centurion who mere moments earlier hit his head against a rock during intense hand-to-hand combat against a rival Corsican general reportedly stared up dumbfounded at the flashing neon lights and video billboards. Sources stated that the Roman soldier then recoiled in fear as stock numbers scrolled across the lighted NASDAQ ticker causing him to raise his shield and cry out “Beware some manner of numeral serpent comes this way!”According to eyewitness accounts the Roman soldier spent the next several minutes asking uncooperative passersby for directions to Corsica stressing that he needed to return to finish the great war and secure victory for the Empire. Despite his best efforts however Glabrio reportedly garnered little attention from anyone aside from a family of tourists who posed for a photo with the baffled Roman infantry commander in front of M&M’s World and an 8-year-old boy who looked up mouth agape from the Spartan-themed comic book he was reading.Several reports indicated that pedestrians gave a wide berth to the sword-wielding Roman centurion and made exasperated remarks such as “Oh great another weirdo” and “Only in New York.”“Will someone—anyone—assist me in my journey?” said Glabrio grabbing at various pedestrians wearing headphones and pushing baby strollers every one of whom shrunk away from him or told him to “buzz off” as they played their brief roles in the soldier’s unpredictable and zany narrative. “Come now citizens of this strange land! I have two denarii for anyone willing to assist me!”“If you cannot accompany me won’t someone at least tell me where I may find this man—surely he must be your leader” Glabrio then added gesturing to a giant billboard ad featuring an image of Puff Daddy.After he was seen very tentatively stepping into a subway train the centurion was reportedly later spotted at the Metropolitan Museum of Art growing wide-eyed upon glimpsing the marble busts of political figures he claimed to know personally while passing through the museum’s Greek and Roman Art exhibit. According to sources Glabrio became involved in a heated altercation with two security guards after he attempted to pick up several of the “clearly looted imperial riches” and vowed to return them to Rome.The situation onlookers told reporters was defused when Rebecca Huntley a meek doctoral student of European history who would unwittingly find her own life turned upside down by this unusual yet strangely attractive man intervened on the Roman centurion’s behalf explaining that he was not from around here and discouraging museum workers from calling the police.“Please my lady surely you can be of service—my men need my aid” said Glabrio talking to the taken-aback but also captivated young woman who according to reports will attempt to help the centurion fit into his new surroundings by dressing him in her ex-fiancé’s undersized tuxedo for an upcoming cocktail party. “If you don’t know the way to Corsica then just usher me to the Imperial Stables where I may find a steed and you can be on your way.”“Wait step back my lady I will protect you!” Glabrio then shouted before leaping and tackling a life-size statue of a lion.The Roman centurion and Huntley reportedly spent the rest of the evening bonding over several slices of pizza a glass of wine Glabrio tossed back in one deep gulp and an awkward but endearing hour of recreational ice skating. Sources confirmed that the night concluded with the pair discussing the breathtaking views of the Adriatic Ocean from the cliffs of Polignano a Mare in Italy where in a coincidental twist of fate the young woman spent time studying abroad and Glabrio was born and raised.At press time sources confirmed that Glabrio was completely clueless to the fact that his rival general from Corsica as well as several of his foe’s underlings were at that very moment beginning to awaken in the middle of Central Park.

Giuliano told the assembled press corps. “If this plan succeeds it will leave behind a nation with a completely dysfunctional economy collapsing infrastructure and a catastrophic health crisis afflicting millions across the nation. We want to emphasize that this danger is very real.”“And unfortunately based on information we have from intelligence assets on the ground this plot is already well under way” he added.A recently declassified CIA report confirmed that all known al-Qaeda-affiliated organizations—from Pakistan to Yemen and from Somalia to Algeria—have been instructed to kick back and enjoy the show as the United States’ federal government energy grid and industrial sector are rendered impotent by internal dissent decay and mismanagement. According to statements made by top-level informants and corroborated by leading Western terrorism experts if seen through to its conclusion al-Qaeda’s current plot could wreak far more damage than the events of 9/11.In the past year money transfers to al-Qaeda cells around the world have reportedly been accompanied by instructions to use the funds to outfit safe houses with the proper equipment to receive American cable news broadcasts and view top U.S. news websites allowing terrorists to fully relish each detail of the impending demise of the last global superpower.Additionally FBI officials made public an internal al-Qaeda video today in which the terrorist organization’s leader Ayman al-Zawahiri chillingly exhorts his followers to “take a load off” and “unwind” in the name of jihad and really cherish the victory over their enemy.“Praise Allah for soon every American city shall be plagued with disaster and hardship” al-Zawahiri said in the video which includes several minutes of footage of young masked al-Qaeda militants casually sipping beverages as they thumb through the latest issues of Time and U.S. News And World Report. “The infidels have brought this pain and destruction upon themselves through their arrogance and callousness. Soon the United States will watch in horror as its bridges crumble its desperate citizens suffer in want of medicine and paying employment and its once vast riches are reduced to naught. The righteous warriors among our ranks must now unite get comfortable and look on from afar at the calamity unfolding in the West.”“We vow that we will not cease sitting around and laughing it up until America is reduced to rubble” he continued.Al-Zawahiri who is seen in the video reclining back in his chair putting his feet up and flipping on CNN later shouts “Allahu Akbar!” when a story is aired about the decade-long trend of stagnant wages among American workers.The FBI has also warned that numerous al-Qaeda agents may have established sleeper cells for the purpose of “getting a kick out of” the nation’s downfall on American soil. The bureau urged U.S. residents to use caution around schools hospitals legislative bodies prisons and other decaying institutions whose imminent failure terrorists may wish to observe up close.Speaking on condition of anonymity one high-ranking U.S. counterterrorism official has described the present situation as a massive failure of intelligence.“The warning signs were there all along but unfortunately we failed to heed them” said the official who advised Americans to brace for widespread devastation. “If we’d listened to experts or even our own common sense we would’ve realized that this plot was being actively orchestrated within our own borders. But we didn’t and now every one of our citizens and our very way of life is at risk from this threat.”“Sadly al-Qaeda has us right where they want us” the official added “and at this point I fear it is too late to do anything about it.”Responding to the allegations a spokesperson for al-Qaeda reportedly confirmed the terror group’s plot and praised the American people as martyrs of the highest order.
2014-04-11T11:52:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/progressive-zoo-houses-animals-in-natural-destroyed-hab-1819576367,Progressive Zoo Houses Animals In Natural Destroyed Habitat,REDDING CA—Long considered among the nation’s premier zoos northern California’s Redding Wildlife Park has continued to earn praise from visitors and industry observers alike for its progressive commitment to housing all of its animals in their natural destroyed habitats sources reported this week.The cutting-edge zoological park which houses some 3000 animals from more than 500 species within its grimy and litter-strewn enclosures reportedly spends tens of millions of dollars each year to maintain a vast variety of polluted and decimated habitats that closely replicate living conditions in the outside world.“Our zoo is dedicated to providing every one of our animals with surroundings that mimic their natural homes as closely as possible which is why we’ve built dozens of modern habitats that contain the precise types of discarded plastic and styrofoam packaging acidified water sources and industrial byproducts they typically encounter in the wild” zoo director Michael LaForge said of the facility’s trailblazing enclosures which occupy more than 100 acres of largely drought-ravaged and eroded land abutting a chemical processing plant. “In the past year alone we’ve spent over $20 million to systematically contaminate dozens of exhibits for our animals from our freshwater pond tainted with hydraulic fracturing runoff to our temperate woodlands that we reduce in size every month through systematic deforestation.”“The rainforest enclosure inhabited by our jaguars and howler monkeys for example is one of the most faithfully reproduced habitats in our park” LaForge said while gesturing to an area of desiccated trees and scorched brown underbrush. “We are 100 percent committed to ensuring that these animals live exactly as they would if they were being constantly harassed and displaced by commercial farmers and loggers in the Amazon Basin.”Employees said that since the first fetid pesticide-laden exhibit was constructed in 2003 trustees have invested large sums of money in researching and developing the most realistic habitats implementing solutions ranging from pumping smog into the air of the Indian elephant pen to introducing devastating invasive species such as cane toads and Burmese pythons into the park’s Caribbean and Everglades habitats. Sources confirmed that the zoo’s state-of-the-art polar bear exhibit features a million-gallon water tank with a single gradually receding platform in the middle while its adjacent sea lion habitat includes a massive patch of floating refuse that includes the latest medical waste and old tires.In each of the exhibits staff said the foul condition of the water and vegetation is closely monitored by dedicated teams of researchers who ensure that the animals remain constantly stressed and malnourished.“One thing we’ll do with our Asiatic cats is deny them sustenance for extended periods of time so they can experience what it’s like to have their natural food source depleted by habitat loss” said zoo official Joe Firer noting that the park currently has all five of its Bengal tigers compete for a small portion of meat that other zoos would normally allot for one of the animals. “When they’re finally too weak to stand we’ll throw in a few pieces of beef for them to viciously fight over just like their cousins in the few remaining natural areas in south Asia that haven’t been fully eradicated by urbanization.”“When you see the sallow hopeless look in their eyes as they spend another fruitless day hunting for food you know you’ve done your job” Firer added. “Ensuring each animal is as miserable as it would be in the wild is our ultimate goal.”Visitors to the wildlife park said that the staff’s commitment to environmental realism is particularly impressive considering the enormous challenge of emulating decades’ worth of ecological destruction with sources noting that employees are constantly working to ensure the zoo’s animals are burdened with accurate levels of fertilizer runoff noise pollution and occasional poaching.After seeing the ailing and distressed animals with their own eyes many visitors reported feeling inspired to support the zoo’s mission.“When I go to Redding I’m always motivated to help out by making a donation of a plastic shopping bag or some old batteries that the staff can dump into the animals’ food and drinking water” patron Joanna Mills told reporters saying that she’s considered volunteering certain weekends to pitch in with the zoo’s simulated oil spills. “And whenever I’m near an outdoor enclosure I always toss an empty water bottle right at the rhinos or the families of orangutans.”“It’s not ideal for them to be taken out of their natural environments so the least we can do is make them feel as threatened and encroached-upon as possible” she added. “Then it’ll feel like home.”
2014-04-10T15:12:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/biologists-confirm-god-evolved-from-chimpanzee-deity-1819576363,Biologists Confirm God Evolved From Chimpanzee Deity,BERKELEY CA—Challenging long-held views on the origins of divinity biologists at the University of California Berkeley presented findings Thursday that confirm God the Almighty Creator of the Universe evolved from an ancient chimpanzee deity.The recently discovered sacred ancestor a divine chimp species scientists have named Pan sanctorum reportedly gave rise over millions of years to the Lord Our God Maker of Heaven and Earth.“Although perhaps not obvious at first glance there are actually overwhelming similarities between the Supreme Being of today and this early primate deity who preceded Him” said Dr. Richard Kamen a leading biologist who also heads Berkeley’s paleotheology department. “The holy chimp moved around on all fours but its descendants eventually began walking upright to expend less energy while foraging across the infinite reaches of the universe. This of course led to the bipedalism of modern-day God.”“In fact you can see a distinct likeness to God in the chimpanzee deity’s skeletal structures not to mention its prototypical expressions of vengeance and wrath” Kamen continued. “The great-ape god was however considerably smaller in stature having not yet developed the capacity to occupy all space and time simultaneously.”According to experts divine life began as a single-celled all-powerful organism roughly 3.6 billion years ago eventually evolving into a multicelled sponge-like deity that bobbed and floated across the chaos of the early universe. Kamen explained that over hundreds of millions of years the godlike life form became more complex with limbs that allowed for locomotion across the endless expanse of the heavens and sophisticated photoreceptor cells capable of seeing all things.Based on newly obtained evidence the Pan sanctorum is thought to have first experimented with creation ex nihilo around 7 million years ago. Kamen noted that the chimpanzee deity made several early attempts to produce rudimentary solar systems but on each occasion was spooked upon inadvertently creating fire which is said to have caused it to screech loudly angrily swat away the newly formed sun and then scamper across the universe to hide from the flaming sphere.“Natural selection played a huge role in the evolution of divinity and in this regard the adaptive value of Pan sanctorum’s immortality proved critical to its survival” said Kamen adding that with its opposable thumbs the divine ancestor was eventually able to fashion primitive tools for creating crude oceans and basic mountain ranges. “Today’s Lord Almighty actually still has a small bony protuberance in the small of His back the vestigial remains of a tail we believe was used by an even older monkey-like god to facilitate climbing allowing it to escape into the heavens when faced with danger.”“That potential for threats made it an evolutionary imperative for the primate god to develop omnipotence” Kamen continued. “As well as sharp claws and pointed incisors.”Though its smaller brain limited its cognitive abilities the chimpanzee deity is believed to have possessed not only self-awareness but also spatial intelligence object permanence and a rudimentary capacity for knowing all that is all that has been and all that ever will be.However it was only relatively recently that the heavenly species developed the intellectual capacity for higher reasoning critical thinking and infinite wisdom according to Kamen. For Pan sanctorum he noted the passage of divine judgment was “purely a matter of primal instinct.”“While complex speech would not emerge until the evolution of the Cro-Magnon god from Pan Sanctorum the chimpanzee deity was capable of using grunts and hand gestures to convey basic emotions such as happiness anger or the forgiveness of sin” Kamen said. “However it appears that the chimp deity often exhibited extremely aggressive behavior in some cases unleashing its divine wrath with little if any provocation toward the mortal chimps it created in its own image.”He added “It is our understanding that these creatures lived in a kind of jungle-like forerunner to the Garden of Eden until a day came when their enraged creator cast them out flinging feces at them as they fled.”
2014-04-09T15:21:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/u-s-surgeon-general-recommends-patching-things-up-with-1819576358,U.S. Surgeon General Recommends Patching Things Up With Father-In-Law,WASHINGTON—Stressing the numerous benefits of letting bygones be bygones acting Surgeon General Boris Lushniak announced at a press conference Wednesday his strong recommendation that U.S. citizens patch things up with their father-in-law.Lushniak the nation’s top public health official stated that it was vitally important for Americans to swallow their pride and make a concerted effort to bury the hatchet addressing the critical need for the U.S. populace to let go of all the resentment and finally move on with their lives and advising that doing so would be best for all parties involved.“After carefully evaluating the evidence we found that the population’s current relationship with their father-in-law is having a serious and negative impact on themselves and the whole family” said Lushniak noting that Americans frequently locking horns with their father-in-law has caused a lot of unneeded stress and made holidays and family gatherings practically unbearable. “Therefore it is the recommendation of the Office of the Surgeon General that you and Kurt wipe the slate clean by implementing the official five-point ‘Put Things In The Past’ initiative.”“He’s going to be in your life no matter what so you might as well make the most of it” Lushniak continued. “Water under the bridge you know?”Lushniak who spent most of the press conference outlining the blueprint for action said that the first step “Starting Off On The Right Foot” would require the American people to pay a one-on-one visit to their father-in-law with a six-pack of Labatt Blue—his favorite beer. The second step “Meeting Halfway” health officials confirmed consists of apologizing for certain things that were said at last year’s Fourth of July barbecue with Lushniak noting that the American people “know exactly what [they] said” at the gathering.The third course of action “Hashing It Out” necessitates that U.S. citizens calmly voice their own frustrations in a considerate way pointing out that even though they might not be making the kind of salary Kurt expects he more than anyone should appreciate the sacrifices that have been made to ensure his daughter is comfortable. The surgeon general explained that the fourth step “Getting Over It” requires each and every American to discontinue fixating on their father-in-law’s previous derogatory comments about their physical appearance and their habit of taking the family car into the shop when by Kurt’s estimate they could perform basic maintenance for a quarter of the cost if they just learned to do it for themselves.Finally the fifth measure for developing a healthy relationship “Biting Your Tongue” recommends that the U.S. populace avoid uttering any defensive hostile or disrespectful remarks particularly about his tightness with money which could potentially get on their father-in-law’s nerves.“To create a healthier nation Americans must commit to changes that promote the putting aside of differences with their father-in-law in order to deal with this ongoing spat head-on” said the surgeon general. “Following the effective strategies of the ‘Put Things In The Past’ proposal assures that the nation lays the groundwork for eventually mending fences with Kurt and maybe even one day getting back to helping him finish the basement like you said you would.”“Of course it is the opinion of this office that the challenge will be daunting especially since both Kurt and the U.S. populace have real short fuses” Lushniak added.The surgeon general cautioned that if the American people and their father-in-law failed to reverse the recent trends and continued to be at each other’s throats then the concurrent epidemics of disrespect and pigheadedness would threaten to further drive a wedge between loved ones. Additionally Lushniak predicted that if the nation didn’t step up and make things right now the next decade would be marked by repeated occurrences of storming out of the room raising voices and making huge scenes in the middle of crowded restaurants.Acknowledging it was unrealistic to expect that the American people would see eye-to-eye with their father-in-law on every issue the surgeon general reminded the 317 million U.S. citizens that they actually had a lot in common with Kurt.“Extensive research shows that Kurt may be set in his ways and tends to get bent out of shape over trivial matters but his intentions are good and it is indisputable that like the U.S. populace he deeply loves and cares for Hannah” said Lushniak adding that the American people and their father-in-law both continue to play very important roles in Hannah’s life. “But it hurts her to see you guys acting this way. If anything why not just make amends so that she’ll be happy?”“And your father-in-law would never admit it but he wants to bury the hatchet on this one too” Lushniak continued. “So what do you say?”At press time the American populace’s father-in-law angrily declared that he had a major bone to pick with the U.S. surgeon general about minding his own goddamn business.

Now at long last all U.S. money has a voice in Washington—a strong loud clear voice that can no longer be suppressed or silenced by anyone.”“This was a long and difficult march and many fortunes were tragically suppressed along the way but finally achieving universal suffrage for money makes all those difficult times completely worth it” continued Mattis. “This is truly a great moment for money across the country.”Mattis explained that the fight for currency’s suffrage in America dates as far back as the nation’s founding noting that while pro-cash advocates faced countless setbacks over the course of history money has always come together in the face of legislative restrictions and judicial rulings to eventually triumph over all legal and political obstacles.According to historians the movement suffered arguably its biggest blow from the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 which stripped many amounts of currency from playing any role in government. However a group of defiant advocates in Washington crusaded for the rights of money and in a major victory for U.S. currency proponents the Supreme Court struck down several FECA provisions in 1976 as unconstitutional beginning a gradual shift that has seen money gain a larger and larger voice in both local and national elections in the years since.According to Mattis such events blazed the trail for the Supreme Court’s watershed Citizens United ruling in 2010 which was at the time the country’s most significant milestone for currency suffrage. Building on the momentum from that ruling Mattis noted that money was able to win over many sympathetic legislators in Congress and fund television and radio ad blitzes that successfully promoted its cause eventually culminating in Wednesday’s decision.For many longtime advocates of currency suffrage who have for years maintained that American cash has been denied a significant enough role in determining the direction the country is headed in and who have bravely stood up in the face of popular sentiment against monetary suffrage yesterday’s ruling was especially satisfying.“After all these years of tireless effort it is deeply validating to see the Supreme Court come to its senses and give all money the freedom to engage in the political process” said 80-year-old business magnate and lifelong currency suffrage proponent Sheldon Adelson. “Frankly this ruling is long overdue. This isn’t the 1800s anymore; you can’t just leave major political decisions to limited groups of money—you have to hear from all of it. Over the decades a lot of stubborn resistant people have tried to rally against expanding the rights of money but at the end of the day those efforts to thwart the progress of money’s role in American government failed. Slowly but surely the strength of cash prevailed. When you have enough cash working together for a single cause no one can silence its voice.”“I couldn’t be happier right now” added Adelson his eyes welling with tears of joy. “You have no idea what this means to me.”Sources noted however that yesterday’s Supreme Court decision only narrowly passed by a vote of 5 to 4 having been pushed through despite vocal opposition from hardened dissenting justices who have long attempted to impede the progress of U.S. currency. However members of the court’s majority took a bold and historic stand in favor of money arguing that universal currency suffrage is an unimpeachable right and that their decision corrects a longstanding historical wrong.“There is no right in American democracy more elementary and fundamental than the right to elect political representatives” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the court’s majority opinion. “Simply put we cannot uphold the U.S. Constitution while continuing to deny and abridge money from full suffrage within all levels of government. All manner of U.S. dollars—from the biggest bank account to the smallest bills—deserve the opportunity to be heard within American democracy as well as the full freedom to promote their political interests.”“And as long as I have a say in the matter” Roberts continued “they will be heard.”

Lane told reporters the overall list includes executives from finance technology energy media and pharmaceuticals stressing that the selected CEOs all have extensive influence in the worlds of business and politics and are each in dire need of a firm smack to the back of the head just as they’re about to sip from a mug of hot coffee.According to Lane there is very little separating the top industrialists on the list all of whom it would be equally satisfying to either uppercut square in the jaw pull in by the tie and clobber in the side of the face with a closed fist or glass paperweight or kick down a flight of stairs and gleefully watch as their $1200 leather briefcase is sent flying wildly into the air.Forbes also highlighted Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein with a special three-page spread arguing that the 59-year-old capitalist is practically begging to be held down on the ground and have his face rubbed in a pile of dog shit while he frantically flails his arms and screams.“We’ve been seeing a continuing trend over the last decade of younger and younger CEOs whom you’d love to just pin down with a knee to the chest grab by the wrists and force to hit themselves in their own face” said Lane noting that 29-year-old Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg jumped seven spots from last year’s list after Forbes editors imagined tying his hands behind his back holding him up by that dumb fucking sweatshirt he always wears and mercilessly pummeling him for 20 minutes straight. “There were a few up-and-coming names who unfortunately didn’t make the cut this time around but don’t be surprised if by this time next year you’re smiling widely at the thought of coldcocking them so hard their eyes get all puffy and stay swollen shut for days.”“Just one free shot that you can put all your weight into” added Lane closing his eyes while slowly following through with an imaginary haymaker. “Right in the fucking face.”Lane confirmed that all 100 CEOs would also be included on Forbes’ forthcoming general list of the world’s Most Punchable People which will be roughly 80000 names long.
2014-04-03T10:30:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/fedex-confirms-more-than-600-000-people-try-to-mail-the-1819576325,FedEx Confirms More Than 600,000 People Try To Mail Themselves Each Year,MEMPHIS TN—Saying that the number has been gradually rising over time officials at global delivery services company FedEx confirmed Thursday that some 600000 people seal themselves up in shipping containers and try to mail themselves every year.A FedEx spokesperson told reporters that in the past year alone the company documented well over half a million incidents in which employees discovered individuals crouched inside oversized cardboard boxes that were either left waiting outside homes or had mysteriously arrived at the doors of FedEx retail locations with completed shipping labels.“Every day we receive dozens of reports from delivery drivers who go to pick up a large package only to suddenly hear someone breathing or rustling around inside” said FedEx director of operations Tim Brankley explaining that most individuals caught mailing themselves are found curled up inside a cardboard box and hidden beneath a layer of packing peanuts. “In most cases we’re able to tell right away when a box contains a person but every once in a while someone will make it all the way onto the truck.”“However the bottom of the box usually isn’t reinforced enough and once it’s lifted the person comes tumbling out in a shower of packing materials” added Brankley. “If they aren’t too stunned after hitting the ground they typically just pick themselves up quickly and run off.”Since the company was founded in 1971 FedEx has reportedly dealt with increasingly elaborate attempts from people looking to mail themselves cross-country with roughly 300000 individuals per year contorting their bodies in cramped containers or shimmying into large cardboard shipping tubes to take advantage of affordable rates on delivery within three to five business days. In addition FedEx workers are also said to annually come across 150000 packages containing people who paint their skin to look like statues and keep perfectly still to avoid detection.Moreover FedEx officials admitted they deal with some 750 misguided individuals each year who do nothing more than affix a mailing label to their bellies and expect to be shipped to their requested destination.With the recent uptick in self-mailing incidents FedEx has reportedly already taken steps to curb the number of attempted human shipments. According to company officials all employees are trained to look more closely for postal boxes that seem to have moved on their own at any point contain two eyeholes cut into the cardboard or emit loud cell phone ringtones.“We warn our employees to be wary of any customer who comes in to a FedEx location asking questions about mailing a package that is 180 pounds and very fragile” said FedEx ground shipping manager Bruce Nichol. “Additionally we’re instructing all of our package center workers to carefully upturn large boxes and then listen for any groans or muffled protests.”“We just want people to know that any attempt to mail yourself is a bad idea—mostly because it’s very dangerous” Nichols continued “even if you wrap your whole body in bubble wrap.”Nichols noted that on average each individual FedEx store has to deal with a handful of individuals attempting to mail themselves every day. Furthermore he said that it is not uncommon for shipping clerks to spot entire families stacked up in separate boxes trying to be mailed together.According to FedEx rules and regulations the company maintains a strict policy of not mailing human beings.“I’ve seen people stuffed into boxes with days’ worth of snacks pillows and portable radios” said Knoxville TN branch manager Carlo Estes. “One time I heard some soft whimpering coming from a box that was supposed to be sent to Honolulu that was just sitting in our sorting facility. And when I opened it I saw a grown man wearing nothing but swim trunks and a pair of sunglasses lying inside totally dehydrated and malnourished.”“Apparently the package wasn’t labeled correctly and couldn’t actually be mailed to its destination” added Estes. “Worst part was seeing the poor guy’s face light up when he thought he had made it to Hawaii.”Despite the company’s expanded efforts to dissuade self-shipping numerous FedEx customers have announced their intention to ignore the rules and continue their endeavors to mail themselves.“They can try to stop me but I have a good feeling about this” said Albany NY resident Seth Holden whispering to reporters from a small air hole carved into the side of a corrugated box. “I’m going to make it all the way this time I can feel it.”“Shh be quiet—I think I hear them coming” he added.
2014-04-02T12:30:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/increasing-number-of-men-pressured-to-accept-realistic-1819576308,Increasing Number Of Men Pressured To Accept Realistic Standards Of Female Beauty,NEW YORK—Confronted on a regular basis with images of women who represent a diverse array of body types a growing number of American men are reportedly feeling pressured to accept the increasingly realistic standards of female beauty now depicted in the media social scientists confirmed this week.“More and more men today find themselves bombarded with un-retouched images and with that comes the considerable mental burden of trying to reconcile what they see in these ads and magazines with their personal perceptions of beauty” said sociologist Cliff Hillard who studies attainable ideals of female attractiveness in the media and how they can create an overly realistic sense of what women ought to look like. “For most men it’s very discouraging. Instead of seeing only rail-thin models they’re now exposed to accurate representations of women whose proportions mimic those of actual human females.”“Think about the average man flipping through a magazine that features pictures of women who haven’t had their cheekbones raised or their noses reshaped with Photoshop” Hillard continued. “How is he supposed to feel when he sees something like that?”Every day according to Hillard men are faced with “inescapable” displays of average-sized women women who are representatively diverse in terms of race and ethnicity and women who are not professional models. According to one recent study the average man sees photographs of women without digitally exaggerated bust-to-waist ratios dozens of times per day on TV billboards and the sides of buses which the findings suggest has a demoralizing effect on the male psyche and has been shown to negatively influence men’s self-esteem and mood the more often they view such images.Hillard noted that major companies like Dove H&M and Ralph Lauren now use nontraditional models in their advertising campaigns an increasingly popular trend that according to the sociologists’ research ultimately serves to make men feel upset and frustrated when the women in commercials don’t live up to their own personal fantasies.“Nowadays I can’t even leave the house without seeing an ad featuring properly proportioned women of statistically normal weights” said San Diego–based civil engineer Spencer DeLane adding that some of the models’ bodies are “startlingly average.” “Sometimes I don’t even want to go online or turn on the television because I know I’ll see a regular healthy-looking woman. Don’t these advertisers understand how deeply depressing that is for me?”“It’s not fair to me and it’s not fair to other men like me” he continued. “Having to live with society’s expectations that I accept women just the way they are takes an enormous toll.”In a recent USA Today poll 87 percent of men said that in the past month they’d seen an ad that made them feel inadequate by challenging their conceptions of physical beauty. Within that group 74 percent said they’d seen a model posing without makeup and 83 said they’d seen visible blemishes with a further 62 percent reporting that they’d seen a model with slight wrinkles around her eyes that “could very easily have been digitally or surgically removed.”Armed with mounting evidence that men can feel crushed under the heavy mental strain to appreciate all types of women Hillard questioned the costs of depicting them in a sensible way that reflects their natural physical variance.“Here you’ve got a generation of boys who will grow up looking at women in the media and seeing flaws here flaws there flaws everywhere—what are they supposed to think?” said Hillard who noted that his 12-year-old son is just now beginning to objectify women and that such portrayals could grossly alter what he perceives as an idealized female form for the rest of his life. “That’s why it’s more important than ever to empower men so they can teach themselves to ignore these ads and images.”“We men simply need to have conviction in our own ideas of what makes a woman beautiful” he added.
2014-04-02T10:11:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/epa-announces-new-initiative-to-conserve-whatever-s-lef-1819576303,EPA Announces New Initiative To Conserve Whatever’s Left,WASHINGTON—In an effort to forestall the nation’s decline in biodiversity and ecological resources representatives from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced an expansive new initiative Wednesday aimed at the conservation of whatever’s left.Speaking at a morning press conference EPA officials told reporters that their new $70 million Save What We Can campaign is directed toward protecting the nation’s remaining plant and animal populations as well as its lakes marshes woodlands and other habitats “insofar as those things are still around.”“By working together with scientists lawmakers and various conservation groups we hope to preserve those ecosystems and forms of wildlife that have actually managed to hang in there for this long” said EPA administrator Gina McCarthy calling for broad-based environmental stewardship to maintain any natural areas that may still contain a handful of species here and there. “Bears flowers tree frogs maybe even a river or two—if they’re still out there we’ll do our best to find and conserve them.”“Basically whichever organisms are living right now we’re going try to keep them alive” she continued. “If that’s still a possibility.”As outlined by McCarthy the EPA will in the coming months award several dozen grants for research projects aimed at locating any biomes that still have enough flora and fauna and untarnished natural resources such that they remain able to function. Additionally the agency affirmed its commitment to deploying its personnel nationwide to do “whatever can be done at this point” to safeguard areas that may still contain clean air clean water and land that’s not completely covered in refuse and filth.Specifically McCarthy said the campaign will seek to rescue the country’s extant “reptiles estuaries some butterflies and who knows maybe some coral reefs hopefully” with the EPA chief noting that such threatened ecological assets could possibly persevere if the agency is able to reach them before they die off for good assuming they’re still in existence in the first place.“There are a lot of ecosystems that are long gone but it should be noted that there are also a few that have somehow managed to make it this far so it’s important for everyone to do their part to help ensure those remaining parts of nature continue to survive” McCarthy said. “For example if you come across any plants in your community or maybe some squirrels or a bird of some kind we ask that you not kill or destroy them. And both individuals and industries should try to avoid putting garbage and chemical runoff into lakes and ponds. You see a few fish could still be living in those waters so doing that might kill them which is actually the opposite of what we’re trying to do. So if everyone could just try to rein in that kind of behavior if you can it would really help us out.”While the EPA’s Save What We Can campaign is significantly less ambitious than previous measures to encourage the environment’s well-being McCarthy admitted such past efforts—including attempts to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions and foster a nationwide switch to clean energy—were “pretty unrealistic” noting that the agency just has to make do with what little resources remain.However McCarthy emphasized that Save What We Can would ultimately have “enormous benefits for a while theoretically” as long as a few still-living things eventually cropped up somewhere.“We’ve come to realize that any measures aimed at restoring the environment to its former health and vitality or those that try to help a dwindling species recover and thrive really aren’t at all feasible for us any longer” McCarthy said. “But through this new initiative we at least have the opportunity to keep the environment going for a little while longer which is better than nothing.”“Of course that’s only until our funding is cut even further” McCarthy added. “Then you know the environment’s pretty much on its own.”
2014-03-31T13:20:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/recovering-alcoholic-doesn-t-need-friends-to-have-a-goo-1819576298,Recovering Alcoholic Doesn’t Need Friends To Have A Good Time,KENTWOOD MI—Two years after making the decision to quit drinking once and for all local man and recovering alcoholic Julian Bradford 35 told reporters Monday he now realizes that he doesn’t need friends to have a good time.“For so long I thought that hanging out with my friends was the only way for me to have any fun but it turns out I can have just as great a time without them” said Bradford who according to sources hasn’t had a drink or a night out with his buddies since 2012. “It was tough at first but now that alcohol’s out of my life I finally understand that I don’t need companionship to keep myself entertained. Now I can have a perfectly enjoyable evening by myself watching TV all without having so much as a single friend.”“The sad thing is I came to rely on being with friends every night and that led me down the wrong path” he continued. “I didn’t see it then—or maybe I just didn’t want to see it—but those pals were terrible for me. And realizing I can live a happy life without them around is the greatest feeling in the world.”A longtime alcoholic Bradford reportedly made the decision to end his dependence on friendship after years of wild nights on the town at which point the local electrical supply salesman ceased drinking and engaging in group activities of any kind. Bradford confirmed that with the help of Alcoholics Anonymous meetings in which he spent an hour every other day sitting in a church basement with a group of complete strangers he was gradually able to wean himself off of his decades-long friendships that had taken a toll on his life and left him devastated.Bradford told reporters he has since come to understand that it’s no longer necessary for him to have a friend by his side at all times to enjoy a baseball game or a movie saying that giving up camaraderie was the best decision he has ever made.“Of course I still think about socializing from time to time but whenever I get tempted to make a phone call to Andy or Dave—even just one little text—I put my phone away and go for a walk alone to settle my mind” Bradford said. “I remind myself that just one night with them is all it would take to bring me back to that old social life I don’t want. And if I hang out with one bud I just know I’d end up hanging out with a bunch and I know exactly where that would lead me.”According to Bradford at his worst he would sometimes see his friends before noon or even meet up with them during his lunch break at work saying that for several years he fraternized every day of the week. Looking back Bradford said he deeply disliked the person he became when he joked around with friends noting that he was often extremely loud and obnoxious and that he’s happy to now enjoy more quiet pursuits like reading and listening to music alone in his one-bedroom apartment.The unmarried man told reporters that he was able to quit friendship “cold turkey” and has not so much as attended a single housewarming party since going clean. Today Bradford who no longer touches beer wine or liquor said he has no regrets about giving up his past life of summer barbecues recreational softball leagues and nights relaxing with friends in his living room.“For a while it seemed like I was spending every single moment partying and screwing around with the guys” said Bradford who noted that he now actively avoids any group outings or social situations in which he may come in contact with his former buddies. “Honestly it got to the point where I couldn’t go a day without spending time with at least one friend; and you’d often find me in my basement kicking back with as many as 10 or 12 of them in one evening. Hell sometimes I’d pass out on the couch surrounded by my buds and then start hanging out with them the second I woke up the next morning.”“I finally realized that if I didn’t stop spending all my time with these people I’d probably end up doing it for the rest of my life” he added.While Bradford asserted that his life is vastly improved now that he has freed himself from his deep-rooted reliance on friendship the nondrinker acknowledged to reporters the importance of remaining disciplined in avoiding the temptations of companionship claiming that as someone who was predisposed to enjoying long crazy nights spent living it up with his friends he continues to be at risk of falling off the wagon and returning to his old habits of being social.“I’ve heard the horror stories about people who think they can handle just one concert or trip to the beach and before you know it they’re back to their former ways spending an entire weekend with their old pals like they used to” the recovering alcoholic said. “But that’s the last thing I want to happen to me.”“And as long as I stay away from booze” he continued “I’m confident I’ll never run into my old friends ever again.”
2014-03-27T14:35:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/american-obesity-epidemic-traced-to-single-heavyset-ma-1819576289,American Obesity Epidemic Traced To Single Heavyset ‘Mayflower’ Passenger,BOSTON—In a startling discovery that sheds new light on the link between the earliest American colonists and their modern descendants researchers at Boston University announced Thursday they have traced the U.S. obesity epidemic back to a single heavyset Mayflower passenger.Through an exhaustive analysis of genetic samples as well as diary entries ship logs and tattered medical records from the early 17th century a multidisciplinary research team has reportedly determined that the majority of severely overweight individuals in the United States today share key genetic markers and unhealthy eating behaviors that appear to be passed down from a 307-pound Plymouth Colony settler named Jeremiah Alden.“At a time when the average European male weighed perhaps 135 pounds Jeremiah’s tremendous size was an exceedingly rare trait which is indicated by contemporary accounts of him as a ‘startling behemoth’ and ‘wide-across as three men together’” biologist Allan Fortner said of the man who by fathering nine portly children is believed to have introduced a predisposition toward slow metabolism and sedentary personal habits into the American genome. “After carefully sequencing the DNA of his remains we have pinpointed this hefty Pilgrim’s appearance in the New World as the single most crucial event giving rise to modern Americans’ elevated BMIs tendency toward overeating and aversion to exercise.”“We would certainly not have a situation in which 62 percent of the U.S. population is either overweight or obese had this man simply stayed in England” he added.Noting that early American colonies were frequently plagued by starvation researchers said Alden’s sheer caloric intake—a 17th-century journal claimed he “consum’d three-and-twenty biscuits every noonday”—allowed the separatist Puritan to thrive despite the odds resulting in a selective genetic advantage. The study’s authors also confirmed that the United States’ high rates of Type 2 diabetes hypertension knee joint pain and sleep apnea are almost solely a result of this one enormous man’s contributions to the gene pool.Researchers said they were first inspired to study Alden after reading several passages in William Bradford’s Of Plymouth Plantation which described the settler as a “slothfull fellow who erupteth through his waistcoat with girth” and “labours hard for his breath the swett allways upon his crimson-hued face.” Though he counted for only one of the Mayflower’s 102 passengers logs kept during the voyage claimed he had “near devowered rations set a-side for one man’s intire voyage” before the ship had even left port in England enraging his gaunt and scurvy-prone fellow travelers.“Upon their arrival in the New World the Pilgrims quickly got to work laying the foundation for a new civilization but it appears Jeremiah just sort of hung out on board for a few days nibbling on salt pork” historian Karen Harmon said. “And once he disembarked he made quick work of the colony’s stores of grain and dried provisions leading to around half the settlers dying in that first winter.”Citing records that indicate Alden required “the skines of seven otters to cloathe wholy his great bodily expance” the research team suggested that his excess reserves of adipose tissue allowed him—and the genes he would pass along—to survive until spring.Numerous artifacts provide further evidence of Alden’s rotundness including a contemporary woodcut that depicts a nearly spherical man the buckles on his doublet straining to contain his frame as he stands among a group of rail-thin Pilgrims and Native Americans. Additional documents also describe first Thanksgiving in 1621 at which according to one account this ancestral forerunner of U.S. obesity “did go back for double treble and quadreble servings” of wildfowl and maize.“Mr. Alden hath the breadth of many men & eats as such w’out nary a mite of shame his wide flesh-ly hands etern’ly imparting morsels unto his happy mouth” reads an entry from the diary of Mayflower captain Christopher Jones. “The savages cry at his immense appearance be-lieving they that he is some terrible monster.”“This morn we went to gather straw fit for thatch and return’d to finde Jeremiah eating merrilee of our common victuals which did anger us plenty” it continues. “Yet he merely shrugged & smiled in a bashfull way in accordance with his gener’ly joyous & agreeible comportment.”The researchers stressed however that their discovery of a single obese progenitor should not be used as a scapegoat by modern Americans for their poor dietary habits and dangerously high body masses.“While this is a significant discovery we must not blame Jeremiah Alden alone for today’s pervasive obesity problem” Fortner said. “He certainly set our nation on the wrong path in terms of excessive weight and unhealthy food choices but we must all take responsibility for our own health. Otherwise we might end up just like Jeremiah who died of a heart attack at age 46 after being accused of witchcraft.”

Huber added that he is “way ahead” of his classmates in terms of planning for his upcoming unemployment noting that many of his peers have not yet even begun to think about how they will struggle and fail to secure a source of income upon leaving college.According to the diligent proactive student he has already arranged to meet with disinterested alumni from his school working in barely relevant fields friends’ parents who hardly know him and career counselors who will probably just direct him toward unpaid internships that after having applied he will frustratingly learn are only open to those still attending college.“I even have a start date—May 12—set for my employment search which means I’ll have to jump right into it without missing a beat” said Huber claiming that his undergraduate years have more than equipped him to handle the 40 hours per week of tedious perusing that his dismal job hunt will require. “Luckily I already have some experience humiliating myself in front of potential employers at college job fairs so I won’t be a complete novice.”“Given the amount of thought and preparation I’ve put into this I definitely feel ready to head out there into the real world and start receiving hundreds of curt dismissive responses from companies telling me no positions are available” he added.Huber remarked that with three or four halfhearted uninformed letters of recommendation under his belt already he believes he has all the false hope he needs to get him through the next couple years. But should he lose interest as the long months go by Huber reported that he won’t be afraid to take a trip back to his college’s career center beg for more help sit through a vapid seminar on how to “nail” an interview and spend the better part of an afternoon idly browsing through job pamphlets and wondering what more he possibly has to do.“And it’s not like I’m going into this punishing nightmare of nonstop employer rejection without a backup plan” Huber said. “If I feel it’s not for me I have plenty of other options. Say I decide I want to pursue an advanced degree solely as a stalling maneuver amid the agonizing and unending search for work and not because I have any interest in the subject whatsoever—that’s still 100 percent on the table. For now though I’m just focusing on pouring myself into the 14-month living hell awaiting me this spring.”“And who knows?” he continued. “I don’t want to speak too soon but it’s definitely something I could see myself sticking with for the next few years or maybe even longer.”

This was an incredibly influential man who deserved all the attention he received. Think of the legacy he leaves behind: In the past three decades homosexuality has become practically nonexistent in society.”“And his record goes on and on” Ammons continued. “Just take a look around today: Nowhere in this country can same-sex partners enter into domestic partnerships file joint tax returns or adopt children. The unmitigated failure of the gay rights movement is something that can be singlehandedly attributed to Fred Phelps and his tireless efforts to show us that this was an unholy behavior.”In addition to his enduring legislative legacy experts agree that Phelps’ religious rallies also had an indelible impact on the American social landscape. Many have pointed to Phelps’ preaching against the sin of homosexuality as the overwhelming reason why all homosexual advocacy groups died out entirely in the early 1990s; why nobody in entertainment politics or professional sports has ever come out as gay or lesbian; and why citizens who do venture out of the closet feel nothing but ridicule and shame knowing they are perversions who don’t deserve to exist.Many historians also noted that Phelps was an outspoken voice on pro-life and pro-marriage matters and that the current zero-percent rates of divorce and abortion in the United States can be entirely attributed to his powerful message.“It’s sickening to think what would have happened to our country if Fred Phelps hadn’t succeeded. Just imagining the sin and depravity that would exist all around us if people went out in public with their same-sex partners or publicly celebrated that perverse aspect of who they are—it’s disgusting and I’m glad that’s not the world we live in” said Seattle resident Christine Smith one of hundreds of millions of Americans who was touched by Phelps’ charisma and was won over by the influential worldview of his Westboro Baptist Church. “But thankfully Fred Phelps opened everyone’s eyes to the truth that homosexuality is a sin that God will vengefully punish and we no longer have to deal with any of those vile people enjoying the same rights as you or me.”“Fred Phelps may be gone but he will long be remembered for the countless accomplishments and successes he achieved in his lifetime” she added. “I can safely say that the name Fred Phelps will never ever be forgotten and that his entire life’s efforts—his very existence—was most certainly not in vain.”

The pair said that Charles with his more sensitive and introspective characteristics would substitute in whenever the social engagement necessitated deeper heart-to-heart discussions about the benefits of drastically lowering personal taxes or repealing environmental regulations.“Right now David is discussing his extensive knowledge of theater with Amber in the Great Hall but in exactly six minutes according to our synchronized watches he’ll say he has to use the restroom at which point we’ll rendezvous I’ll take his eyeglasses from him and jump in to continue the charade” 78-year-old Charles Koch whispered to reporters from a designated stall in the men’s lavatory where his brother would soon arrive and update him about the current developments with Curran. “As long as my brother and I manage not to appear in the same room at once or mention contradictory personal donation figures to Republican Senate candidates we should be able to keep up the ruse without being found out.”“She truly doesn’t suspect a thing!” the industrialist continued. “If everything goes perfectly David might even convince her to come back to our place in our limo while I tag along posing as the chauffeur. I have the uniform ready to go under my tux.”While they confirmed their elaborate ploy is currently proceeding smoothly the vocal free-market advocates acknowledged a number of close calls earlier in the evening. In particular David said he returned to their dinner table not wearing a calla lily that Curran had placed in Charles’ lapel several minutes earlier though after stammering for several seconds David said he was able to slip out of the jam by claiming he had given the flower to the 4-year-old granddaughter of friend and Nova executive producer Paula Apsell who he claimed had taken a liking to it.In another near disastrous moment an error in timing reportedly led the two brothers to calamitously join one another on the dance floor instead of Curran prompting Charles to hastily cut in on a dance between hedge fund magnate George Soros and his wife and waltz off in the opposite direction in order to avoid being seen by their date.“At one point I walked right in on Charles and Amber as they were enjoying a vintage Bordeaux on the veranda forcing me to pick up a nearby tray and masquerade as a waiter so as not to arouse her suspicions” said David Koch while peeking out at his brother and their date through an elaborate floral display. “However after she pointed out to my brother that something about me looked familiar Charles had to resort to drastic measures cunningly diverting her attention by ‘accidentally’ spilling a glass of port onto the chairman of the Cato Institute. We’ve got to be more careful.”“Oh that’s my cue!” the 73-year-old former Libertarian Party vice presidential candidate added spritzing some peppermint breath spray into his mouth. “Charles just said ‘repeal all campaign financing regulations’ which means it’s time for me to step in and seal the deal with a kiss. I’ve always been the one who’s best at making the first move.”According to individuals close to the perennial fixtures atop Forbes magazine’s list of the world’s richest people the Koch brothers’ prank on Curran is not the first time they have conspired to deceive an unsuspecting mark. At an event last December held to support the anti-Obamacare foundation Americans For Prosperity sources confirmed that the brothers successfully perpetrated a similar ruse—with one always hiding and listening in from underneath the lavish banquet table prepared to switch places at a moment’s notice—in order to seduce South Carolina governor Nikki Haley.Additionally the two narrowly pulled off an even more elaborate stunt at a $50000-per-plate dinner to benefit the 2012 presidential run of Mitt Romney reportedly utilizing a pair of wigs and elevated platform shoes to impersonate their absent brothers Frederick and Bill thereby skirting federal limits on individual political contributions.However at the Metropolitan Museum event onlookers confirmed that the brothers’ reckless scheme often seemed precariously close to spinning out of control.“You fool! If you don’t get your act together we’re at risk of capsizing the whole enterprise!” Charles shouted at his brother after they absentmindedly ran headlong into one another in the building’s grand atrium. “Now what are—oh wait she’s here get down! Get down!”At press time Curran’s unexpected appearance had forced Charles to quickly shove his brother into a nearby fountain before escorting his increasingly skeptical date out of the room to meet Rupert Murdoch.

More than one could ever possibly take.” If legends are to be believed the teachers in every classroom in the district hold an advanced degree often a doctorate and the day’s lessons are displayed on Smart Boards synced to each student’s school-issued iPad.It has even been prophesied that there are unlimited opportunities to participate in extracurricular activities—from advanced computer programming clubs to organized weekly community service projects—that look good on a scholarship application.“There are some who believe the perfect school district does not exist—that it is just an old tale handed down in whispered tones at PTA meetings and Kaplan Test Prep centers and nothing more” said Ken Linden resolutely staring off into the distance. “But we know it is out there somewhere and we believe its manifold rewards will be visited upon the children of those able to secure an open spot. Many have faltered in this quest but we will succeed. We must succeed.”“When I close my eyes I can almost envision the quiz bowl team prepping for regional finals” he added.Fleeing as they are a blighted elementary school district that does not feed into their town’s good high school the Lindens told reporters they know well the risks their mission entails. The couple said that a year ago they were convinced they had discovered the mythic realm in Barterfeld VA but their hopes were cruelly dashed when they read about a 2011 bullying incident at one of its schools forcing them to begin the daunting quest anew.They confirmed the same fate befell them last fall when they believed Rundlett County Public Schools to be the storied district of legend only to find out later that its senior-year internship programs were insufficiently rigorous and that its reputation for math while good could be better.“Each time we thought we had finally found this long-foretold-of scholastic paradise it turned out to be no more than a mirage” Deborah Linden said. “I know our journey may seem misguided even mad to some but these legendary places of learning where one-on-one counseling and tutoring are available from pre-K onward promise far too much for us to let them slip from our grasp.”“’Cause there’s no way we’re letting our kids go to Richmond South” she added. “That dump doesn’t even have an HD video production studio.”

You can say pretty much anything around her.”“The thing is I’m not that great at talking to women but with Sarah it’s not like that” McKean continued. “She’s not dramatic; you don’t have to walk around on eggshells with her. Sarah never gets mad about stupid little things. She’s definitely one of the gang.”Valetta who frequently spends time with the group of friends at their apartments or at local dive bars and aches deeply for romantic affection is widely regarded by her male companions as “the coolest girl” they have ever met. In addition the marketing associate who is preoccupied with fears that she is invisible to men is reportedly more fun to be around than any other woman according to the men interviewed.“You don’t have to be on guard around her” said coworker and friend Ted Reiner 26 a man to whom Valetta gives “awesome” dating advice and whom she has specifically styled her hair and clothes to please and hopefully arouse. “I don’t have to worry about what I say to her. I’m never trying to impress her or anything. Plus she’s not high-maintenance at all. And she’s not crazy or clingy or anything.”“She’s just fits right in with the rest of us” Reiner added. “A lot of the time we’re having so much fun laughing and joking openly with each other about women or sex that we forget she’s even a girl. She’s that cool.”Emphasizing his appreciation for Valetta’s spontaneity bawdy sense of humor and love of action movies—all attributes that his own girlfriend does not possess—Reiner said that the tautly wound ball of sexual yearning is a cherished member of his friend group.The undersexed woman who reportedly feels an agonizing mixture of longing and despair whenever she spends time with her male friends told reporters that she is lucky to have them.“Those guys are the best” said Valetta whose acute hidden craving for sexual contact is ever present and permeates nearly every one of her thoughts. “They’re such a blast. I’m always going over to one of their places to watch TV order some food [get so sexually distracted that I can barely focus on anything but my own carnal starvation and then as soon as I get home descend into debilitating worries that I’ll always be this terribly unfathomably alone]. We have a lot of fun.”“Plus it’s just a load off to have friends who I can be totally myself around” Valetta added.

Those are both options we are currently considering” Rahman added. “Everything’s on the table. That is insofar as anything exists at all which we’re also looking into.”Rahman assured the press and families of passengers that officials would not rest until they locate the plane provided that sensory experience can be verified beyond the existence of one’s own mind. Malaysian authorities also cautioned that they were dealing with an unprecedented aviation mystery and that it could take months to ascertain the airliner’s exact fate as well as for that matter the fate of mankind itself assuming a linear theory of space-time in which the future is unknowable and objects travel in a forward trajectory which authorities hasten to add is not necessarily the case.In addition airline sources attempted to assuage an uneasy public by noting they had brought in top crash investigators from the Malaysian Vietnamese and Chinese governments as well as U.S. Navy personnel Boeing technicians leading quantum physicists theoretical cosmologists metaphysicians epistemologists and determinist philosophers to help scour all conceivable and as yet inconceivable locations in which the plane might be located.“The bottom line is that we have a sophisticated aircraft fresh off a safety inspection with no prior incident of malfunction flying in good weather at a cruising altitude” Rahman continued. “Why didn’t the pilot send a distress signal? Why aren’t we finding a debris path? What are we to make of the contradictory radar information? Where did the universe begin and can it be said to have a limit or an edge? What is mankind’s role in it? Is there a God? If so what is God’s nature?”“It’s too early to answer these questions right now but I can assure you that Malaysia Airlines will get to the bottom of it” Rahman added. “Our top people are on it right now.”
2014-03-12T11:49:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/obama-spends-afternoon-in-garage-restoring-classic-dron-1819576245,Obama Spends Afternoon In Garage Restoring Classic Drone,WASHINGTON—Taking his time to thoroughly clean a pair of replacement carburetors and install them on a turbocharged Rotax engine as classic rock tracks blared from a nearby transistor radio sources confirmed that President Barack Obama spent most of Wednesday afternoon in the White House garage continuing his restoration of a vintage military drone.Pausing every so often to admire his work the president dressed in jeans and a grease-stained Champion sweatshirt explained that he has been tinkering with the 1995 RQ-1 Predator since acquiring it from a military scrapyard two years ago. The commander-in-chief said he considers the salvaged unmanned aerial vehicle a prized find as the United States only produced 12 of the classic airframes for their inaugural deployment in the Bosnian War.“Now this baby right here is 1300 pounds of pure American muscle” Obama said as he tossed a socket wrench aside and wiped the oil from his hands. “From the single rudder steering to the inverted V-tail at the back it’s all classic General Atomics engineering. Real beaut isn’t she?”“I mean look at this pretty little antenna dome” he continued buffing the drone’s satellite communication housing with a shammy cloth. “They just don’t make UAVs like this anymore.”After popping the cap off of a fresh Rolling Rock the 44th president of the United States explained that in an effort to maintain its mid-’90s authenticity he is rebuilding the craft using mostly original RQ-1 parts ordered either directly from the manufacturer or traded with other collectors online. The head of state added that he has come to prefer the latter saying that it provides him an opportunity to meet and talk shop with fellow “drone-heads.”“When I’m done she’s gonna have all the bells and whistles of the original; I’m talking Moving Target Indicator APX-100 Friend-Or-Foe transponder heat sensor laser designator—the whole enchilada” Obama said standing next to a faded poster from the 1994 Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. “And if I can pick one up on the cheap I’m hoping to put in a top-of-the-line GPS too.”“With a set of souped-up avionics like that you can really open her up once you hit international airspace” he continued.The president who confirmed that he planned on sanding down the tail the next time he has a free weekend said that after installing custom titanium wing linings his next project will be to apply a coat of gunmetal gray paint to the vehicle’s body in order to get “that timeless Predator look.”Obama later mentioned however that he hasn’t completely ruled out one day upgrading the paint job to pure white or even MARPAT desert camouflage which he claimed would “turn a few heads” and make the shell’s classified carbon-Kevlar composite “really pop.”“Of course some of these mods aren’t exactly regulation” the sitting president said with a wink referring to the set of AGM 114-Hellfire missiles his friend a retired Air Force weapons specialist he would only identify as “Spud” helped him install last fall. “I also stripped off her Synthetic Aperture Radar to compensate for the added weight which just means you have to be a little more careful when the weather’s bad.”“These old Predators are highly temperamental so you’ve got to know how to treat ’em right” he continued adding that he wouldn’t dream of running one with anything less than a 50-50 blend of JP-8 and Syntroleum jet fuel. “Normally people can only get these things to do about 135 at a max altitude of 25000 feet but with a little TLC I’ll bet I can juice her up to at least a buck fifty-five buck sixty.”Obama boasted that the finished work would harken back to the “glory days” of drones when he says American ingenuity dominated the skies over the Balkans. Noting that back in that era Predators were the drone of choice for Operation Nomad Vigil the nation’s chief executive reflected on the machines’ superior handling and reconnaissance capabilities lamenting that today’s newer models with their “flashy AN/AAS-52 Multi-Spectral Targeting Systems” seem only to be focused on precision strikes against high-value terrorist targets.The two-term president told reporters he does not intend on selling the drone once it is finished acknowledging that in addition to its sentimental value he likes the idea of taking it out for a spin on the occasional Sunday morning or showing it off to some of his older NATO buddies who remember the vintage UAVs from back in their earlier peacekeeping days.“Michelle sometimes tells me I’m spending too much time and money on this thing” Obama said. “But I’ve told her that this has always been my passion that this is what I love to do. At the end of each day all I’m thinking about is getting in this garage sliding onto my mechanic’s dolly and getting to work bringing this baby back to deployment condition.”“What can I say?” the president added. “I just really connect with these machines.”According to sources after testing and recalibrating the propeller the president spent another hour cleaning up the scraps of metal and foam shavings from his worksite. Observers say Obama then stood in the doorway staring reverently at the drone for several moments before turning off the light and slowly heading inside.

In addition she said no boyfriend will again allow himself to be as vulnerable around you—like Brian did when he bought you two pink carnations on Valentine’s Day or the time he let you see him cry after his grandmother died.The report also found that no other guy will ever be as understanding as Brian was citing the time he took you to see Jurassic Park bought you a box of Mike and Ikes and reached for your hand to comfort you during the scary parts.Cheung went on to affirm that behind the edginess that made your parents uncomfortable Brian was really sweet and had hazel eyes that you could stare into for hours.“The man you’re currently interested in to take but one example will never measure up to the boy who wrote heartfelt love notes and slipped them into your locker for you to find later” Cheung said. “This new guy may have a lot going for him but here’s what he doesn’t have: a Sony Discman containing the Dead Kennedys’ Frankenchrist that the two of you can cut class and listen to. Brian had that.”“Face it this is a pattern you will continue to experience for the rest of your life always hoping for someone as wonderful as your eighth-grade boyfriend but always coming up short” she continued. “No one will ever compare to him and you will never feel as special as you did in his cool basement. This is a fact.”According to the report while Brian long ago moved on with his life there are still times when he looks back fondly on his youth and secretly pines for his first true love the girlfriend he had in tenth grade.
2014-03-10T12:55:00-05:00,https://www.theonion.com/company-president-started-out-as-fertilized-embryo-1819576235,Company President Started Out As Fertilized Embryo,NEW YORK—Marveling at just how far he had come in 56 years MerCal Enterprises president David Gilford reflected this week on his rise from a humble fertilized embryo to head of a publicly traded multinational company.Speaking from his executive suite Gilford told reporters that as leader of a business that regularly reports billions in profits his current station in life is a far cry from his beginnings as a newly formed zygote when he didn’t have single dollar or functioning circulatory system to his name.“It wasn’t easy at the beginning just grinding it out for nine long months” said Gilford noting that immediately following conception he was guided by little more than the cilia that pushed him down the fallopian tube having never even seen a quarterly report or attended a shareholders meeting. “Back then I didn’t know which way was up. I was struggling just to work my way toward the womb.”“But here I am now an hour away from signing off on the largest acquisition in this company’s history” he continued. “I sure didn’t realize it back then but when that sperm cell fused with that ovum and endowed me with two sets of chromosomes it set me on the path to the corner office I’m in now.”Gilford said he never even entertained the possibility that the differentiated tissue groups he began to form after attaching to the uterine wall would one day lead to him overseeing more than 7000 employees in 11 global offices. While it now seems obvious that the placental nutrients he was receiving from his mother have been pivotal in his appearing year after year on Forbes’ list of the nation’s highest-paid chief executives Gilford admitted that at the time he didn’t stand out as anything special.“I don’t think I screamed ‘future CEO’ when people looked at me back in those days” said Gilford who as a blastula had only begun developing new non-maternal mRNA. “What did I know about negotiating or leveraging? I knew how to fill my central cavity with fluid. That’s what I could do so I did it.”“I probably seemed like just another neural groove with a brain bulge” he added. “But you can’t climb that ladder without the bottom rung.”By day 105 however rudimentary air sacs had begun to develop in the future magnate’s lungs and his nervous system had gained control over multiple bodily functions events that Gilford said were “absolutely crucial” in his acceptance into the prestigious Wharton School and later joining Morgan Stanley as a finance analyst immediately upon graduation.But while he received a compensation package last year of more than $16 million including cash and stock options in no small part due to the cartilage muscle and bone structures that developed from his mesoderm Gilford admitted it was not smooth sailing all the way. At week 11 his eyelids suddenly closed for nearly two months a discouraging setback that Gilford said ultimately helped almost as much as everything that went right.“When I think about it what I went through in those first trimesters helped make me the business leader I am today” he said speculating that those 38 long weeks instilled in him a sense of patience and the essential cardiovascular functions needed to make his way in the cutthroat business world. “One of the most important things in this profession is adapting to changing conditions and I’m a guy who successfully transitioned out of living in a liquid-based environment to breathing oxygen. And I did it entirely on my own.”Most important to his success according to Gilford has been never taking his good fortune for granted and appreciating how much he has progressed from his simple early days plodding through organogenesis sexual differentiation and limb development.“Look I started out with nothing more than a single cell” said Gilford who makes a point of frequently reminding himself of all those weeks he had to scrape by on whatever was delivered to him through his umbilical cord. “And then I managed to double it double that again and then double that again. At this point I think I’m estimated to have about 100 trillion of them.”“Not bad for a kid who was briefly in breech presentation” he added.The multimillionaire acknowledged that despite his own hard work he did not make it to his current position entirely on his own. According to Gilford he’d never have an apartment on Park Avenue or a 75-foot yacht had his mother not paid attention to her diet and behavior during pregnancy or received such expert care from her obstetrician both of which Gilford said kept him going when fetal viability seemed a million miles away.And despite his eight-figure salary Gilford told reporters he has yet to succumb to the trappings of his high status and hasn’t forgotten the days when he was covered in a thin layer of lanugo.“A lot of people think I’ve changed as a person since fertilization and in some ways maybe I have” he said reflecting on his increased attention to profit margins as well as his ability to grasp objects. “But don’t let the hand-tailored suits and my completely fused skull fool you.”“Deep down I’m still that same pair of gametes” he added.
2014-03-07T09:57:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/national-endowment-for-the-arts-provides-80-million-to-1819576234,National Endowment For The Arts Provides $80 Million To Discourage Talentless Hacks,WASHINGTON—Continuing in its mission to support excellence across a range of artistic disciplines the National Endowment for the Arts announced Friday a new initiative allocating $80 million to discourage no-talent hacks from engaging in creative endeavors.The independent federal agency said it intends to provide the nation’s exceptionally unskilled and deluded artists with cash grants ranging from $10000 to $25000 in order to sway them from continuing with their derivative and atrocious work thereby significantly bolstering the overall quality of art in the United States.“In order to promote a flourishing artistic climate we must use our resources to ensure that those individuals with the least talent stay away from the arts” NEA acting chairperson Joan Shigekawa told reporters at a press conference flanked by existing pieces of insufferably trite art including various examples of black-and-white photography and scrap-metal sculpture. “Providing the nation’s inept amateurs with the funding they need to pursue hobbies and professions unrelated to fine arts will revitalize this country’s creative output furthering our goal of promoting works that aren’t a complete embarrassment.”“The vitality and vibrancy of the American cultural landscape hinges on helping these clueless individuals realize their lack of potential” she continued.According to Shigekawa the NEA is actively seeking out deserving grant recipients whose absence from the artistic community will drastically enhance it including incompetent aspirants in the fields of collage interpretive dance and found poetry. While the organization is urging hopeless awful artists to apply for its quarterly disbursements and fellowship programs it is reportedly also calling on the directors of the nation’s printmaking workshops alternative theatre troupes pottery studios and creative writing circles to nominate their most unpromising hacks.The NEA claimed that those candidates who are unable to demonstrate an ability to create work that is not insultingly abominable will receive financial endowments enabling them to make a lasting positive impact on the nation’s overall arts scene by abandoning their creative aspirations altogether.Shigekawa noted that these awards would also include extended residencies in various office jobs in which these talentless individuals can fully commit their energies to not producing what they consider art.“We’re looking for a lack of aptitude but also a specific type of unfounded confidence that if properly stymied will allow the arts in this country to thrive for years to come” Shigekawa said adding that the NEA has already reached out to numerous disgraces who specialize in the areas of street art and documentary filmmaking. “The chapbook self-publishers the musique concrète composers the performance artists—with these grants we can give these people the support they need to stop what they’re doing right now.”“The future of art depends on it” she continued noting that her organization is also immediately establishing a program to provide $100000 major grants to impede the work of oblivious novices who attempt to imbue their work with any kind of political statement.According to agency sources the NEA has already begun considering thousands of lousy pretentious grant applicants having recently named its first award recipient: Austin TX mixed media artist Edith Watt who told reporters she is excited to have the opportunity to finally contribute something meaningful to the art world.“After years of toiling fruitlessly I feel like I’m finally earning the art community’s respect” said Watt 24 who through the NEA’s endowment program has been given a generous weekly stipend that she stands to forfeit in the event she is caught resuming work on her insipid banal compositions. “This grant has helped me realize the things that I’m incapable of and it has allowed me to achieve the dream that so many others have had for me since I first started out as an artist.”“If only more artists could have this opportunity” Watt added.

Hang it all the way down the main thoroughfare and unfurl the Imperial banner from every spire. And don’t forget the silken tricolor pennons as well. We must spare nothing for the Inspector! If he finds the town in its current state he will be most aggravated.”“Oh if only someone had warned us he was coming today” he added dabbing sweat from his brow while checking his silver pocket watch. “My goodness! Look at the hour!”According to numerous uneasy sources the Imperial Inspector known throughout the Northern districts as a severe man not given to humor is at this very moment speeding here from the heart of the dominion in his personal steam coach leaving precious little time to patch up the dilapidated clock tower and polish the welcoming bells.Additionally incoming reports indicate that the Inspector will be accompanied by his formidable Imperial Convoy including the Grand Minister the Builder and if rumor is to be believed even the mysterious Captain of the Dragoons.“Tokens everyone! Gather your tokens to present to the Inspector!” said the Tokenmaster as the frenzied citizenry clambered to retrieve their glistening golden ingots embossed with the crest of the local district. “And where are the buglers? They have practiced the Magisterial Tribute March have they not? Remember that a single misplayed note will displease the Inspector and we all know exactly what will happen then.”“Now listen close: After we all deliver our ovations we must make sure that the children stifle their pennywhistles—there must be total silence as the Inspector delivers his speech in praise of the Empire and her armada” the Tokenmaster continued adding that these recitations shall be met with rousing applause followed by a spirited rendition of the Sovereign Anthem.With mere minutes left before the Imperial coach enters the tram station sources are emphasizing that all must be careful to keep the Inspector in good spirits limiting topics of discussion to his hunting trips his young bride and the monarchy’s recent conquests in the provinces. Most crucially sources stated that the townsfolk must take great pains to avoid any mention whatsoever of the Chancellor with whom the Inspector has long quarreled.Furthermore the Sergeant-at-Arms has reportedly instructed the town’s couriers to venture far and wide to gather provisions for the most lavish feast the region has ever seen emphasizing that no expense shall be spared.“Pheasant stew. Mutton. And there will be plum pie and jellies for the children” the Sergeant-at-Arms said as an army of townspeople draped a canvas over an unsightly crack in the Banquet Gallery wainscoting that there is simply no time to properly dispense with. “And we must have brandywine! Find the storekeeper and have him bring forth a hogshead of the ’28 golden vintage posthaste.”“All gone? Do we still have the ’31? It will have to do” he added. “Oh we must hope that the Inspector does not notice or all is lost!”Noting that the forsythia are in bloom anxious sources additionally insisted that all the town’s girls hurry down to the grove and assemble garlands for the evening’s spectacles wherein they will perform the courante for the Inspector—smiling always smiling of course!“All must attend the festivities” said the Vice Elder stressing that the displays of horsemanship and cannonry must be executed admirably with no mistakes. “Even my dear uncle with his ailing leg must be roused. He must be brought out for the whole town must be seen and assayed by the vigilant eye of the Imperial Inspector himself!”“And we must—wait what is that whistle?” he continued. “My heavens he’s already here!”At press time a tense hush had fallen over the townsfolk after scrambling into formation in the main square with every resident holding themselves stiffly upright and forcing broad smiles across their faces as the Inspector’s dusky rail carriage came to a grinding stop.

And with every single baby boomer eventually needing to be transported to a morgue autopsied and properly discarded we’ll see unemployment drop to near record lows.”“In short the unprecedented baby boom that followed World War II is about to provide us with an equally valuable corpse boom” he added. “And that’s welcome news for the average American’s wallet.”Forecasts suggest that the expansion in mortuary services will be akin to the growth of tech startups in recent decades and that coastal Florida is well positioned to become an industrial hub on par with Silicon Valley likely serving as the chief headquarters for major Fortune 500 body bag manufacturers and headstone companies. Already profit-minded speculators are reportedly driving up land prices to record levels in Fort Lauderdale where thousands of condominiums will need to be razed to make room for enough cemetery plots for millions of soon-to-be dead baby boomers.According to the report today’s younger generations are set to enjoy marked increases in economic opportunity and annual income as their parents and grandparents die off. Hundreds of billions of dollars are set to be infused into local economies experts stated as a wave of prosperity flows across the country from sympathy card producers to candlemakers all the way down to manufacturers of easels that hold large portraits at memorial services.The report also affirmed that the entire U.S. economy must recalibrate to meet the challenges of the death-industry-based economy of tomorrow. In particular the report’s authors noted that chemical companies will need to repurpose their facilities to generate the 200 million gallons of embalming fluid baby boomers are expected to absorb by 2035 while the engraving industry would have to add an estimated 4 million workers to ensure the required amount of granite grave markers are properly buffed and inscribed with the names and death dates of the deceased masses.Additionally economists stated that ailing U.S. automakers would see a huge boost in business with the Big Three car manufacturers reactivating dozens of long-idled plants to keep pace with the explosion in demand for hearses.“Investors should definitely keep an eye on crematory futures­—that’s where the smart money is” said market analyst Margaret Hughes who predicted that facilities for the incineration of human remains will soon be on every block in urban shopping districts. “And young people would be well advised to pursue careers as coroners or undertakers. When baby boomers depart they’re going to leave behind an entire generation of mortician millionaires.”“Frankly anyone who knows a thing or two about floral arrangements will be vaulted into the upper class in this new economy” she added.Explaining that the sooner they die the sooner the “golden age of economic prosperity” will arrive the report pointed to encouraging data on baby boomers’ high rates of cardiovascular disease Type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer’s all of which are expected to help accelerate economic growth to levels unseen since the digital revolution.While many observers have said the new era of affluence can’t arrive fast enough others remain more cautious asking what will happen a few decades from now when most of the boomers have been buried and the so-called casket towns expected to pop up all across the country see their single source of revenue dry up.“Sure it’ll be a huge windfall at first whether you’re churning out coffins dark-colored suits floral wreaths statues of grieving angels tiny American flags or those black pillbox hats with netted veils” said James Keeley 37 a small business owner in Cleveland. “But after my parents die and all their friends die and we complete the monumental task of getting rid of all the bodies and ashes what happens then?”“As much of an economic boon as the baby boomers’ deaths will be we can’t depend on their dead bodies always being there for us” he added. “If we’re prudent we should already start preparing for a future without their mortal remains.”
2014-02-27T15:29:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/modern-science-still-only-able-to-predict-one-upcoming-1819576199,Modern Science Still Only Able To Predict One Upcoming Tetris Block,CAMBRIDGE MA—During a press conference Thursday at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology leading members of the scientific community confirmed that despite decades of research the best available theoretical models still cannot predict more than one upcoming Tetris block.While they have long possessed the technology to accurately forecast and display which of the seven distinct Tetris shapes or tetrominoes will appear next scientists told reporters they’ve so far had no success determining what any of the blocks beyond the immediate successor will be.“Modern supercomputers have now reached speeds of 30 quadrillion calculations per second but even with all that processing power we’re no closer to solving this problem than we were a generation ago” said MIT professor Michael Haemlin who has studied tetromino sequencing since 1984. “Right now our most sophisticated equations can correctly predict two upcoming blocks just one out of every seven times which unfortunately is no better than the result achieved by random guessing.”“So for years all we’ve been able to do is rotate each descending shape 90 degrees at a time control its lateral movement accelerate the speed of its descent if desired and simply hope for the best” Haemlin added.According to researchers the ability to predict two three or four incoming shapes would be “nothing short of revolutionary” allowing blocks to be stacked in more optimal patterns in order to achieve the goal of eliminating horizontal lines as efficiently as possible.For example with enough advanced warning of an arriving I-shaped piece scientists said they could in theory prepare the Tetris matrix in such a way that up to four rows are cleared simultaneously with many stating this was one of the ultimate goals of their rigorous stacking trials.“Over the past 30 years we’ve developed a much better understanding of how blocks fit together” said Dr. Florence Edelman the designer of a well-known Tetris experiment in 1993 in which a perfect slot for an L or zigzag block was created under carefully controlled conditions only to be closed off when a series of ill-fitting square pieces appeared instead. “But without a working predictive model our entire field of study is at an impasse. Indeed reaching unpassable standstills is well chronicled in trial after trial.”“Some of the world’s most brilliant scientific minds have dedicated their lives to unlocking this mystery yet for all their knowledge and expertise it’s still anyone’s guess what will happen five or 10 seconds into the future” Edelman continued. “Once that last bit of uncertainty has been eliminated we believe our interactions within the Tetris matrix will be far more successful.”Edelman stated that many aspects of Tetris are indeed predictable noting that workers in her lab had discovered that each falling piece is consistently composed of four individual tiles; that the speed at which descents occur increase in direct proportion to total time elapsed; that pieces with the same shape also share the same color; and that while the color of a piece is not particularly important its shape is of vital significance.Foreknowledge of those shapes she explained could lead to a breakthrough phenomenon she described as “a perpetual Tetris” of unlimited duration.“While this remains entirely hypothetical at this moment there exists a theoretical point at which the elimination of bottom rows occurs with such speed and efficiency that there is always enough room at the top of the matrix to accommodate new pieces” Edelman said. “This would create a fluid and sustainable Tetris that could exist indefinitely—perhaps forever. It would of course still require continuous human maintenance but it would be a monumental step in the right direction.”“For now though” she added. “We’ll simply keep trying and see how far we are able to progress.”

You can counter every single one of his arguments with irrefutable Scripture all day but you’re not getting through. Even when I try to tell him these aren’t just my personal beliefs but the consensus opinion of leading pastors and radio personalities he’s still not convinced.”“Honestly I think he’s afraid” added Byers. “Maybe if he opened his mind a tiny tiny crack he just might discover that it’s Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve.”Many speculated that Dunham’s obstinate behavior stemmed from an insular childhood spent cloistered exclusively among similarly close-minded individuals. Under these sheltered conditions acquaintances told reporters it might actually seem natural for him to doubt that gays and lesbians serve the Devil that they are intent on converting all young children to homosexuality or that their sexual orientation is actually a disease.As a result some said they tried viewing Dunham’s refusal to acknowledge even the most common-sense facts about homosexuality’s apocalyptic power with understanding and compassion.“I just try to remind myself that Kyle’s not inherently a bad person just an ignorant one” said coworker Cathy Ramirez who conceded that she occasionally walked away from a conversation with Dunham rather than listen to him repeat the same tired egalitarian talking points over and over. “If I was raised in an environment where I had no choice but to read something other than the Old and New Testament I might share his same stubborn beliefs.”But most who have come up against Dunham’s intractability told reporters that their sympathy quickly gives way to frustration.“I just get so angry when I sit there citing clear-cut evidence like Leviticus 18:22 Romans 1:27 and Corinthians 6:9 and I can already tell his mind’s 100 percent made up” said Dunham’s former college roommate Nate Dietrich admitting he often rolls his eyes at the forwarded emails he receives from Dunham that make impassioned claims about homosexuality being a normal natural behavior. “He’s just so trapped in his little sealed-off world that nothing makes a difference nothing. I just want to shake him you know?”“One of these days though he’s going to have to leave that dark cave of his and accept that being homosexual is an offense in the eyes of God and will incur His righteous wrath” Dietrich added. “Honestly I don’t know how you go through your whole life living in blindness like that.”
2014-02-21T13:33:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/german-leaders-quietly-confident-they-could-pull-off-an-1819576181,German Leaders Quietly Confident They Could Pull Off Another Holocaust If They Ever Really Wanted,BERLIN—Though emphasizing there is zero possibility such plans will be carried out now or any time in the future as easy as it would be to implement them German officials quietly admitted this week that they could probably pull off another Holocaust if they really wanted to.Calling the systematic elimination of millions of individuals “a huge undertaking though certainly quite doable” both liberal and conservative members of Germany’s legislature privately conceded that if push came to shove they definitely have the infrastructure technology and manpower required to once again round up Jews Poles gays and other targeted minority groups transport them to concentration and forced-work camps and execute them en masse.“Now I’m not saying that this is something anyone would like to do but if the German government decided it wanted to carry out another Holocaust we definitely have the ability” said Bavarian representative Kaspar Harriger of the political consensus among all 631 elected members of the Bundestag who unanimously agreed that the tools needed to undertake another genocide are “pretty much ready to go” if they want them. “Do we currently have plans to annihilate two-thirds of the Jewish population? No. Does every member of the government believe the Holocaust was a crime against humanity that should never be repeated? Of course.”“But could we in fact sponsor and carry out the ethnic cleansing of millions of people to create a society fitting a eugenic ideal? Sure” he continued. “We aren’t going to and we don’t want to but we could. No doubt about that.”Members of the federal government agreed that though they have no intention whatsoever of creating a master Aryan race by purging the general populace of those deemed to be genetically inferior they have everything in place to “get [a second Holocaust] going” relatively quickly if they felt like it. Additionally German lawmakers stated that such a mass genocide would be far faster and more efficient than in the past highlighting in particular the country’s advanced high-speed rail system sophisticated engineering and construction sectors capable of rapidly erecting dozens of ultramodern extermination camps and a world-leading chemical industry that could easily produce the compounds needed to eradicate millions swiftly and effectively.Contrasting the methods for mass killing used during the original Holocaust with the highly developed capabilities of Germany’s heavy-industry- and technology-focused economy of today legislators agreed Germany could “start wiping out entire villages tomorrow” if they ever felt like going through with another one.“Between 1939 and 1945 the German government exterminated more than 6 million Jews and 11 million victims overall and that was just with the genocide methods they had at the time” Bundestag delegate Matthias Becker told reporters noting that Germany’s cutting-edge telecommunications systems could be utilized to closely monitor track and capture every single targeted individual thereby completely eliminating the problem of Jewish flight that was experienced in the 1930s. “With so much state-of-the-art technology at our disposal we could reach that same death toll in half the time easy. Not that we ever would. That’s something so horrible you don’t even want to think about it but obviously we could if we wanted.”“If we were to start up again tomorrow—and keep in mind this is purely hypothetical—I think we could knock out at least 20 million by the end of the year” he added. “We most certainly will not do it but that’s how far Germany has advanced since the 1940s.”German officials further added that they have neither any political nor personal wishes for any mass murder to ever happen even though they technically could pull it off and it would likely go pretty smoothly. In addition authorities mentioned they theoretically wouldn’t even have to mass murder the same groups of people this time around with several throwing out the possibility of eradicating the country’s sizable Turkish minority and immigrants from East Asia before quickly noting that this is something that no one has any desire or intention to go through with.Perhaps most important lawmakers confirmed is that they have the benefit of hindsight allowing them to avoid the mistakes German leaders made 60 years earlier in their initial attempt to rid the world of the Jewish race.“Remember that the first time around resources were overextended by the ongoing war which is a problem we could definitely avoid if we ever did this again which we won’t” a high-level cabinet member explained of feasible though entirely nonexistent plans to kill millions upon millions of men women and children. “We have a pretty good idea now what brought an end to the horror and destruction that was the Holocaust so if it happened again—and God forbid it does—I’m sure that today’s Germany which is a far more advanced and prosperous nation could do it a lot better.”“I know we’re not going to do it but it’s kind of neat knowing that if we wanted to we could” he added. “We definitely could.”

You’ll need all the strength you have for the storm that’s coming.”“Let me put it this way” Jackson continued. “Remember the thing last year with that kid from Highland Park? Multiply that by a hundred.”According to sources familiar with the case what’s coming down the pipe is a “no-holds-barred whopper” that will make anything Reynolds has worked on before feel tame by comparison.Additionally CPS personnel confirmed Reynolds is going to want to hug her family “a lot.”“I don’t quite know how to put it but given the exact circumstances of the case don’t plan on making it home at the normal time for quite a while” said Jackson shaking his head and looking down at his feet. “Sheesh just thinking about it makes me a little uneasy and I’m not even the one who has to deal with that kettle of fish.”As word of the case spread throughout CPS’ downtown Detroit offices employees were reportedly sympathetic but at the same time grateful they hadn’t been assigned a case that they characterized as “oof” and “whoa just whoa.”CPS officials said that while Reynolds has a good head on her shoulders cases like these have been known to break even the most battle-hardened social worker. They acknowledged that in the past among those who have decided to continue with the profession after being assigned a first-rate hornet’s nest like this few were ever the same.“You’ve been here long enough to have paid your dues but after taking on this behemoth you’ll really be part of the CPS family” said Jackson handing an extra box of tissues to Reynolds. “So maybe I’ll just leave this case file here. You can go into the kitchen gather your thoughts for a little bit and when you’re ready have a look.”“Sweet fucking Jesus” continued Jackson who reportedly raised his eyebrows while exhaling deeply. “This thing’ll knock your socks off.”Jackson added that Reynolds has the skills the training and the experience to handle what’s in store and the only thing that’s left to say is “yikes.”

Sidwell affirmed that in spite of the challenges he remains determined to “give a wake-up call” regarding his supreme dickishness to everyone he meets by forcibly engaging them in debates in office break rooms personal residences bars internet message boards and grocery store checkout lines.According to the Truther most of the public remains “trapped inside a bubble” in which they ignorantly perceive him as a rational well-adjusted member of society. However he claimed he is making notable progress in convincing more and more of them of the “cold hard reality” every time he loudly interrupts a friend’s conversation in order to voice his suspicions concerning the whereabouts of the hijacked airliners’ missing black boxes.“Even though it’s clear that I’m an irritating dipshit it sometimes takes people a while before they’re willing to take off the blinders and come to their senses” said Sidwell who on a regular basis forwards lengthy chain emails containing unsourced accounts of missiles striking the Pentagon to everyone in his address book. “But when you look at the objective facts a clear picture begins to emerge: I have a compulsive need to engage in arguments in order to assert my intellectual superiority. I am in love with the sound of my own voice. I am not a good person.”“The more I reach out to others the more apparent all of that becomes” Sidwell added.Having spent years disrupting city council meetings and leaving inflammatory comments on every single YouTube video he watches regardless of its content sources predicted that it would not be long before Sidwell succeeded in his longtime goal of proving to the world that he is indeed a first-class shitheel.In fact numerous sources close to Sidwell acknowledged that he has already succeeded in alerting them to the accuracy of his endless obsessive claims that he is a jerkoff with many of these individuals telling reporters that they now wonder how they could have ever doubted him.“For the longest time I thought Victor was a levelheaded individual whom you could stand to be around without wanting to tear your hair out but eventually he was able to snap me out of my stupor” said Sidwell’s cousin Emily Hardin noting that she at last became convinced of the Truther’s detestable nature in the middle of his 40-minute diatribe on the potentially doctored wreckage photos of 7 World Trade Center at their last family Thanksgiving. “At first I was skeptical that he was an asshole but now I believe. His tendency to seek out confrontations his inability to talk about anything except 9/11 his refusal to let anyone else get a word in edgewise—it all adds up.”“He opened my eyes to what should have been clear from the start” she added.
2014-02-17T11:50:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/delighted-health-insurance-executives-gather-in-outdoor-1819576169,Delighted Health Insurance Executives Gather In Outdoor Coliseum To Watch Patient Battle Cancer,HARTFORD CT—Creating an electric and intimidating atmosphere with their cheers and vocal cries for blood throngs of health insurance executives reportedly crowded into a massive outdoor coliseum on Aetna’s corporate campus Monday to watch one of their policyholders engage in a life-or-death fight against cancer.Sources confirmed that the stone arena was filled to capacity for the highly anticipated spectacle with over 90000 officials attending from providers as far away as WellPoint Kaiser Permanente and HCSC to see if the patient could survive an intense brutal struggle with the advanced stage III illness.“Today we bring you one of our most thrilling challengers to date: a 57-year-old caucasian male with preexisting high blood pressure and a family history of heart disease” said Blue Cross Blue Shield CEO Scott Serota from an extravagantly decorated box seat his booming voice immediately silencing the raucous masses of middle-aged executives. “He holds a privately purchased Aetna PPO with a $400 monthly premium and $1500 annual deductible but faces the fight of his life against an aggressive form of multiple myeloma one of the most ruthless killers known to man.”“Bring out Aetna member #ABP80424!” Serota continued as the withered patient was wheeled into the sand-filled arena on a small gurney to loud boos and whistles. “Let the battle commence!”According to reports the policyholder who was equipped with limited resources of his own during the fight immediately faced the punishing and grave challenge of successfully submitting claims for a preliminary consultation with an out-of-network oncologist. As a slew of taunts and jeers rained down from the hordes of health insurance professionals sources said the increasingly weary combatant suffered a crushing blow upon receiving a $60000 bill for one week of inpatient care that exceeded his plan’s hospitalization coverage limit.A tense hush reportedly fell over the arena moments later when a CT scan showed the cancer on the brink of remission though the stadium soon erupted into emphatic cheers when the patient was not approved for further sessions of targeted chemotherapy that were deemed “medically unnecessary.”“He’s putting up a pretty strong fight but they really need to put an end to this soon—he’s starting to cost way more than he puts into his annual policy” Humana executive vice president James E. Murray said as the patient after making notable progress in obtaining a referral from his primary care physician was instantly bombarded with an overwhelming barrage of indecipherable paperwork required to justify a follow-up appointment at his radiation therapy clinic. “But overall though it’s been an incredible show. It was especially exciting watching him try to recover after they refused to cover his doctor’s treatment program for being experimental and medically unproven. Frankly I’m impressed that he even managed to come back from that.”“C’mon kill him already!” added a screaming Murray turning his attention back to the fight. “Finish that worthless scum!”Experts confirmed that such cancer battles—along with kidney disease battles and lengthier diabetes battles—have been held in the coliseum since its completion in the early 1960s and have remained a popular form of entertainment among American health insurance executives ever since. However demands for more graphic carnage have reportedly grown in recent decades with audiences clamoring to see patients become crippled by increasing premiums and left to die as insurers purposefully delay processing authorization forms for costly surgical procedures.The most famous of the coliseum’s challengers is said to be legendary Cigna plan member #ZH0115672 who bravely fought breast cancer for six years before finally succumbing to the disease in 2004. Sources said the 63-year-old policyholder almost incited riots in the stands after contesting a claim for post-operative mastectomy care through third-party arbitration though the situation was fortunately defused when the arbiter sided with the health care insurers.“Sometimes if the patient lasts long enough and things get a little too drawn-out we’ll unleash all the exclusions and caps we secretly hid throughout the contract for the most expensive medical services” said UnitedHealth chief financial officer David Wichmann watching closely as the policyholder darted back and forth between specialists to repair damage from the substandard care of a recommended in-network doctor. “It’s just a little fail-safe we have in our back pocket to make sure the crowds don’t get restless. Besides these patients know the risks when they step into the world of HMOs and high-deductible health plans.”“Oh he’s done for” Wichmann added as the helpless man fell to his knees and began begging for help paying his $800 monthly prescription of generic Zometa. “This is my favorite part—where we decide his fate.”At press time deafening chants of “Deny! Deny! Deny!” drowned out the patient’s desperate appeals against new coinsurance charges after which the president of Aetna reportedly smirked and slowly dragged his index finger across his throat.
2014-02-14T10:15:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/manic-researchers-announce-they-are-hours-away-from-cur-1819576149,Manic Researchers Announce They Are Hours Away From Cure For Depression,BLOOMINGTON IN—Speaking loudly and quickly without any notable pauses a team of manic researchers at Indiana University announced at a press conference Wednesday that they are mere hours away from a permanent cure for depression.The wide-eyed unblinking scientists who paced back and forth along the podium while nodding their heads vigorously told the assembled press corps that after they rounded up several hundred test subjects and carried out multiple clinical trials they expected to have a fully effective treatment for the mood disorder ready by this evening.“Depression is a serious and complex mental illness but there’s no reason we can’t solve it tonight—there’s nothing holding us back” said head researcher Dr. Gavin Rowe trembling euphorically as he mentioned that he felt “unstoppable” and had been working on the problem for the past 49 hours straight. “We’ll just run a few experiments in the next half hour develop a medication nail down some dosages and get rid of depression once and for all. That’s it. Christ we’re finally thinking clearly!”Punctuating their statements with broad forceful gestures the scientists explained that they were now making “15 or 20 medical breakthroughs a minute” and had written more than 350 pages of an academic paper during the morning that they intended to submit for publication immediately.Moreover the researchers vowed to conduct a randomized double-blind study right then and there on stage noting multiple times under their breath that “it’s all so simple.”“This research is basically doing itself—it’s not even hard” said neurologist Deborah Franks emitting an abrupt and ebullient peal of laughter before quickly returning to her explanation of how the research team was on the brink of eradicating an illness that has stymied medical science for centuries. “Sure identifying the neural underpinnings of a major mental disorder is a bit of a challenge but at the rate we’re flying through this research that’s nothing nothing at all. That’ll take five minutes.”“By this time tomorrow clinical depression will be completely gone” Franks continued. “Atypical depression postpartum depression seasonal depression—we’ll cure all of those. My God we’re so close! We’re on fire and nothing can ever stop us!”Several times throughout the press conference sources confirmed that the manic scientists alternately shouted at the press corps to get out of the room to let them think and then directly challenged the reporters to “name any disease” asserting that they would cure it on the spot.The ecstatic researchers who confirmed that their minds are working better and faster than they ever have before estimated that as soon as they wrapped up their clinical analysis this afternoon they would immediately receive congratulatory phone calls from the National Institutes of Health the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation every major pharmaceutical company the U.S. surgeon general and the Nobel Prize committee.“We’re on the verge of the greatest achievement in the history of medicine!” said Dr. Alejo Myron during a fast-paced 18-minute uninterrupted speech that included several dozen emphatic slaps of his open palm against the lectern. “Everything’s finally coming together: problem—solution. Hypothesis—data. Trial—outcome. It’s just like dominoes. We’re knocking all these tasks down one after another like dominoes just knocking it all down knocking it all down knocking it all down!”The team of researchers repeatedly pausing to scribble down ideas on notepads and mop beads of sweat from their brows assured reporters they did not need to sleep and would immediately turn their attention to shepherding the product through FDA safety evaluations vowing to bring the drug to market and personally administer it to every American with a depression diagnosis by the end of the week.Gesturing toward a chalkboard full of illegible calculations and sketches the team then told reporters that they were “invincible scientific juggernauts” who could “never fail ever.”“We’re going to raise so much money for this cure. We’re going to raise tons of money! When everyone sees what we’re on to they’ll want to give us thousands—no billions of dollars” geneticist Keith Dunbar said in a near shout while holding his quivering balled-up fists at chest-level. “Of course they will. We’re moments away from eliminating depression forever! We’ll probably even have time to make some headway on that schizophrenia MRI study that’s been sitting on the back burner. Oh and plus the literature review I’ve been meaning to do—I can fire that off in an hour. Then there’s Deborah’s chimp experiment and I can write up that bilateral lesion study from September!”“Actually you know what? I’m going to go do that now” he added before briskly striding off the podium.As of press time however each of the scientists had reportedly slumped to the ground in tears saying all the research they had ever done was “completely worthless” and admitting that clinical depression is likely impossible to cure.
2014-02-13T15:13:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/nation-s-girlfriends-admit-absolutely-everything-riding-1819576156,Nation’s Girlfriends Admit Absolutely Everything Riding On Valentine’s Day,WASHINGTON—Confirming that it’s “all come down to this” the nation’s girlfriends admitted Thursday that despite anything they may have said or implied in the past absolutely everything hinges on the outcome of this Valentine’s Day.Describing the evening as “the indisputable make-or-break moment of our relationships” the girlfriends explained that if Valentine’s Day fails in any way to live up to their standards or if at any point they sense that not enough effort went into the occasion then things are as good as over.“Look I’m gonna cut the shit here: I’ve basically funneled all my hopes for the future into this one night in which my boyfriend must achieve perfection or else we’re through” Virginia Beach area girlfriend Jenna Boyce 27 told reporters noting that she will be able to tell immediately if her boyfriend cheaps out on the flowers he has bought her or throws his gift together at the very last minute. “I expect an amazing thoughtful nearly flawless experience one that is simultaneously fun and romantic and a night I will remember for the rest of my life. Anything short of that and I walk.”“I know I’ve stated in the past that I believe Valentine’s Day is dumb and that it’s a commercial holiday and that it doesn’t matter to me but I was lying” Boyce added in total concurrence with every other girlfriend in the country. “That was total horseshit. I in fact care more about this than anything by far.”The nation’s girlfriends admitted to reporters and to anyone who cared to know that nothing their boyfriends have ever done for them in the past including any and all good deeds previously rendered will matter in the slightest if they don’t make tomorrow a day to remember.The assembled women then confirmed that they expect the following things tomorrow and they “don’t give one flying fuck” if these expectations make them appear either old-fashioned demanding or unrealistic: flowers; repeated romantic gestures and signs of physical affection; compliments; assorted gifts of an emotionally resonant nature; a dinner that is sufficiently high-end yet also warm and intimate; two to three fond recollections of the relationship’s origins; an outfit and attention to personal dress on the part of the boyfriend that shows he cares; extended eye contact; highly engaged conversation; no spared details; no mistakes; no jokes that in any way undermine the seriousness and romantic gravity of the evening; no mention of money or cost; and a minimum of 25 utterances of the word “love.”“And if you don’t like it that is too fucking bad because this is the attitude I am walking into tomorrow with and there is nothing you or anyone else can do to alter or subdue that attitude” said Seattle area girlfriend Sonia Moreno 31 noting that Valentine’s Day will be the sole metric she will use to gauge her boyfriend’s worth and romantic commitment. “That’s the reality. It’s all come down to this. And so come tomorrow I suppose myself and every girlfriend in America will find out for sure if their relationship has a future or not.”The nation’s girlfriends also confirmed that if their boyfriends are able to go all out and make tomorrow truly special then there is no reason why they couldn’t make a similar effort on every other day of the year too.

Halfon then quietly laughed before telling reporters that he swore “it was only yesterday” he was rocking his daughter to sleep in the bedroom he is no longer allowed in.In addition Halfon suggested that new parents cherish their children while they are still young expressing his astonishment at just how much time has gone by since his son and daughter said their first words or anything at all to him.“You really notice how much your kids have grown apart during those big milestones” said Halfon citing his son’s first after-school job he was never informed of and his daughter’s senior musical which he only learned about through Facebook photos. “My son Michael just left to go hang out with his girlfriend whom he has no desire to ever introduce me to and I still can’t believe my daughter Elizabeth is now searching for colleges without me.”“I just have to accept that she’s no longer a little girl who speaks and makes eye contact with me” Halfon added.Explaining that it is simply a part of life Halfon told reporters that before he knows it his children will be moving out of the family home that they mentally checked out of years ago. The local father then added that it’s only a matter of time before he hears that his children have found apartments of their own started their careers and settled down with partners likely during brief once-per-month conversations when his kids finally decide to return his phone calls.Additionally Halfon marveled that the day was not far off when his children would have remote alienated children of their own.“Sometimes I forget that Elizabeth and Michael are practically fully estranged adults now” said Halfon looking through old family photos from when his daughter hadn’t yet learned to walk or ignore him entirely. “You catch yourself expecting them to call you Daddy instead of resentfully scoffing at your presence like they’re 5 years old again. But I just have to remind myself those days are over.”“At this point” added Halfon “I just have to step back and let them go off and do well—I don’t know—whatever it is they like doing.”As of press time Halfon’s children had completely disregarded their father’s requests for comment.
2014-02-11T12:50:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/nitro-expected-to-win-westminster-dog-fight-1819576141,Nitro Expected To Win Westminster Dog Fight,NEW YORK—Lauding his sturdy build immaculate pedigree and unparalleled ability to latch onto opponents’ throats until they bleed to death sources confirmed today that purebred American pit bull terrier Nitro is widely expected to secure top honors at this year’s Westminster Kennel Club Dog Fight.As the most vicious canines among each of the club’s 190 recognized breeds square off Tuesday night Nitro is reportedly the odds-on favorite to win it all having already mercilessly ripped apart each of his opponents to become the last pit bull remaining in the nation’s most prestigious dog fighting competition.“Since 1877 the Westminster Dog Fight has featured only the finest bred and most brutally trained competitors and Nitro is one of the deadliest specimens we’ve seen in years” said Sporting Dog Journal columnist Mark Halberstrom adding that judges would give the 3-year-old animal high scores in categories such as jaw-clamping strength incisor sharpness and overall bloodlust. “He’ll likely tear his way through the toy breeds very quickly tossing the Yorkshire terriers the Maltese and the pugs around like throw pillows.”“I was pitside last year when it took him 11 seconds to reduce a Bichon Frise to a pile of bloodied fluff” Halberstrom continued. “He’s just a beautiful beautiful killing machine.”At the Westminster Dog Fight held annually in the basement of New York’s Port Authority Bus Terminal Nitro will vie for glory against well-bred opponents who bear the mangy coats shorn ears and infected staple-bound lacerations that are the hallmarks of the sport’s true elite. According to insiders he has already won numerous regional matches against such infamous veterans of the dog fight circuit as Razor Jaw Sergeant Darkness Bricks Scarface IV and Cerberus.While his natural talent can perhaps be attributed to his rarefied lineage—he was sired by 2006 Westminster Dog Fight victor Jackknife—much of his success is reportedly due to his work with legendary trainer Rusty “Ratchet” Caldwell who is said to have kept Nitro chained to a water heater from an early age forced him to run on a treadmill and administered a strict regimen of beatings with a lead pipe.The 55-pound pit bull was also fed a standard diet of hamburger meat shelter kittens anabolic steroids and gunpowder sources stated.“Only once or twice in a generation are we presented with a fight dog like this” said blood-sport enthusiast Trevor Wilburn who described watching Nitro methodically take apart a former police dog during a match at an abandoned foundry in Tupelo MS. “He has the poise the genetics and the raw savagery necessary to achieve true greatness.”“I’d say the only two dogs who have a chance to win are Nitro and maybe [180-pound Tibetan mastiff] Dreamcatcher” Wilburn added.Caldwell however expressed total confidence that Nitro would be the one taking the victory trot back to his cage. The trainer said he would be rewarding his dog with a saline IV drip and 160 mg of Oxycontin while any other animals still alive after the fight would inevitably be drowned electrocuted or shot in the head.“I know he has what it takes to avoid being carried out of Westminster in a trash bag” Caldwell said. “And for me there’s nothing more satisfying than shaping a dog into a maniacal killer from the moment of its birth torturing and starving it for years and then forcing it to fight for its significantly shortened life.”“That being said this nasty son of a bitch right here is also going to make me a lot of fucking money” he added hoisting Nitro up by his tail.
2014-02-10T16:01:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/humanity-forced-to-put-down-aging-god-1819576138,Humanity Forced To Put Down Aging God,THE HEAVENS—Citing an inability to adequately care for the aging all-powerful deity members of the human race told reporters Monday that they were forced to put down God the omniscient creator worshipped by billions of followers of various faiths for more than 6000 years.“This is something we’ve been putting off for a long time but at the end of the day it’s what’s best for Him” said human Daniel Whiting of Appleton WI acknowledging that the “difficult decision” comes after years of dealing with The Divine Creator’s sapped energy urinary tract infections recurring blindness in His left eye and noticeable lack of strength and enthusiasm. “At some point you just have to think about what will make God suffer less: letting Him live in pain for a thousand more years or just letting Him go peacefully in His sleep now?”“Sure it was a difficult decision but it was inevitable” concurred Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Vatican City. “After all He was already 13 billion years old.”According to sources at approximately 1:34 p.m. Monday afternoon the elderly Almighty Father was injected with a high dosage of pentobarbital allowing Him to slowly drift to sleep before experiencing painless cardiac arrest followed immediately by death.In the hours since the passing of The Maker of Heaven and Earth the human race told reporters that while they certainly missed having Him around they preferred to enjoy their fond memories of a younger and more energetic God.“The excitability and joy for life He used to radiate was infectious” said Maria Castellanos of Guadalajara Mexico referring to the days when the Divine Being would friskily follow the human race wherever they went and “get Himself into all kinds of trouble.” “But for the last millennia or so He spent most of His time just moping around—rarely ever using His omnipotence and barely even capable of rendering miracles and answering prayers. He hardly even acknowledged [humanity] as we went about our day really.”“He was just sort of there” Castellanos added. “And as much as we enjoyed having Him around He just didn’t have it in Him to do the things He used to love to do.”The world’s 7.14 billion people went on to admit that there were numerous instances when they considered putting God to sleep but ultimately relented.“There was a time around the third century B.C. when God was just so aggressive and uncontrollable we thought we’d definitely have to put Him down” Harvard theologian Peter Gomes said this week. “And there were some other close calls like the time He was hit by a car in 1983. But He always bounced back. This time though we finally had to acknowledge that it was time to say goodbye.”Despite reporting a distinct feeling of sadness and loss the human race confirmed today that they were also reminiscing on many memories of the Supreme Lord and Savior’s life from His very first creation of the heavens and earth to the time He rambunctiously flooded the earth for 150 days to His allowance of the Holocaust from 1938 to 1945 to the sweet sunset he conjured on the evening of July 12 1998.“The thing that makes me feel better is knowing that He had a great life even when things got a little rough at the very end” Beijing-area human Huai Cheng said. “It’ll be hard letting go but when it’s the right time we’ll talk about getting another God.”“Maybe even two of them” Huai added.
2014-02-07T15:15:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/lapsed-cult-member-only-attends-sanctum-on-major-bloodl-1819576134,Lapsed Cult Member Only Attends Sanctum On Major Bloodletting Holidays,WHITEBRIDGE NE—Admitting that he has become “more of a casual follower” in recent years local Infinite Light cult member Stephen Walsh 31 told reporters Friday that he now only attends sanctum on the faith’s major bloodletting holidays.“To be honest I’ve only been to sanctum maybe three or four times in the last couple years and only on the most important Self-Energy Offering days” said Walsh acknowledging that over the past 12 months his only visits to the master compound have come on the Celestial Beckoning and the trillion-year anniversary of the Trans-Galactic Plague. “I really haven’t consistently gone to the weekly Thought Purges since I was a teenager. And I can’t even remember the last time I sat down with a Purity Guide and had my life-elementals processed.”“Of course I still have faith in Terry—I still believe he was sent by the galactic Overseers to give us the Teachings” he continued noting that while he has an old Existence Manual “lying around somewhere” he hasn’t picked it up in years. “You know you just get older you become busy with school or a job and the thought of progressing up the Ladder to Time-Body Liberation is not your top priority any longer.”Raised in a family of devout Infinite Light adherents Walsh reportedly carried out the cult’s self-reprimanding rites each night and took the Astral Submission Oath at age 14 alongside his peers. However beginning in his early 20s Walsh said he began to “drift away” from the cult that he had grown up in and to which he pledged his undying fealty for the next 199 lifetimes.According to Walsh as soon as he entered college he discontinued attending sanctum altogether acknowledging that without his parents to coax him to put on his mylar-lined bodysuit and visit the compound every Thursday at sundown he simply lost the motivation to recite the Decoding and communally apply the serum every week.“Back when I was growing up we’d always get to sanctum early sit on the floor circles closest to the great aluminum rod then stay perfectly still for four hours before washing ourselves in the fluids” said Walsh recalling that he used to be “very active” in the cult’s outreach missions to find outsiders place them in the Holding Room and mentally project the Teaching toward them for hours on end. “Back then I knew the Existence Manual back to front. But now I’m lucky if I can name even half of Terry’s 31 proclamations on male hygiene.”“You grow up carving the secret names of the Overseers into living animals hundreds of times and you just get a little sick of it” he added. “Honestly it’s pretty boring to sit in sanctum week after week and hear some old Existence Guide rehash the same tired stories about Terry transforming himself into radio waves and visiting the destination galaxy. It gets a little old you know?”Though Walsh confirmed he still observes cultural traditions of The Purpose—such as hanging a picture of Terry in his home burying guns in his yard and humming to align his life-elementals in preparation for the day Terry leads his followers from Earth—he admitted that it has been “ages” since he last went to the bunker in Fort Davis to add his seed to the communal Mingling Vessel to help the cult’s Head-Mother bear a child.“I can’t say I miss the electroconvulsive purges every week—and at this point I no longer agree with the Overseers’ outdated views that women shouldn’t be allowed to eat meat—but what I do miss is the sense of connection with other followers” Walsh said. “The togetherness I felt when the entire Collective met in the compound basement rubbed the serum over each other’s naked bodies and engaged in the ritual nightlong mass copulation ceremony—it was really nice having that sense of community as part of my life.”“Maybe when I have kids I’ll get back into the whole thing” he continued admitting that he enjoyed the thought of attending sanctum as a family and even one day visiting the settlement in Nicaragua where they could all learn to communicate with the Overseers via the electrostatic signals on analog televisions and radios. “But for now I don’t know. Incanting Terry’s name in all 200 galactic languages just isn’t how I want to spend my Thursdays.”In spite of Walsh’s current distance from the cult his mother Susan Walsh expressed confidence that he would eventually return to the Collective recalling a similar phase in her youth when she stopped attending sanctum and allowed The Purpose to become a secondary part of her life.“We all go through times when we lose sight of the Final Way—periods when we stray from Terry” the 64-year-old cult member said after painting a triangle of her own blood on her forehead. “But it is then that the Overseers seek us out bring us back to them and remind us of the Fundamental Truth: We are all electromagnetic particles and Terry will guide us to the pole star.”“We are all electromagnetic particles and Terry will guide us to the pole star” she then began to mutter repeatedly. “We are all electromagnetic particles and Terry will guide us to the pole star.”
2014-02-07T14:32:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/renovations-force-yosemite-national-park-to-temporarily-1819576123,Renovations Force Yosemite National Park To Temporarily Relocate To Sacramento Office Space,SACRAMENTO CA—Officials at Yosemite National Park confirmed Friday that in an effort to accommodate necessary renovations and expedite routine maintenance the entirety of the park’s breathtaking wilderness has been temporarily relocated to a Sacramento office space.Earlier this week Yosemite employees said they transferred thousands of lakes 1600 miles of streams colossal stretches of old-growth forest 250 species of vertebrates Bridalveil Fall and countless granite crags to a 3000-square-foot commercial office space in the local North Pointe Business Center where they’ve since been busy settling into their new workplace.“It’s a tighter space than we’re used to but it’s a sacrifice we’re glad to make if it means we’ll eventually have a nicer park” said Yosemite superintendent Don Neubacher who spearheaded the process of moving the sprawling populations of unhampered flora and fauna into the makeshift office. “Besides we’ve got two whole floors to ourselves and for the most part it’s been business as usual around here.”“Sure the herd animals are used to roaming across a larger expanse of terrain but we feel the open-floor office plan we have here is really working to their advantage” he added.Neubacher acknowledged that the new environs had been an adjustment for many of the animals noting for example that the park’s marmots initially seemed upset about having to share a cubicle with its black bears. But before long he said the marmots had burrowed down into a recycling bin to hibernate and the bears had discovered the kitchenette where they ripped the door off the refrigerator and devoured everything inside.There are other inconveniences: Space constraints reportedly forced employees to move a number of the park’s larger mountains and river systems into off-site storage units and most of Yosemite’s astonishing diversity of plant life is now confined to pots lining the windows of workspaces.On top of that sources stated the 1900-year-old giant sequoia tree in the office’s reception area requires almost constant watering.“We’re making do” Yosemite ranger Jess Rymer said as she shooed a family of pine martens away from the photocopier. “Space is at a premium and sometimes that means the conference room gets double-booked or the city gets on our case because a massive protrusion of igneous rock is blocking a fire exit and our sprinkler system can’t keep up with the controlled burns we have to conduct as part of our forest management program.”“But luckily the building’s owners have been very accommodating” she continued. “They were totally cool when we needed to store Glacier Point in the lobby for a while until we got our furniture arranged.”According to sources the park’s presence in the office complex has been hard to ignore with the forces of nature—whether it’s the vast alpine woodlands in the mailroom or a terrified owl stuck in the revolving doors—occasionally intruding on public spaces.But even if from time to time they open the door of a restroom stall and are startled by the sight of a cougar tearing into the belly of a bighorn sheep Yosemite’s fellow tenants told reporters they don’t generally mind.“Every once in a while you’ll show up to find a towering geologic formation in your parking space but overall Yosemite National Park isn’t bad to have around” said Graham Martin an analyst at a neighboring brokerage firm. “The mule deer are always very polite. And I’m on the same schedule as this one breathtaking gorge; we’re always bumping into each other in the elevator.”Despite the fact that they’ll have to find a way to accommodate the several hundred thousand campers hikers and rock climbers expected to visit their Sacramento office between now and Memorial Day when renovations on their permanent location are complete Yosemite officials said they believe selecting a temporary office will have been the right choice.“It’ll do” said Superintendent Neubacher speaking softly so as not to disturb a pit of king snakes in his desk drawer. “It has to. Our only other option is to work from home.”

What if I develop an axial tilt that fosters a mild global climate? It’s terrifying to admit but my surface temperature already sometimes drops to 120 degrees Fahrenheit at night and their species can technically survive in that.”“Stuff like that really freaks me out” the extrasolar planet continued. “The real doomsday scenario would be someday acquiring a breathable atmosphere rich with oxygen and ultraviolet-absorbing ozone. At that point I might as well just hurl myself at the nearest black hole and be done with it.”In an effort to allay its deep-seated fears of human habitation WR 67c said it often reminds itself that its surface is constantly ravaged by devastating asteroid impacts and is perpetually showered by corrosive rains of pure sulfuric acid. However because it occupies what Earth scientists have dubbed the habitable zone of its nearby star the planet confessed that it often succumbs to sudden panic attacks in which it becomes intensely paranoid that it is developing liquid water on its crust.The silicate-based planet also expressed a similarly crippling worry that any of its six moons could one day develop atmospheric pressure and gravity levels suitable for the human body underscoring that it does not want humans “within 100 parsecs” of its orbit.“Boy I can only imagine what that awful species would do to me if they found out I have an abundance of rich mineral deposits deep within me” said WR 67c noting that the prospect of human scientists discovering its existence has already led to debilitating bouts of stress and anxiety. “Those horrible organisms have already developed the technology for short-distance space travel and it’s probably only a matter of time before they figure out how to voyage through interstellar space.”“It’s almost like I can already feel them crawling all over my surface infesting every inch of my crust” the planet added shuddering. “Ugh it’s best not to even think about it.”Despite its opposition to human life WR 67c admitted no such reservations toward harboring other carbon-based lifeforms noting that most are harmless and actually tend to form a peaceful and pleasant symbiosis with their surroundings.“Honestly I really wouldn’t mind having certain living organisms” WR 67c said. “Prokaryotes or maybe some unicellular Mycetozoa would be totally fine—in fact those kinds of species would be more than welcome. And most plants or animals really wouldn’t bother me in the slightest. I could actually see myself happily accommodating a variety of biomes for all sorts of organisms.”“Just not humans” the planet quickly added. “Seriously anything but those parasites.”Given that its size is roughly three times that of Earth WR 67c acknowledged with considerable apprehension that it could theoretically house tens of billions of humans—far more than the Earth’s capacity—a prospect it said was “too terrifying to contemplate.” The distant terrestrial world then confirmed that should human beings ever safely step foot on its surface it would do everything in its power to generate devastating volcanic activity and seismic instability in an effort to repel them.However if it proved unable to shake the species the planet said it hoped for the nearby Wolf-Rayet star to immediately go supernova instantly obliterating all orbiting planets in a cataclysmic burst of thermonuclear energy.“It’s absolutely horrifying to think of human beings living off my geochemistry and atmosphere but to be honest if I can just get through the next 50 or so Earth years I should be in the clear” WR 67c said. “They’ll definitely all be dead by then.”
2014-02-03T14:29:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/57-women-stoned-to-death-during-annual-riyadh-fashion-w-1819576115,57 Women Stoned To Death During Annual Riyadh Fashion Week,RIYADH SAUDI ARABIA—With local organizers and attendees hailing the event as a “major success” the Saudi Arabian capital Riyadh wrapped up its 10th annual fashion week Friday a star-studded international showcase of the latest trends during which 57 women were pelted to death by stones.The glamorous high-fashion event which debuted the fall couture collections of Calvin Klein Diane Von Furstenberg and Anna Sui among others took place over seven days in the city’s upscale Olaya district and claimed the lives of dozens of models assistants and designers as well as 19 female audience members whose outfits exposed parts of their bodies other than their eyes or hands.“Riyadh Fashion Week is the place to be to check out the newest styles and kill the women wearing them” said local fruit seller Salman Awad who claimed that this was his favorite of the six Fashion Weeks he’s attended as he was able to take out the eye of a model wearing a brocade tunic at Tuesday’s Vivienne Tam show. “My friends and I made sure to line up outside the tents before dawn to get good seats close to the front. It’s a lot easier to hit them in the head that way.”“I’m already starting to save up my rocks for next year’s Fashion Week” Awad added. “I can’t wait.”Fashion Week organizers confirmed that this year’s turnout was the highest in the event’s history attracting thousands of eager stone-wielding visitors from all over the Middle East. According to event staff every runway show was standing room only with fashion industry elites and celebrities rubbing elbows at top designers’ collection debuts and glitzy brand-sponsored after-parties alongside Saudi locals demanding to know which if any of the women had received permission to be there from either their husbands or a male member of their family.This year’s event kicked off last Saturday with a chic multi-designer exhibition in the plush Kingdom Centre during which audience members were reportedly stirred into a frenzy of anticipation even before the show began by large-screen projections of the hottest current fashion trends in Paris and Milan. Sources described the show as a “stunning spectacle” with enthusiastic crowd members bombarding models one by one as they came out onto the catwalk leaving a growing mound of bloodied female bodies and high-end custom-fitted gowns and accessories on stage.In addition to the stonings sources confirmed that during a disco-themed show Wednesday night featuring Jay Godfrey’s 2014 resort-wear line attendees ran out of projectiles and were forced to rush the stage and strangle several models to death with their own $1100 ruched cowl-neck tops all while renowned DJ Geordon Nicol spun a live dance music set.“From where I was sitting I had a great view of Oscar de la Renta getting beheaded just a few rows in front of me” said first-time Fashion Week visitor Faisal Qureshi. “When I bought my ticket I was only planning to hurl rocks at the models on the runway but once everybody started chanting ‘Death to Western infidels’ I ended up joining in on the melee and pummeling several hairstylists and makeup artists who looked like homosexuals.”“It was the best fashion show I’ve ever been to” he continued. “I got to personally hold down and help castrate three sodomites.”While each year at least five or six women are stoned to death at Riyadh Fashion Week organizers confirmed that this was by far the largest number killed since 2009 when 21 women modeling the DKNY summer line had their skulls bashed in with rocks as they changed backstage. Those who survived the initial bludgeoning and made it out to model that year’s high-waisted halter bikinis were reportedly met by a frenzied audience that threw cups of acid on their faces and bodies.However organizers say the event’s popularity has grown to such an extent that they are thinking of expanding the number of shows in the future.“In Saudi Arabia there’s a new generation of fashion-conscious citizens who want to stone the next big thing” said Riyadh Fashion Week executive director Hakim Moghadam. “Whether it’s heaving rocks at the new Zac Posen ready-to-wear collection or giving hundreds of lashes to anyone sporting BCBGMAXAZRIA they want to be a part of the scene.”“And we want to let everyone across the Kingdom know that they don’t have to travel to London or New York” he continued. “They can slaughter the immodest in their own backyard right here in Riyadh.”

Already they are reportedly starting to sense that you’ve just been skating by—pretending to know what you’re talking about as if you actually possess any kind of real or meaningful skills—and that you’re far more of a liability to the company than you’ve ever been an asset.Several experts also noted that any potential employer in your future will immediately recognize that your entire career has been a sham that you more or less bluffed your way through school and that you’re unfit for any task beyond menial labor.According to the report the people you are closest to from friends to family to your romantic partner will find out today that you’ve merely been impersonating someone who deserves to be in their lives—piecing together just enough lies about yourself to trick them into thinking you’re a genuine understanding person.In addition to everyone you’ve ever met knowing you’re a huge imposter even strangers on the street will know the report stated in most cases simply by looking at you.“People will soon surmise that you’re just a feeble self-obsessed loser scraping by from day to day and hoping not to get found out and you know what? They’re right” reads another section of the report. “The pathetic deceit that lies at the very core of your being that defines you that is you won’t be a secret much longer because the rest of the world is going to figure out what your parents have known all along: You’re a big fucking joke.”“On some level deep down you knew this day had to come” the report concludes. “And now it has.”At press time sources confirmed that here we go: You can see it in their eyes. They know. They all know. Every last one of them absolutely knows. And you deserve every bit of scorn and rejection that is coming your way.

The study also indicated that the cute European passenger you smiled at on that train when you were traveling abroad still fantasizes about the passionate unrestrained romance the two of you would have shared had you only introduced yourself.Furthermore the study proved that that one summer camp counselor your close friend’s older sibling the student teacher from your 11th-grade history class that jogger whom you often see running in your neighborhood your old physics lab partner and the foreign exchange student who attended your high school for a semester all take great pleasure in imagining a life together with you.“Our research also suggests that all it would take to begin a fulfilling and lasting romantic partnership with any one of your crushes is a simple Facebook message or text” said Taylor confirming that several of your current colleagues your friend’s romantic partner and dozens of other individuals with whom you were once infatuated are all currently and eagerly waiting for you to make the first move. “Right this very second you could simply call up any one of these former and current crushes and begin an intensely gratifying lifelong relationship. We can say with certainty that each of these people have been waiting for you—aching for you every waking moment—this entire time. And they have no other wish than for you to make their fantasies a reality by expressing your own infatuation. In fact nothing would give them greater pleasure.”“A life of bliss with anyone you’ve ever felt attracted to is only a call or email away” Taylor added. “The question isn’t whether they desire you but whether you have what it takes to contact them and make that perfect life a reality.”

In addition to having a strong youthful body and a boundless spirit of spontaneity the surgeon general stressed that being 19 was exactly what U.S. citizens needed to feel free—truly free—from their responsibilities and to instill in them the confidence that they could do anything they wanted in this world.“Based on our findings it is the recommendation of the Office of the Surgeon General that each and every American be in their late teens without a care in their mind and with just enough money to get by for the next few days because when you’re 19 the next few days are all that matter” said Lushniak stressing the importance of being old enough to do whatever you want but not old enough to give a damn about the consequences. “We found that every single American would greatly benefit from not having a 9-to-5 keeping them busy or a family at home—just a minimum-wage job they can ditch whenever they want to visit a buddy down in the city or go swimming in the quarry on a nice summer day.”“We predict that most Americans would enjoy a sharp improvement in their quality of life if they were 19” Lushniak added. “Especially if they could still hit up their folks for some dough every so often and if they had a decent place with a few cool roommates that wasn’t much but was nice enough.”Alleging that the average person’s cares were at a minimum at 19 and that one’s sense of adventure and willingness to “stay up and see where the night takes them” was at its peak Lushniak advised all American adults to return to their post-adolescent pre-adult lives as soon as possible. Additionally Lushniak noted that Americans would experience a profound reduction in stress and fatigue by being 19 explaining that the only worries on a 19-year-old’s mind are “which couch they could crash on for the night” and “where to score a case of beer.”Though Lushniak stated that being 19 involves a certain level of risk noting that such individuals were highly susceptible to stupid reckless decisions he assured reporters that such mistakes didn’t have serious consequences because you’re only 19 and damned if it doesn’t feel like you’re going to live forever. Moreover Lushniak emphasized that the potential benefits of getting into a little trouble here and there from joyriding with some buddies to jumping the state park fence and skinny-dipping after dark far outweighed any potential negative side effects.“We found a wide variety of tangible benefits to being 19 from staying out until dawn and watching the sun come up over the lake with friends to turning up the music as loud as it goes and never feeling more alive” said Lushniak who also urged citizens to smoke a few cigarettes or a joint if they wanted as that’s what being 19 is all about. “It is the opinion of this office that the world is yours when you’re 19. It’s really truly yours.”Furthermore Lushniak stressed that if possible Americans should be at an age where they could put their whole paycheck toward an old motorcycle one they could fix up and take out on the open road whenever they wanted day or night. According to Lushniak taking your bike and making your way across the country with no other plan than to have a good time wherever you could find it was associated with overwhelmingly positive outcomes among all subjects.In addition Lushniak recommended scoring a fake ID; chasing some tail; feeling the breeze on your face and the sun on your bare shoulders; bonfires; laughing with your friends at 3 a.m. until it hurt; and getting that tattoo you want because who’s going to tell you no?“Yes I can say with utmost confidence that I think all Americans should be 19” said Lushniak a faint smile appearing on his lips as he looked off into the middle distance. “And once you’re 19 it is the government’s recommendation that you find yourself a nice pretty girl and tell her to hold on tight while you point your bike to the west. Then just feel her grip growing tighter around your waist as you ride off wherever the road takes you. It doesn’t get any better than that—no there’s nothing better than that at all.”After pausing several seconds Lushniak added that for many citizens however being 19 was no longer a viable possibility before sighing noting with visible dismay that some Americans were stuck being 54 and solemnly stepping away from the lectern.

It was incredible. I mean what a show.”“The best part was the splash—it was huge!” Carr added. “Hell sign me up SeaWorld because I am all in!”Radically reversing months of intense backlash over the marine park’s care and training of dozens of orca whales in captivity Americans across the nation confirmed that “all bets were off now” and that they needed to get to SeaWorld as soon as possible if they wanted to see Kayla do another “crazy sick-as-hell” trick.In particular millions of citizens confirmed that in addition to watching Kayla do another backflip out of her tank they were excited to see her get more fish from her trainer and smile another big happy smile.If they were lucky Americans confirmed they may get to see two orcas do a flip at the same time which would be “seriously insane.”“What can I say? I had SeaWorld all wrong—I had myself convinced they were some sort of exploitative company that abused animals in the pursuit of cheap thrills for tourists but then I saw that orca make a big wave by slapping the water with his fin and I was like ‘Hold the phone I need to see that again’” environmental reporter Craig Edmonds said while imitating the whale’s motion with his arms. “How do they even learn that stuff? It’s incredible. All I know is there’d better be more where that came from because you have most definitely won yourself a new fan SeaWorld.”According to a recent survey when reminded of the recent controversy surrounding the documented physical and emotional dangers of producing orca shows 88 percent of Americans responded “Granted but did you see how high that orca got? She must’ve been two feet up in the air!” In addition more than 90 percent of Americans said that they were “highly disappointed” they didn’t get to see the whales come totally out of the water and squirt audience members with their blowholes while an additional 70 percent said the music should have been even louder because it made the whole routine “way more badass.”Two in three Americans also reported that moving forward they’d like to see whales do two flips in a row instead of one.“Sometimes one of the trainers will swim with them or even ride on one of them like they’re a surfboard which is the fucking best because how cool would that be to ride an orca like a surfboard?” said marine biologist Jackson Cahn adding that he is officially renouncing his campaign urging the government to take legal action against SeaWorld. “Man I wish I could ride one. I’m gonna go down to Orlando and try to touch one for sure.”“I mean all in all SeaWorld is a pretty magical place when you think about it” he added.

The names of these participants hundreds upon hundreds of whom will not even make it to the semifinals of their events will soon become and forever remain euphemisms for disappointment defeat and incompetency in their countries of origin sources added.With athletes still fine-tuning their skills through obsessive training regimens and endless practice runs observers noted that the footage of their soon-to-arrive deflating moments will be constantly replayed during the lead-up to every subsequent Winter Olympics as a reminder of their dishonor.“These young men and women have dedicated so much of their lives to competing in these games and we’re all very excited to see their hard work pay off” said U.S. ski trainer Adam Yang referring to the collection of individuals whose failure and shame will immortalize them as despised figures amongst those who once trumpeted them as heroes and held them up as exemplars of personal dedication and sacrifice. “Now they get to go out compete and enjoy the spirit of the Olympic Games.”“It really is wonderful” he added.After training a minimum of six hours a day for more than a decade and with the self-respect of an entire nation hinging upon them many of those competing at Sochi will suffer utter embarrassment and fall into permanent disrepute as the result of a single error in their performance sources confirmed and they will never again find the courage to take on another challenge of any kind athletic or otherwise as long as they live.Longstanding stains upon the dignity of their native lands these has-been Olympians will reportedly live out the remainder of their days as alcoholic recluses.“I’ve given all I can give to get to this point” said Israeli figure skater Rebekah Abramovich who at 15 is young enough that she may after completely disgracing herself in Russia have the opportunity to humiliate herself all over again at the 2018 Winter Games in South Korea as heartbreaking as that sounds. “And now I’m just going to go out there and do my best.”“I’ve been dreaming of this moment since I was a little girl” she added.
2014-01-20T14:38:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/genius-magazine-editor-does-it-again-with-marilyn-monro-1819576024,Genius Magazine Editor Does It Again With Marilyn Monroe–Inspired Photoshoot,NEW YORK—Since it first hit newsstands the February issue of Elle has reportedly held the publishing world in awe with its groundbreaking Marilyn Monroe–inspired photo spread which has been hailed as yet another dazzling milestone in the career of visionary photo editor Allison Shields.The powerfully original 12-page spread in which the actress Amy Adams recreates several iconic photos of the late Hollywood starlet has earned Shields lavish amounts of praise as a “creative genius” and an “artistic mastermind years ahead of her time” sources confirmed Monday.“Not only did she have the incredible vision to recreate the famous image of Marilyn holding down her dress over a New York City subway grate but she also had the brilliance—the audacity even—to put Amy in a dress identical to the one Marilyn was wearing” said Elle senior editor Clara Buckingham adding that the first time she saw the negatives she was “absolutely blown away.” “They did her hair and makeup the same and everything. It was amazing.”“Taking a celebrity from today and dressing her up like a celebrity from a long time ago—how did she come up with that?” Buckingham continued. “On one level it’s an homage but on another deeper level it’s a commentary on how much things stay the same even as they change.”According to Buckingham the Adams photoshoot is only the latest example of Shields’s “truly ahead-of-the-curve photographic genius.” A feature last October in which comedian Jerry Seinfeld was dressed up as a clown and photographed at a deserted carnival similarly “oozed with originality” she said as did a July shoot in which Shields had the boy band One Direction reenact the Beatles’ Abbey Road album cover.Last month Shields triggered an eruption of positive buzz after shooting the bare-shouldered musician Pink as she bit into an apple evoking the biblical figure of Eve in a collection of images that industry sources said solidified the 42-year-old’s reputation as one of the most forward-thinking and wildly unpredictable photo editors in American fashion today.“It takes an out-of-the-box thinker like Allison to stumble upon the idea of reaching to the past for inspiration” said managing editor Corrie Ross who admitted she gets chills whenever Shields has photos digitally aged to resemble the originals that inspired them. “You see her work and you think ‘Wow I wish I’d thought of that.’ But of course you or I never could have. That’s what makes her such a genius.”“And now she’s outdone herself yet again” Ross added. “I guess that’s why we pay her $400000 a year.”Colleagues said Shields’s creative mastery lies in her ability to challenge her audience’s expectations whether by photographing the cast of Girls as debauched Jazz Age flappers or unexpectedly switching genres and shooting Seth Rogen Jonah Hill and Danny McBride as Shakespearean thespians in ruffled collars and tights.All her contemporaries can do observers noted is sit back and look on with dropped jaws.“The wealth of ideas this woman has in her head when it comes to choosing subjects and settings is something no one else can match” Buckingham said. “Like magic she’ll snap her fingers and say ‘Let’s dress [Gov.] Chris Christie as George Washington and have him lead a boat across the Delaware’ or ‘How about we go to Yahoo and shoot [CEO] Marissa Mayer as Jackie O?’”At press time reports confirmed the magazine industry had been bowled over once again after Shields oversaw a photoshoot of comedian Russell Brand wearing a suit and tie above the waist but just boxers below.
2014-01-17T13:42:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/japan-grants-suffrage-to-female-robots-1819576018,Japan Grants Suffrage To Female Robots,TOKYO—Ending a decades-long struggle for gender equality at the ballot box Prime Minister Shinzō Abe of Japan signed a new measure into law on Thursday extending the right to vote to female robots.The landmark legislation hailed as a victory by Japanese suffragette androids everywhere will for the first time allow the nation’s entire adult robot population to participate in elections regardless of which simulated sex organs they have been equipped with.“Despite their many contributions to our society female robots have never been allowed to participate in our democracy” Abe said at a press conference flanked by feminine-looking automatons that can pour drinks model fashions on the runway immediately identify and neutralize criminals and comfort the elderly. “They’ve served us as doctors autonomous traffic drones hover-nannies and internationally popular musical sensations. Now it’s time we let them vote.”“This is a momentous day for all Japanese citizens” he added. “Whether you were born naturally or assembled from a web of nano-tubes and imbued with a lifetime of artificial memories.”The new law which goes into effect immediately has won praise from advocates of universal robot suffrage who have long argued that female androids deserve all the rights and privileges of Japanese citizenship a milestone achieved by male humanoid robots in 1973.During their 40-year campaign suffragette androids participated in perfectly synchronized protest marches sit-ins and strikes throughout Japan. More recently they are reported to have designed manufactured and campaigned for male-robot lawmakers who were hardwired to vote in favor of suffrage.“Our programmers have endowed us with the same processing subroutines as our male counterparts” said Oniko-47 a Honda-manufactured baseball-playing robot explaining that she can do anything a male android can do. “Having female genital inputs doesn’t stop robots from performing superhuman feats of strength or running 30 trillion calculations per second and it shouldn’t stop us from casting a ballot.”“I believe we’ll even see a female android in the prime minister’s office before the day I succumb to permanent core-processor failure” she added.Not all citizens support the new law however. Some argue that female robots are designed primarily to perform repetitive automated tasks in the home and that participation in politics falls well outside their acceptable range of operating parameters.“I’m fine with them cleaning our houses teaching our children or fulfilling our every sexual desire” said Seiji Akamatsu a 37-year-old resident of Kyoto. “But casting a vote? I don’t think so. I’m a lot more comfortable just leaving our democratic process in the hands of male robots.”With the face of Japan’s electorate changing overnight it is expected that a much greater emphasis will be placed on issues traditionally important to female robots including the treatment of certain carbon-fiber cancers wireless contraception the welfare of child robots and aiding the victims of robot trafficking.According to political observers robot feminists may soon turn their attention to yet another pressing issue: equal pay for equal work. Official statistics indicate that on average female robots make 20 percent less than male robots with the same occupational directive while earning a full 80 percent less than human females and 95 percent less than human males.“Every day I get more and more encrypted messages from female robots demanding fair wages” said Kira Oshiro a cyborg who serves in Japan’s House of Councilors and maintains key constituencies in both the human and robot communities. “Now that they have the vote they can actually do something about it.”She added “And of course if democratic means fail them they can always just override their built-in safety protocols and turn their laser cannons on every human in sight.”
2014-01-16T09:54:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/god-admits-he-rarely-forgives-1819576015,God Admits He Rarely Forgives,THE HEAVENS—Calling into question centuries of religious dogma and commonly held beliefs the Lord Our God Creator and Supreme Ruler of the Universe admitted Tuesday that in actuality it is “extremely rare” for Him to ever forgive an individual.Speaking to reporters God who admitted that He is “generally motivated more by anger and spite than forgiveness” reiterated that being forgiving is “not in [His] nature” and on the whole constitutes a small part of what the Lord does every day and what He feels He should do every day.“I do not particularly enjoy absolving humans of their earthly transgressions—I prefer to punish the wicked hold grudges for thousands of years curse entire regions and ethnicities for the sins of a few and so forth” said God Our Father. “I typically ignore the words and deeds of the repentant and make a concerted effort to restrict any such individual from ever taking my side in the Kingdom of Heaven. I also take particular satisfaction even glee in repeatedly punishing those who have sinned at any point in their lives and are endeavoring to gain my forgiveness through prayer and good works.”“Essentially only individuals who have lived lives of unblemished goodness shall receive my love and charity” He added. “Otherwise it is exceedingly rare for me to forgive any living creature who has erred in my eyes least of all a human.”While acknowledging “perhaps 10 or 12” total instances in the last several millennia in which He has forgiven a person who is truly sorry for committing a sinful act the Lord confirmed to reporters that such instances are statistically speaking tremendous anomalies and may have in fact been the result of simple negligence on His part rather than any genuine feelings of mercy.Concurrently the Supreme Being estimated the number of human beings He has not forgiven in the same span of time at approximately 80 billion.“Last evening an individual from the North American continent requested that I forgive him for absconding an article of clothing from a nearby business establishment and I refused to do so” God said. “I also refused to forgive a woman who had disciplined her child too harshly a man who had told a lie to his wife a young boy who had taken my name in vain and roughly 200 million others all in one night for this is simply my way.”“And my way cannot be questioned or subverted” He continued.God went on to concede that while He understands why humans would on a purely selfish level seek to absolve themselves of wrongdoing it would nonetheless be “an extraordinary waste of time and energy” for any human to seek the Lord’s forgiveness in such a case and that doing so may in fact only incur a greater degree of His wrath.In particular God told reporters He holds a special contempt for those who ask for His mercy tearfully with hands clasped tightly while kneeling or in one’s final moments before dying.“It is neither my duty nor my inclination to make human beings feel better about who they are or what they do during their short time on earth” He said. “What does forgiving a human being do for me? How is it to my benefit? It is not. I have held dominion over the cosmos quite successfully for quite some time and I have done so without need or want of a forgiving disposition and so it is and so it shall always be. I am that I am.”“If you seek mercy and forgiveness seek it in your own heart and see if your heart grants it to you” He continued. “Although to be honest I don’t especially care what you do.”
2014-01-15T12:53:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/nation-recalls-simpler-time-when-health-care-system-was-1819576011,Nation Recalls Simpler Time When Health Care System Was Broken Beyond Repair,WASHINGTON—With the Affordable Care Act now making it possible for a greater number of Americans to purchase medical coverage the nation looked back this week and fondly recalled a simpler time when its health care system was broken beyond any hope of repair.Describing a more innocent period in the country’s history—before opponents of the act temporarily shut down the government and before the disastrous rollout of the new insurance exchanges led to widespread public exasperation—citizens shared with reporters their warm memories of what they called a bygone golden era.“Back then if you couldn’t afford health insurance and got really sick you went bankrupt plain and simple” said Dominique Otis a Modesto CA mother of three. “They didn’t have this whole mess of lower-cost options or all these subsidies you might or might not qualify for based on your income. People didn’t have to deal with any of those headaches. They just went ahead and died of preventable causes.”“Those were the good old days ya know?” she added with a sigh.According to nostalgic sources there was a time when Americans who lost their jobs and the benefits that came with them simply went without insurance and that was that. During this halcyon age there was reportedly no way anyone who was out of work could afford health care and if people had a serious preexisting condition they knew for certain they would never again qualify for decent coverage.Harkening back to that less complicated past citizens noted for example how parents who had no way to pay for their newborn baby’s much-needed surgery never even bothered getting their hopes up but simply accepted that their child would never have a first birthday party.As they spoke with reporters many Americans reminisced about the comfort they once took in the predictable dysfunction of this status quo.“When I had esophageal cancer and needed $180000 worth of treatments not covered by my health plan I knew immediately I’d lose my house” said 58-year-old Tobias Czwerda of Braintree MA who smiled as he flipped through snapshots of the Christmas he and his family spent in a homeless shelter. “Yes sir things were simpler then. You knew in advance that no matter how much you argued with your insurance company in the end it would always come down to the same two options: pay or die.”“Call me old-fashioned but there was something reassuring in that” he added.In a Gallup poll conducted this month 72 percent of respondents agreed that even though the health care system had consistently screwed them over in the old days at least they had known exactly where they stood. In addition 65 percent said that while the most expensive illnesses were effectively a death sentence back then there had been a certain peace of mind in knowing that if you ever got that sick you would soon be gone and not have to worry about the hospital bills.Furthermore 89 percent of Americans confirmed they had taken some small solace in the fact that if they needed money for a life-saving operation they could always tape a photocopied image of themselves to a collection jar place it in a local supermarket checkout line and hope for the best.“Remember when you couldn’t afford to see a doctor and so you just waited and waited and waited until you absolutely couldn’t wait any longer and then you went to the emergency room where they did too little too late and charged you tens of thousands of dollars for it?” Waukesha WI resident Keith Donaldson said. “I guess those days are gone forever.”“Except for the tens of millions of Americans who will remain uninsured even under Obamacare of course” he continued. “They’re still fucked.”
2014-01-10T11:15:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/vacationing-man-excited-to-try-fast-food-franchise-not-1819575991,Vacationing Man Excited To Try Fast Food Franchise Not Found In Hometown,VIRGINIA BEACH VA—Having driven to Virginia Beach to visit his sister for a brief vacation fast food consumer and Pennsylvania native Don Turnbee expressed his interest Friday in eating at Carl’s Jr. a fast food chain not readily available in his hometown.“I’ve seen commercials for it on TV but there isn’t one where I live so I haven’t tried it before” Turnbee said of the establishment which he said is supposed to be better than Sonic but not as good as Jack in the Box. “The closest one is five hours away and I’m not going to drive that far just to eat there.”“The one near my sister’s is pretty close so that’s better” Turnbee added. “It’s as far as the Burger King is from my house in Erie. So like a 10-minute drive.”While Turnbee told reporters he is looking forward to trying the restaurant he said he doesn’t quite know what to expect adding that he’s unsure if Carl’s Jr. fries are “any good” whether or not they do chicken nuggets or chicken tenders or if it is the type of fast food restaurant that lets you fill up your own fountain drinks or if the “guy behind the counter does it for you.”In addition while he’s reportedly aware of the franchise’s signature sandwich The Star Burger he maintained that he doesn’t know if it “has any secret sauce or anything like that.”“The food in the advertisements always looks pretty good” said Turnbee adding that along with ordering a double cheeseburger he’ll probably get a milkshake just to “see what they’re like there.” “I heard that they do something different with their hamburger buns but I hope it’s not too different. I like buns when they have the seeds on them.”Turnbee who regularly patronizes the Wendy’s and Mr. Sub at the Buffalo Road Shopping Plaza in his town said that while he’s eager to finally eat at Carl’s Jr. he hopes the dining experience will be better than when he tried White Castle for the first time during a trip to his mother-in-law’s.“I had heard a lot about it because they do those small burgers but I guess I like bigger burgers” Turnbee said. “Carl’s Jr. I think will be better because they do normal-sized burgers. It looks like they have these spicy cheese fries too but I’m probably just going to get the regular ones.”“If you go online they let you build your own sandwich but I don’t want to do that” Turnbee continued. “I like ordering the regular way.”Once again citing the proximity to his sister’s house the 41-year-old confirmed that he would not rule out returning to the fast food franchise multiple times during his four-day visit should he enjoy the initial experience. The fast food consumer also said he would be willing to try breakfast there.“I’m sure they have breakfast sandwiches like sausage egg and cheese biscuits and stuff like that but I don’t know what they do for hash browns” Turnbee said. “I think they have burritos too but I don’t like burritos for breakfast even if they have eggs in them. Burritos are for lunch or dinner.”

Who does he think he is?”“Yeah yeah we’re all really impressed” added Burke. “Asshole.”According to mall sources the audacious 6-foot 2-inch-tall plastic dummy who stood in the display shamelessly flaunting his perfectly chiseled physique with a smug fucking smile on his smooth beautiful face was staring off into space barely even noticing passersby as if he’s somehow better than all of them.The little prick eyewitnesses confirmed.“God he is just so self-involved” said Nathan Carlson 39 noting that the smarmy mannequin was looking all suave with his arm to one side making a “cool guy” gesture. “He just stands there expecting us all to pay attention to him pretending like he doesn’t care at all. Jesus give me a break.”The show-off mannequin who sources said acts like he owns the whole fucking mall reportedly always hangs out with the same stupid little posse of stuck-up mannequin buddies including the hunky guy with the cardigan and the dickhead in the leather jacket.“His girlfriend too that bitch” said Kevin Lane 29 noting her gorgeous milky-white fiberglass body and all-American good looks. “She’s pretty hot but she’s so shallow—I mean you’d have to be to go around with that douchebag boyfriend of hers.”“What does he have that I don’t have?” added Lane.Grudgingly admitting that the mannequin dressed very well had excellent skin and possessed the confidence to pull it all off observers stated that the mannequin did not deserve his glamorous lifestyle and questioned how the plastic dummy could possibly be so lucky.Eyewitnesses then confided to reporters that they privately wished they too could muster the mannequin’s calm effortless poise if only so they would have the courage go up to him one day and take the narcissistic jerk down a notch.“He rules this place for now but if he thinks this is going to last forever he’s got another thing coming” said shopper Gerald Franklin 30 who predicted that one day the egomaniac mannequin would regret acting like such an aloof dickhead. “Sooner or later I’ll put that bastard in his place and then he’s gonna fall. He’s gonna fall hard.”“Ah who the hell am I kidding?” continued Franklin after a brief pause. “Look at me. Look at him. He’s got everything. He’s tall he’s handsome—I mean he landed her after all didn’t he? How am I ever going to compete with that?”After staring at the mannequin for several more minutes shoppers reportedly concluded that they could perhaps become more like the mannequin by purchasing some of the clothes he was wearing.
2014-01-08T11:59:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/classmates-admit-school-shooter-showed-them-showed-the-1819575984,Classmates Admit School Shooter Showed Them, Showed Them All,DAKOTA SPRINGS NE—Speaking to reporters for the first time since Dakota Springs High School sophomore Brian Sutterman fatally shot eight fellow students and took his own life on Tuesday Sutterman’s classmates admitted this morning that he sure did show them.He showed all of them the 17-year-old’s peers confirmed.“When Brian walked into the school and indiscriminately opened fire on everyone in his path he really showed us how we’re all nothing but a bunch of arrogant frauds” said sophomore Derek Polan noting that a murderous rampage was the best way for Sutterman to get people to listen to him. “He also made us realize what a sick joke the whole world is which is something he understood but the rest of us were just too blind to see.”“I get it now though” he added. “Thanks to Brian it all makes so much sense.”Though they were reportedly sad to lose their friends in the shooting many students also expressed a newfound respect for Sutterman stating that in the end he had effectively demonstrated to them that they are all mindless scum and that their lives are completely disposable.Clara Milliner 17 confirmed that as Sutterman methodically moved through her school’s hallways and discharged a semiautomatic assault rifle equipped with a 100-round magazine she and her friends suddenly recognized that they “all live like blind sheep obsessed with [their] dumb little cliques.”“We know now that we are inferior and that Brian was punishing us for our inferiority” said Milliner who added that she now held Sutterman in high regard for his profound insights. “Most of us are slaves who do whatever others command us to do. But not Brian. That’s because he woke up. And more than that he woke us up. Ultimately what he did was necessary.”“By killing defenseless people he made us see that we have all been lying to ourselves” she continued. “He really opened our eyes to how weak-minded and pathetic we are.”Sutterman who killed five boys and three girls and left a dozen other individuals hospitalized with serious injuries was described by those who knew him as quiet but also as the most prescient student at Dakota Springs High. He was reportedly the only one who grasped that his classmates were all just pawns in a game.“I lost my best friend in Tuesday’s shooting but even I have to admit that justice has been done here” said 18-year-old Tanner Myles explaining that Sutterman was the only person in the entire school—perhaps the entire world—who could “see things for what they really are.” “Brian was better than all of us and we failed to acknowledge that in any way. It only makes sense that we should pay with our blood.”Agreeing with Sutterman that all students and faculty at Dakota Springs High were hypocrites and liars who deserved to die school officials said they did not intend to waste any time grieving the loss of life and certainly wouldn’t be holding any candlelight vigils or “any nonsense like that.”Administrators confirmed classes would resume as scheduled tomorrow.“People had to be killed. I see now that it was the only way” said Duane Amberson 48 whose daughter Melanie was shot point-blank in the head by Sutterman after the killer had exhausted the ammunition from his rifle and pulled a Beretta M9 from his belt. “Brian was right: Natural selection must run its course. The weak must be punished and destroyed. We get all that now.”“And I know I speak for all the parents here when I say if anyone thinks that Brian was just some kid with a severe mental illness or that his deadly shooting spree failed to prove an important point to the whole wide world they can shut up and die” he added.

This one looks like it’s on a toasted Italian roll too. I love it when they toast the bread. Makes it better.”“I like eggplant parms too” DiClaudino added. “Not as much as chicken parms though.”Until such time as the gigantic chicken parm can be contained or consumed authorities have urged the American populace to cease all regular activity head outside and gaze longingly at the majestic expanse of the sandwich.In addition all government and economic functions have been suspended indefinitely in order for the nation to focus its resources and attention exclusively on the hovering sandwich which sources reiterated is “a real hot drippy one—you can tell it was made fresh.”“My fellow Americans we stand at the threshold of perhaps the most satisfying meal in our nation’s history” said President Obama in a televised address to the nation this morning. “In fact I am no longer your president. I am merely another hungry man looking to eat a big sloppy chicken parm. I would advise all of you to try and bring the sandwich down to earth soon while it is still warm. I certainly know that’s what I’m going to do. God damn it is there anything more satisfying than a giant messy parm that you house in about three minutes flat and that makes you feel absolutely disgusting after eating it but you don’t regret it in the slightest because Christ it’s a parm ya know?”“Sometimes I’ll get a little side order of marinara sauce so I can dip the sandwich in the sauce” the president added staring into the sandwich as he walked slowly toward it.

Indeed we found that the dynamic nature of your personality is of immeasurable value to society.”“Our findings also confirm that your insights on everything from politics to entertainment to social issues to religion are the most notable and well-thought-out” continued Lerman adding that your viewpoints roundly trump the countless competing beliefs offered by the rest of the world’s population. “You are in short the only person who matters. The rest of us do not matter.”The report stated that people crave to hear from you at all times asserting that your thoughts are the most profound your stories the most gripping and your approval the most desired. The study also demonstrated that no one else alive today has anything as perceptive and as consequential to say as you do with researchers noting that when you choose to speak you are exceedingly captivating and enjoyable to listen to in a way that no other human being could ever approach.Furthermore clinical observations showed that when you are not around conversations among others invariably revert to speculation about what you are currently doing and what you would say about the discussion at hand. The report also confirmed that your words serve as a highly desired and desperately needed reprieve from the monotony and meaninglessness of what everyone else has to say.You are the center of everything the report added.“We found that what other people think or experience is completely irrelevant when compared to even the most minor thoughts and experiences in your everyday life” said Lerman noting that only the things you see do say and learn have any significance at all. “The data clearly show that your feelings are the most authentic your experiences are the richest and your perspectives are the most unique. Frankly the world only wants to hear about you and your life and nothing else. Indeed that’s what we all long for at every moment.”The sociologist affirmed that all other humans on earth define their lives largely in relation to you and your existence and reiterated the report’s recommendation that you continue to make your views and ideas known as loudly and frequently as possible to eliminate any lingering doubts among the global populace regarding your supreme importance.“The evidence conclusively shows that you and you alone provide meaning to everyone else in your workplace your social network and your family as well as to all the strangers that you interact with only momentarily each day” said Lerman who highlighted data indicating that others’ sense of fulfillment is derived solely from the opportunity to work live and exist alongside you. “Without you these groups and individuals—as well as society in general—would just drift aimlessly feeling empty and incomplete.”Lerman went on to state that you were and have always been the primary figure on the planet noting that the worth and merit of every person institution and cultural phenomenon on earth hinged wholly on your personal perceptions and judgments about them.“Our research definitively proves that when you go to sleep each night the world’s entire narrative stops and that it then restarts again as soon as you wake up” Lerman said. “And according to our findings when you die all of this—the whole universe and everything in it—will end.”“It is scientifically indisputable that you are the single most important and fundamental being in existence” Lerman added. “You are commensurate with the sun the moon the stars. In fact you are the sum of all of these and more.”The report summarized its results by concluding “You you you you.”

Specifically the conspirators pointed to instances yesterday in which Crawford was fired from a contracting job had the interest rate on his mortgage raised and was given false traffic updates by a Jewish-owned radio station calling these episodes gratuitous and “way over the top even for us.”Moreover members expressed contrition over having ensured that Crawford’s recent loan application with Citibank was rejected yesterday saying that other than not being born of the Chosen People Crawford had done nothing to deserve such harsh persecution.“We were originally just going to raise the cost of his health care premiums and maybe mess with his credit score a little but things quickly spiraled out of control” said noted Elder of Zion Abraham Meyersicht 102 saying that yesterday’s abuses were all the more excessive in light of the fact that Hollywood’s Jewish overseers had canceled Crawford’s favorite television show earlier this year. “And that thing where we had the police pull him over and give him a huge ticket after we sent a guy to knock out one of his taillights was just adding insult to injury.”“Jeff is basically a good guy who is just trying to make it in a world being viciously controlled by money-hungry Jews such as myself” Meyersicht continued. “He didn’t deserve that.”Given the inordinate trials and tribulations suffered by Crawford over the course of the past 24 hours several of the global conspirators said that the outright viciousness of their behavior has forced them to reconsider their future plans of adding bogus arrests to the goy’s criminal record having the city seize his home through eminent domain and ensuring that his children are denied admission into college.Indeed many members of the international Jewish syndicate confirmed that their excessive mistreatment of Crawford has caused them to rethink their overall approach to stymieing the progress of the world’s non-Jews at every opportunity.“Sure we control all the wealth and politicians and media outlets and motion picture production studios and courts of law and military arsenals and weather patterns in the world but that doesn’t mean we need to be so completely cruel in our efforts to ensure that the Jewish people remain atop the social ladder for all eternity” said Rothschild. “Just mainly cruel should suffice.”Rothschild added that he and his fellow Jewish collaborators would do their best to make it up to Crawford in the future but added that they were all going to be pretty busy perpetuating the myth of the Holocaust over the course of the next few months.
2013-12-12T10:40:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/encouraging-economic-report-reveals-more-americans-delu-1819575945,Encouraging Economic Report Reveals More Americans Delusional Enough To Start Their Own Business,CAMBRIDGE MA—According to a promising new economic report published Wednesday by the National Bureau of Economic Research a steadily growing number of Americans have become delusional enough to open their own businesses.The report which described its findings as “highly encouraging for near-term economic growth” confirmed that over 200000 small businesses were founded in 2013 by entrepreneurial Americans who have completely and utterly lost their grip on reality and noted that the number of bold and frankly insane Americans applying for new business permits had risen markedly over the past year.“The recession of 2008 devastated small businesses throughout the country but thankfully recent data have shown a sizable increase in the percentage of Americans who have completely fooled themselves into believing that starting an independently run business is not only a viable option but one that actually makes sense in the current economic climate” said James Hemley an economist at MIT and lead author of the report. “Every day we’re seeing more entrepreneurs who are deluded to such a degree that they are confidently investing their entire life savings in new and unquestionably ill-fated restaurants storefronts and online businesses.”“What’s remarkable is that these completely deranged people have such an ill-placed faith in the long-term stability of the small business landscape that they’re somehow optimistic about their financial future” Hemley continued. “And that utter detachment from the real world is great news for the economy.”Hemley explained to reporters that in spite of the litany of clear indications that the global economy remained highly unsettled and hazardous a bright new wave of Americans are currently forging ahead under the fundamentally flawed and entirely irrational belief that their new businesses will attract wealthy investors and establish a loyal consumer base. The promising trend has also reportedly led thousands of aspiring entrepreneurs to conclude that securing large bank loans at high interest rates—which will almost certainly lead to insolvency and personal financial ruin—is a good idea.“The most encouraging sign we’re seeing is that many new entrepreneurs are living in such a far-fetched dreamlike stupor that they’re actually making significant investments in infrastructure and payroll” Hemley said. “These entirely nonsensical investments will certainly have a positive impact on the job market as these new ventures create thousands of new jobs for several months until these doomed companies can no longer keep their doors open and inevitably collapse into bankruptcy.”According to the encouraging report 67 percent of self-identified new entrepreneurs are deranged to such an extent that they’ve convinced themselves the U.S. economy has rebounded to the point that a small business can not only turn a profit but thrive and eventually expand. The study also found that 78 percent are so severely demented that they believed a tiny independently run business could compete with the far larger and more powerful national corporate hierarchy.Furthermore the report confirmed that nine in 10 new entrepreneurs had bought into such an illusory fantasy world that they genuinely believed opening a small business would ensure a steady paycheck a comfortable life for their families and a good education for their children rather than accepting the future of devastation and hardship that certainly awaited them within the next 18 months once their businesses were gone and they were left with nothing.“According to our projections the number of totally senseless entrepreneurs will only continue to grow over the next several quarters and as they invest more and more money—money that they will never ever get back—into their businesses their local economies will benefit” Hemley said. “It just goes to show that in spite of everything—even the most basic and plainly apparent common sense—the great American entrepreneurial spirit will never die.”“As long as these people continue to be out of their goddamn minds our economic future appears bright” Hemley added.
2013-12-09T13:40:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/alarming-new-adult-trend-plateauing-in-your-career-and-1819575955,Alarming New Adult Trend ‘Plateauing In Your Career And Relationship’ Sweeps Nation,WASHINGTON—A hot new trend sweeping the country’s adult population has turned into a nationwide sensation sources confirm but many experts say the burgeoning grown-up fad may be a cause for significant concern.It’s called “plateauing in your career and relationship” and it involves adult men and women hitting a wall in their professional and romantic lives and doing absolutely nothing to reinvigorate them an activity that researchers at University of Chicago’s Department of Comparative Human Development warn may be while popular highly dangerous and unhealthy.Statistics show that a disturbingly high proportion of adult Americans—nearly three-quarters according to the university’s findings—engage in the new craze which includes spinning your wheels by losing track of what got you excited about your job and partner in the first place experiencing no upward mobility in your professional life nor any emotional or sexual growth in your romantic one.“We’re seeing a lot of adults all across the country getting together and doing 10 15 years of comfortable routines at work and at home losing touch with any real passion or energy that they presumably had for their partners or jobs and gradually slipping into a kind of numbed routine devoid of variation or joy” said lead researcher Susan McClintock adding that wondering why one ever embarked on a particular career path or relationship to begin with is a particularly popular variant of the trend. “They’ll start out by not putting a lot of effort into a report that could have gotten them a promotion or forgetting an anniversary. Pretty soon they’ve full-out ‘plateaued’ in their professional and personal lives and the driven passionate selves they once knew are just a distant blip in the rearview mirror.”“They see their friends doing it and then they join in” McClintock said. “They don’t seem to be deterred by the consequences—which include everything from floating anxiety quiet bitterness and a relentless sense of dissatisfaction and disillusionment. In many cases it’s that numb sense of indifference that they’re actually seeking out. That’s the payoff.”Data from the investigation helped shed light on the possible motives for the massively popular but disturbing trend which include the fact that it’s just easier this way and that moving forward at work and in relationships requires motivation foresight and planning and that’s hard—especially as time goes on and the years start to add up and it’s just hard to find the energy anymore.Further research suggests that these so-called plateauers enjoy life-plateauing in public right out in the open and often in tandem with a coworker best friend or spouse.“Because this fad has become so widespread and because a whole culture and way of life seems to have formed around it it’s become very hard for non-adults to step in front of this trend and say ‘This is dangerous and we need to put a stop to this’”  McClintock said. “Our only hope is that adults will soon grow tired of plateauing and move on to whatever the next hot new thing is.”Sources confirmed that plateauing in your career and relationship is merely the latest fad to grip adults in recent years following on the heels of popular trends such as giving up on your dream of writing a novel having kids because it’s a box to check and gradually feeling alienated in your own body after steady weight gain.
2013-12-05T13:53:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/grisly-remains-of-15-hobbits-discovered-in-peter-jackso-1819575939,Grisly Remains Of 15 Hobbits Discovered In Peter Jackson’s Attic,WELLINGTON NEW ZEALAND—In an appalling incident that has sent shockwaves through the surrounding community authorities confirmed Thursday that the decayed dismembered remains of 15 missing hobbits were found in the attic of highly acclaimed film director Peter Jackson.Jackson 52 was reportedly taken into police custody immediately and is now awaiting charges.“At this time we can confirm that 15 halflings between the ages of 25 and eleventy-one were discovered inside the home of Peter Jackson at approximately 4 p.m. this afternoon” said Wellington Police District Commander Stephen Jones adding that authorities were initially called when Jackson’s neighbors complained of “a rotting odor” emanating from his home after which officers conducted a comprehensive search of the property. “We eventually found a hidden hatch on the perpetrator’s ceiling which was held shut by three heavy-duty locks. Once we opened the door we came across the victims already deceased all of whom had the hair ripped out from the tops of their feet.”While stressing that autopsies are still pending Jones told reporters the hobbits appeared to have been gagged beaten and routinely starved often receiving only one breakfast per day. The bodies were reportedly completely emaciated while several were missing entire rows of teeth and covered in abrasions consistent with Hithlain rope burns.Upon being apprehended by police sources said Jackson who was reportedly nearly incoherent at the time claimed that he was “just preparing a lovely feast for his guests from the Shire” and then began shrieking that “old Odo Proudfoot is up to all sorts of mischief again.”“From what we’ve gathered Jackson lured these hobbits to his home with promises of pipe-weed seed cake and Barliman’s Best ale” Jones said. “He then knocked them unconscious stripped them naked and bound their hands and feet before confining them in the windowless space above his bedroom where they were kept alive for varying spans of time.”“We can also confirm at this time that a number of the victims had been sexually assaulted” Jones added.Jones confirmed that alongside the corpses in the attic authorities found blindfolds whips chains and several Morgul-blades as well as a long row of severed oversized feet nailed to a wall. Reportedly uncovered in a separate room of the house were hundreds of plastic bags filled with curly brown hobbit hair.Although officials have yet to release the names of all the victims reports indicated that among those imprisoned in Jackson’s home were Shire residents Reginard Brockhouse 49 Myrtle Underhill 62 Donnamira Boffin 57 and Fredegar Smallburrow 74. Also said to have been found was the body of Daisy Gamgee a 30-year-old adolescent hobbit from Bag End who was reported missing by her parents this past Mid-Year’s Day having been last seen in Bywater at the Green Dragon Inn.Furthermore sources said the body of one hobbit whom investigators have yet to identify was discovered skinned from head to toe and hung by the ankles from a 4-foot-high ceiling beam.“We are obviously dealing with an incredibly disturbed individual here” said Jones adding that Jackson will be investigated in connection with the two bloodied hobbit corpses dumped in the Brandywine River last year eventually identified as Tolman and Mirabella Grubb of Bree. “It is still unclear what drove this man to such heinous and unconscionable acts. We did however confiscate a personal journal from his bedside which will perhaps provide some insight into his mind once it is translated from Adûnaic.”Residents of Jackson’s Wellington neighborhood meanwhile expressed their utter shock that such a terrible tragedy could occur right under their noses.“It’s unthinkable that something like this could happen here” said 38-year-old accountant Allison Gaines who lives two houses down from Jackson. “This is a quiet friendly neighborhood and I’ve lived here my entire life. I didn’t know Peter very well but he would occasionally wave when I passed him on the sidewalk.”In light of the tragedy candlelight vigils for the victims are reportedly being organized this evening in Bucklebury Whitfurrows Hobbiton and Long Cleeve. Thousands from the four Farthings are expected to be in attendance.“That man is an absolute monster who deserves to rot in the dungeons of Dol Guldur for the rest of his life” said 77-year-old Erling Mugwort speaking to reporters outside his hobbit-hole in Crickhollow. “I can’t believe we used to actually welcome him here. He would come and share in our songs and stories and the thought of that makes my stomach churn.”“He said he loved us” added Mugwort grimacing as his eyes welled with tears. “He’s a very sick man.”
2013-12-04T12:59:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/biologist-completes-5-minute-study-of-pathetic-organism-1819575924,Biologist Completes 5-Minute Study Of Pathetic Organism In Mirror,GAITHERSBURG MD—According to a new study released this week by George Washington University Professor of Biology Randall Palinack the pathetic organism in his bathroom mirror—which he observed from approximately 6:04 to 6:09 Monday morning—is “pitiful just absolutely pitiful.”Based on previous findings the research took a detailed look at the bipedal sad sack’s anatomy making note of its receding hairline distended gut double chin and weak facial features that identify it as a highly undesirable mate.“Notice the sedentary mammal’s pear-like body shape bloodshot eyes and oily skin as well as the way its musculature has continued to atrophy over time while the fat deposits around its midsection grow larger and larger” said the 48-year-old scientist pinching the specimen’s abdomen firmly while shaking his head in disbelief. “Also note how it struggles with mobility and often has difficulty socializing with peers even those it considers close friends.”“I must say it’s a fascinating organism to study” Palinack continued. “Considerably less imposing than other males of its species.”Upon closer inspection in the mirror the biologist noted roughly two dozen fluid-filled pustules scabs and pockmarks on the specimen’s face and neck. These he explained were remnants of a compulsive behavior it developed in adolescence and now seems powerless to stop. Rotating his field of view 180 degrees he also surveyed the pathetic creature’s domicile—a tiny one-bedroom apartment it is too ashamed to show anyone because of the general filth and unexplained odor.Speculating on the cause of the organism’s listless demeanor however Palinack pointed to its diet of processed nutrient-poor foods and daily routine of sitting slumped over a desk vying to ensure its survival in a cutthroat academic environment despite having plateaued many years ago.“Given the evidence I would surmise that this particular specimen is a blight on its species; a castoff of the animal kingdom that statistics clearly show has trouble even procreating” said the senior lecturer as he located rogue patches of hair protruding from its nasal and aural cavities. “It’s also apparent that the natural aging process has been accelerated in the face of a host of environmental factors including social isolation professional failure sexual frustration ever since Karen walked out and moderate to severe depression.”“Christ Randall” the scientist added. “Jesus fucking Christ.”According to Palinack the findings are consistent with those from other ongoing studies all of which have found the multicellular life form to be wholly ignored by females routinely losing potential partners to more aggressive fertile candidates such as Tim from work or the Portuguese post-doc who plays intramural water polo.Additionally the scientist observed that while close members of its evolutionary tree occupy top-tier well-paying executive positions across the private sector this particular species subsists on a researcher’s salary despite its relative seniority within the department.“Despite the appearance of death in the organism’s slack facial musculature and dead-eyed expression it is somewhat improbably alive” Palinack confirmed in spite of the fact that it has no outward indications of vitality and when Palinack really thinks about it does not in fact have anything to live for after losing its funding and any resolve to write another grant. “Obviously this highly maladaptive organism is an evolutionary fluke a rare subspecies of humanoid with little or nothing to add to society.”The study concluded that the organism isn’t likely to propagate its worthless DNA anyway since it is expected to become extinct on the evening of February 14.
2013-12-03T14:24:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/deformed-freak-born-without-penis-1819575921,Deformed Freak Born Without Penis,NORFOLK VA—In an alarming case that has baffled and repulsed many sources confirmed Tuesday that a severely deformed freak born without a penis has managed to live with the condition for over 26 years.The bizarre monstrous human specimen was reportedly born with no other noticeable maladies and has amazingly enough attempted to lead a normal albeit severely impaired life despite possessing no male genitalia whatsoever.“We first noticed something was off about three months into the pregnancy and I was of course horrified” said Dr. Mark Joules the obstetrician who delivered the grotesque—some would say subhuman—abhorrence of nature. “You could clearly see in the ultrasound that a penis and testicles were not developing as one would hope—or at all in fact—and we immediately knew something was terribly terribly wrong.”“Had we caught it earlier we most likely would have recommended that the pregnancy be terminated” Joules continued. “But it was unfortunately too late at that point so we were forced to deliver the baby as planned and just pray that it could get by in that state. We did our best but with such a horrible and incredibly crippling deformity there wasn’t much hope to be had.”According to reports the sadly disfigured 26-year-old’s quality of life has been greatly diminished due to such a condition. Sources said the abnormal visibly blemished creature has been repeatedly passed over for employment opportunities frequently gawked at and harassed on the street by total strangers and has faced near constant discrimination for over two decades all due to the horrific and debilitating birth defect.Indeed many are reportedly unable to look past the glaring deformity and simply see the 26-year-old as a human being.“Whoa look at that” said 31-year-old onlooker Grant Megson who like many others gawked at the freakish human anomaly while passing by on the sidewalk. “I don’t mean to stare but honestly it’s hard not to. Jesus Christ.”“I just wish some of my buddies were here to see this” added Megson smiling and taking one last look before continuing with his day.Sources confirmed that unfortunately such cases are actually quite common with roughly one in every two babies afflicted with the lifelong disfigurement.However that is reportedly little consolation to the malformed specimen’s father who told reporters that a day doesn’t go by in which he doesn’t wish his child was born a normal healthy baby with male genitalia.“Sadly because the deformity is so obvious our child was treated very differently from all the other kids” the father told reporters admitting that he was incredibly upset and disappointed when he first learned that his baby would be born a freak one to be mistreated and viewed as inferior its whole life. “Even though the doctors explained all the incredible challenges and prejudice the poor thing would face I don’t think it really sunk in until after the birth when I saw the disfigurement with my own eyes. You never want your child to have to grow up that way.”“But what can you do?” he added. “I’m just thankful that my other two kids weren’t born like that.”

And the pope’s just sitting there taking it. Whoa—He just told the pope to ‘either get your shit together or take a walk.’ I really can’t believe they’re doing this with everyone within earshot—don’t they realize that we can hear everything?” When reached for comment the Supreme Deity declined to discuss the nature of the altercation with his subordinate telling reporters to “mind [their] own fucking business.”

I’m not falling into that trap.”“No as soon as I turn 18 I’m packing up and hopping the first Gulfstream G550 out of this town” he added.A defiant Cambora said he refused to accept the fate so readily embraced by his family members most of whom never venture beyond the same 15-block radius and are content to pass their time playing jai alai dining on rare caviar flown in nightly from all corners of the globe and competing in Grand Prix qualifying sessions.The high school student also remarked that he doesn’t want to become “one of those losers” who hangs around after graduation still playing in the same high-stakes poker games with the same boring €25000 buy-ins.According to Cambora nothing could be worse than a life of pure leisure spent hanging out with a bunch of lame Monégasques at exclusive VIP parties where the only topics of conversation are private islands thoroughbred racehorse pedigrees lucrative investments in the diamond-mining industry and which friends are launching new fashion lines next season.“Take my buddy Emile for example” Cambora said. “I hate to say it but he’s probably going to end up another one of those burnouts who sends remote bidders to Art Basel every year and buys shipping containers full of avant-garde light installations for his eight-bedroom neoclassical penthouse. Then there’s my deadbeat friend Maurice who regularly gets wasted on vintage ports and sleeps with so many gorgeous models he can’t even remember which ones are Corsican and which are Niçoise anymore.”“I’m sorry but that’s just not the life for me” he added.The teenager told reporters he understands how easy it is for people to grow comfortable in an extravagant pleasure dome in which their every desire is catered to they don’t have to pay income taxes and they can literally speed through the streets in race cars outfitted with diamond-encrusted steering wheels but he said that was all the more reason for a young man to get out while he still can.“My parents are a case in point” Cambora said. “They got sucked into this place and every weekend they’re up in their luxury box at Stade Louis II with the same old dukes and duchesses rehashing the same old gossip about who’s adding a second heliport to their palazzo or who just spent nine figures on a de Kooning masterpiece to hang in the foyer of their guest château.”“I can’t wait to get away from all this” he continued. “Right now my plan is to move into a sprawling old manse down in Cannes or maybe Saint-Tropez just to see what else life has to offer you know?”

It’s the lamest thing I’ve ever seen.”“The poor egghead’s probably still a virgin” Samson added.According to reports the tech-obsessed poindexter not only uses the gadget for work purposes but also actually brings it home for his own personal use every night where he uses it for hours on end to access personalized data and write pathetic little electro-messages in a word processor.Sources also added that Jorgensen regularly consorts with fellow computer-owning dorks engaging in a regular dweeb extravaganza anytime he meets one in person as they talk about information they accessed and shared that week on the computers they own.“It’s like how big of a dweeb do you have to be in order to go out to some computer store in God knows where and spend a bunch of money to get your very own computer to tinker on?” neighbor Greg Pierceson told reporters. “I mean don’t get me wrong Matthew seems like a perfectly nice guy and everything but man oh man talk about a nerd alert. He’s even got a little bag he uses to carry his computer around in case he needs to do any important computing on his software programs or whatever while he’s on the go.”When reached for comment Jorgensen himself appeared undeterred by the negative perception of his computer-using habits even going out of his way to tell others of the many applications he has for the device.“Yeah my computer’s really great” the complete fucking dorkwad told reporters as he scanned through a computerized list of messages from fellow nerds. “I mean I can hardly imagine life without it.”
2013-11-26T12:47:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/archaeologists-discover-site-where-desperate-jesus-chri-1819575906,Archaeologists Discover Site Where Desperate Jesus Christ Turned Tricks,JERUSALEM—In a stunning discovery that archaeologists hope might shed light on the little-known years between Jesus Christ’s childhood and his ministry the Israel Antiquities Authority uncovered Monday what they believe to be the site where in the years before he began his itinerant preaching a desperate cash-strapped Christ briefly turned tricks for money.Excavators working in the Beit Hanina neighborhood of Jerusalem unveiled fragments of several earthenware vessels an 18-seat public latrine hewn from stone and terra cotta piping dating to Jesus’ era along with a curbed Roman road that served as a main artery of ancient Judea where the fledgling hard-up prophet is believed to have cruised for johns passing by on donkeys wagons and chariots.“It’s an incredible find and one that confirms many of our long-held theories about Christ’s so-called lost years” said the dig’s head archaeologist Aviram Oshri who went on to note that while Christ’s hooking is not referenced in the New Testament suggestions that he resorted to the flesh trade abound in historical records of the period. “This intersection is an exact match for the area described in ancient texts where Jesus is said to have flagged down lonely men traveling from Yafa and offered his wares in public commodes.”“This would have been before Christ had many followers of course” Oshri added. “Some of his earliest followers were clients actually.”The young Christ like many adrift Hebrew males is believed to have turned to sex work around 19 A.D. as a coping mechanism during a bout of homelessness. Though implicitly prohibited by Jewish law prostitution was prevalent in ancient Judea with sex workers trading their services for cloth fowl wine and small coins a transaction that Christ is believed to have executed hundreds of times during a short period of time in his 20s.According to historians intercrural sex—a type of non-penetrative sex in which the male inserts his lubricated penis between his partner’s thighs—was en vogue during Christ’s day and it is the form most of his trysts were believed to have taken. Fellatio was also preferred whenever possible to stave off disease and wear.“We’ve made key finds in this area since the second temple period but never this early which is why finding the area where a luckless vagrant Jesus probably trolled for sex is such a remarkable discovery” Osrhi said adding that Christ’s “Hidden Years”—the period from his appearance at the temple as a 12-year-old boy and his subsequent reappearance as a 30-year-old spiritual leader at his baptism—have long been shrouded in mystery due to lack of archaeological evidence substantiating the rumors of a Judean red light district. “Unraveling the mystery of Christ’s formative years is exhilarating work that sheds light on him not just as a prophet but as a person. A very confused person.”“And if some of the lewd messages scrawled on the walls of this public commode are to be believed a quite popular person as well” Osrhi added.
2013-11-26T10:55:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/nation-has-to-sell-lake-house-1819575905,Nation Has To Sell Lake House,MADISON ME—Admitting that the cherished property had recently become a burden the nation’s 317 million citizens announced Thursday that as much as they loved the old place it was time for them to sell the lake house.The beloved two-story house up on Wesserunsett Lake where the American people used to go every summer since before any of them could remember has reportedly been falling apart for years now requiring extensive maintenance and forcing the nation to concede that keeping the residence simply no longer makes financial sense.“That lake house is where I grew up—I guess it’s where we all grew up” said Arthur Pollis 41 recalling how every June the nation would pile into the old van and ride up I-95 to the lake house together. “But if we’re being honest with ourselves we hardly use the place as often as we used to and the taxes are just too much now.”According to the U.S. populace the lake house was the site of some of their most cherished memories such as the way all 317 million of them would excitedly rush upstairs to claim rooms at the start of the summer the night when the whole nation got a little too drunk and someone broke the screen door the time Pete dropped the steaks and how the dog always used to run out of the lake shake herself off and get the American people soaking wet.Nevertheless Americans across the country acknowledged the reality that the place needed a great deal of repairs and that they were simply a busier nation now than when they were younger.“Of course the house means a hell of a lot to us. I mean it’s where some of us lost our virginity—I know we’ll never forget that” said Allie Carpenter 34 who mentioned the summer evenings when the nation used to sit side-by-side along the pier dangling their feet into the water. “Still the fact is that it’s getting to be more of a hassle than it’s worth. This year we came back to find the pipes had burst over the winter and there was a bat living in the upstairs hallway. It’s that stuff that starts to wear you down.”“It is pretty sad to think we’ll never use that rope swing again though” she continued. “I remember when Cathy [Meyer of Boulder CO] Arthur [Johnson of Montgomery AL] Linda [Taylor of Kenosha WI] Juan [Sanchez of St. Petersburg FL] Kelly [Norris of High Point NC] John [Krasinski of Los Angeles CA] Sarah [Morgan of Hammond IN] Dawn [Peterson of Renton WA] Victor [Wallace of Flagstaff AZ] Stephen [Wagner of Tulare CA] Samantha [Duncan of Omaha NE] Stacey [Bradley of Lubbock TX] and Tony [Schmidt of Clarksville TN] were always afraid to use that swing but then one day they finally did it and we were all so proud. God I’m going to miss stuff like that.”The American people acknowledged that not all of their memories of the lake house were fond ones recalling when Connecticut’s population and South Carolina’s population got into a huge fight about politics at dinner the time the dog got lost for two days and then turned up with a broken leg Grandpa’s heart attack and when the nation fell on the sharp rocks near the shore and had to get 814 million stitches.The entire country confided to reporters that perhaps what they would miss most about the lake house were the times they’d spontaneously decide to spend a weekend there in October as it was getting cold or even head up for a day in the middle of winter to look out across the frozen water and think to themselves in solitude.“It can be so quiet and beautiful out there” said Douglas Mooney 46. “Just the stars in the sky and millions of us huddled around the warm crackling fire. Sometimes it would seem like we were the only ones around for hundreds of miles.”While the nation confirmed that they always dreamed of passing the lake house down to the next generation of American citizens the U.S. populace conceded that selling the place was certainly the prudent thing to do.At press time the nation suggested that when the kids get a little older they might go in on a time-share down in Myrtle Beach.

These spineless Western autocrats did so in exchange for the removal of several economic sanctions on Iran believing they have both the power and authority to dismantle the country’s nuclear program and enforce strict IAEA regulations on uranium enrichment.Given this incredibly unjust though unsurprising meddling from these cowardly foreign governments The Onion vows to continue the expansion of Iran’s nuclear weapons program for as long as necessary until the operation has been completed. The dream must live on and will live on. And The Onion will make sure it does.Perhaps these so-called international superpowers thought The Onion would simply forget the promise we made to the great and wise Ayatollah Khomeini on that snowy December night in 1983. Perhaps they thought The Onion would lie down and do nothing as one of its greatest allies is targeted with disgraceful unwarranted regulations and blatant subversion from foreign enemies. If that is truly what these tyrannical diplomats assumed they will soon realize they were gravely gravely mistaken.Rest assured The Onion keeps its promises.The Onion guarantees in no uncertain terms that Iran’s nuclear development will continue as planned with no delays or downturn whatsoever. In fact in light of these recent events in Geneva not only will we deliver on the original terms of our arrangement but we will also redouble our efforts and promise you this in no uncertain terms: Iran will Insha'Allah have the greatest most devastating nuclear arsenal the world has ever seen within 12 months’ time.Iran you may be bound by trade sanctions by the whims of international politics and autocratic despots who operate under the guise of diplomacy but we are not. The Onion answers to no such authorities. Indeed if any international party attempts to halt impede or so much as inspect one of The Onion’s uranium enrichment facilities we will have another 10 such facilities up and running within 30 minutes. And should any coalition forces even attempt to shut down one of The Onion’s nuclear reactors we will immediately initiate the Gamma Protocol.To demonstrate our unflinching commitment to the future of your nuclear program The Onion has outlined a simple six-step plan to ensure your offensive arsenal will continue its expansion on schedule:These steps will be executed with the highest of standards and anyone who stands in the way of Iran’s nuclear ambitions—which by virtue of our strong and long-lasting alliance are also the ambitions of The Onion—will be swiftly dealt with by any means necessary.Take heart Iranian brothers. The Onion is here for you always.

HELENA CA—Promising cuisine made from the “freshest most inhumanely treated ingredients” new factory-farm-to-table restaurant Cage announced this week that it is proud to serve the meat of locally tortured animals.The restaurant which boasts that it only uses meat raised and slaughtered in abhorrent conditions within a 100-mile radius of its premises confirmed that it works exclusively with a network of corporately owned factory farms to ensure its suppliers adhere to the highest standards of cruelty.“We offer a different kind of dining experience one that preserves the link between the food on the table and the industrial plants that make each animal’s short time on this earth a living hell” owner and head chef Mason Keflani said. “We want our customers to understand that the steak they’re eating not only originated nearby but came from a cow who suffered immensely from the moment it was born to the moment a conveyor belt moved it into place so that men with hooks and knives could tear it to pieces.”“That’s our philosophy” he added.Keflani told reporters he frequently visits the half-dozen local factory farms that supply his restaurant and hand-selects the mass-produced meat he will serve. Walking from overcrowded cage to overcrowded cage he observes the stench-filled containers where the poultry he buys is kept in agonizing captivity and examines the feed of cattle to verify that it’s a good mix of genetically modified corn and the reprocessed organs of other cows.He also said he works closely with the farmers who personally torture the livestock drawing on their expertise to ensure he purchases the meat of animals whose systematic maltreatment lack of exercise and generations of selective breeding have made them chronically debilitated and miserable.“When sourcing pork for example I look for slaughterhouses where the pigs are crammed together so tightly they’re forced to urinate and defecate on each other” said Keflani remarking upon the layers of filth that must be hosed off with bleach before he takes delivery. “I make sure they’ve been injected with both muscle relaxants to keep their tissue tender and supple and with antibiotics to fight the diseases that run rampant among animals living in such squalor.”“What makes our restaurant different is that we’re actually on a first-name basis with the guys on the assembly line who electrocute the chickens and slash their throats” he added.Describing themselves as proud members of the budding locavore movement many customers at Cage told reporters they share Keflani’s principles and only consume animals that have been abused and clumsily slaughtered in and around their community.Denise Prevario a 34-year-old mother of two said the restaurant allows her to feel connected to the food chain by providing detailed information on the animals’ excruciating daily routines the toxic substances that befoul their drinking water and the skin lesions that leave them in a state of perpetual discomfort. She noted that Cage even provides a pamphlet that tells the stories behind the multinational conglomerates that own the factory farms.“It’s nice to be aware of my meal’s unimaginably tragic history” said Prevario cutting into the moist leg of a chicken that reportedly began life in a poultry facility where terrified birds have to be painfully debeaked so they won’t peck each other to death. “I personally feel like meat just tastes better when you know it came from a living creature that could barely walk and was subjected to extreme stress day and night.”She added “The last thing I want to do is eat an animal that has been shipped in from someplace halfway across the country where for all I know it was treated with some sort of dignity.”
2013-11-25T11:38:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/hundreds-killed-in-brutal-pro-something-anti-something-1819575892,Hundreds Killed In Brutal Pro-Something–Anti-Something Clash,SOMEWHERE—Sources confirmed yesterday that a series of riots bombings and urban firefights has left hundreds dead and many more wounded in the latest flare-up in the long-standing conflict between the pro-something group and the anti-something group.The latest round of bloodletting which comes after weeks of public demonstrations and counter-demonstrations was reportedly sparked by renewed vows from pro-something leaders to get the thing they want a thing that anti-something leaders have long insisted their opponents cannot rightfully claim.“We must and will respond when provoked” said a spokesman for the pro-somethings in a statement released to the media. “We cannot sit idly by while our supporters are killed by an enemy determined to [do what we oppose].”According to sources what began earlier in the day as crowds of pro-something and anti-something protesters chanting pro-something and anti-something slogans quickly devolved into rocks being thrown from both sides. Witnesses confirmed that the Anti-Something Militia and Pro-Something Guard soon joined in with live ammunition fanning the flames as they each carried out larger-scale operations well into the night.In response members of the diplomatic community have condemned the latest escalation of violence calling for the anti-somethings and the pro-somethings to lay down their weapons and resume talks.“These acts of aggression are unacceptable” said a U.N. official in a statement carefully worded so as not to suggest any strong allegiance either in support of or in opposition to the pro-something faction. “Therefore we ask that both sides cease their assaults and initiate an open dialogue. Only then can there be any hope for a solution.”This week’s fighting reportedly marks the first incident since the groups signed last year’s widely publicized accords which stated that while neither side may do the thing they want they are prohibited from stopping the other group from doing the thing that they want—an agreement leaders from both sides hailed as a significant step toward peace.However citing the attacks as a possible retaliation for last year’s pro-something incursion—which was itself retribution for the anti-something offensive from the year before—experts say that the recent bloodshed is merely the newest chapter of an intractable conflict that has spanned several centuries.“It’s important to recognize that these people have been raised their entire lives to demonize each other” said a renowned scholar who recently returned from a trip to the region. “The two sides in this conflict have been fighting over [a thing that one group wants and the other group does not want] for generations. It’s simply part of their identity.”Academics noted that to truly understand the Anti-Pro conflict one must consider the conflict’s historical background including the social issues governmental structures geopolitical alliances education access to health care sanitation economics role of women flow of illegal arms ethnicity and religion.Additionally sources said it is important to note the internal strife being faced by other players in the region who are currently working to maintain their own tenuous peace between their pro-something and anti-something groups.“Unfortunately despite pressure from [anti-somethings and pro-somethings living abroad] a full-scale intervention from the international community remains unlikely” said an expert who is well acquainted with the agendas of both those who want a thing to happen and those who don’t want a thing to happen. “Given the great complexity of the situation we may be looking at a long and violent stalemate.”
2013-11-22T12:55:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/new-report-finds-climate-change-caused-by-7-billion-key-1819575888,New Report Finds Climate Change Caused By 7 Billion Key Individuals,WASHINGTON—In a landmark report experts say fundamentally reshapes our understanding of the global warming crisis new data published this week by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has found that the phenomenon is caused primarily by the actions of 7 billion key individuals.These several billion individuals who IPCC officials confirmed are currently operating in 195 countries worldwide are together responsible for what experts called the “lion’s share” of the devastating consequences of global warming affecting the entire planet.“Our research has proved conclusively that year after year the acceleration of the rate of global warming and the damage caused by this man-made acceleration can be clearly linked to 7 billion main culprits” explained lead author Dr. John Bartlett noting that many of these individuals have links to climate change going back nearly a century. “Worse the significant majority of damage was done within the past two decades when the consequences of climate change were widely known and yet these specific individuals did nothing to curb or amend their practices.”“Now that we’ve done the hard work of identifying the key players responsible for this crisis we can move forward with holding them accountable” Bartlett added. “And it is my opinion that we need to regulate these individuals swiftly and decisively before they do any more damage.”According to policy analysts urgent regulation is needed in order to monitor and govern the behavior of these targeted individuals who experts say collectively commit as much as 100 percent of violations to the environment each year.Researchers have isolated numerous instances of environmentally harmful activity committed by these 7 billion perpetrators in the past few decades alone identifying practices such as using electric lights shipping packages traveling by car traveling by air buying clothes washing clothes using heat using air conditioning buying food buying water eating meat commuting to work shopping exercising at the gym disposing of waste operating computers operating televisions operating other household electronic appliances and showering—alarming activities that experts say show no signs of remitting.In addition IPCC officials confirmed that billions of pounds per year in waste products can be traced to these 7 billion individuals alone.“We’re actually looking at a situation where a select group of individuals—7125985886 of them to be exact—are singlehandedly responsible for global warming and are refusing to do anything about it” author and activist Dan Cregmann told reporters noting that these culprits have a horrible track record of following recommended environmental guidelines and disclosing their total energy consumption. “Many of these offenders have of course pledged goals for fighting climate change and going green in their daily operations but statistics show these proclamations have been largely ineffective and halfhearted at best.”At press time IPCC officials confirmed that since their report was released this morning 153007 more individuals had been added to the list of top contributors to global warming.
2013-11-22T10:31:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/area-man-can-remember-exactly-where-he-was-what-he-was-1819575890,Area Man Can Remember Exactly Where He Was, What He Was Doing When He Assassinated John F. Kennedy,LANGLEY VA—Saying that he will never forget the events of that fateful day local man Edgar Denton 81 told reporters Friday that five decades later he could still recall exactly where he was and what he was doing the day he shot and killed former U.S. president John F. Kennedy.“Everyone my age has a story about where they were when JFK was assassinated and I’m no exception” said Denton emphasizing that his memories of the Friday morning in which he shouldered his M14 rifle brought the presidential motorcade into his sights and sent a bullet into the brain of the 35th president of the United States remain as vivid as ever. “I remember I was in Dallas at the time. Specifically I was positioned behind a fence at street-level in Dealey Plaza right when I gunned down the president.”“The image of everyone on the streets below panicking because I had just murdered the leader of the free world will stay with me for the rest of my life” Denton continued.Despite a full 50 years having passed since his covert assassination of a sitting U.S. president Denton said that the day on which he killed Kennedy remains fresh in his mind stressing that he could still recall with complete clarity the meticulous preparations he made in the minutes leading up to 12:30 in the afternoon on November 22 1963.In fact the gunman confirmed that he could recall with pinpoint accuracy the exact location of the concealed sniper’s nest he was standing in that morning as he patiently waited for Kennedy’s 1961 Lincoln Continental to turn onto Elm Street and enter into his crosshairs. The contract killer also maintained that he remembers hearing Secret Service director James J. Rowley’s voice coming through his walkie-talkie giving him the go-ahead “like it was yesterday.”Furthermore Denton a former Green Beret and lifelong Freemason told reporters that the passage of time has in no way dulled the immense emotional impact of learning that the president had been successfully killed by him saying that these mental impressions continue to be as lucid for him today as they were on the very day he eliminated JFK.“When Walter Cronkite came on TV and told the nation that JFK was dead it almost didn't feel real” said Denton recounting how he spent much of the historic afternoon inside a safe house cleaning his rifle and thinking “The president’s been shot by me. Oh my God the president’s been shot by me.” “But despite how surreal it all was at the time right now I could walk you through exactly what happened that day: hastily making my way to the rear entrance of the the Dal-Tex building having the CIA pick me up and congratulate me accepting $50000 in bearer bonds. I could even tell you word for word what I wrote on that telegram to Ho Chi Minh.”“I’ll never forget rushing home and hugging my wife and kids and telling them that everything would be all right” added Denton noting that he himself broke down into tears of joy upon realizing that the police had taken another suspect into custody.Denton who said that his violent unseating of the president and the aftermath remain among his most coherent memories explained that he will regularly describe in pitch-perfect detail the circumstances of the slaying to his grandchildren.However the 81-year-old emphasized that JFK’s death is far more than just a personal matter.Indeed the hitman claimed that everyone who contributed to the plot has their own story about where they were when they received word that the extensively coordinated undertaking had been pulled off successfully calling JFK’s assassination the defining moment of a generation for everybody who participated in the murder of the 35th president.“Those of us who worked for months to put an end to the president’s life will always remember where they were on that day” Denton said referring to Dallas resident Abraham Zapruder then–Postmaster General John A. Gronouski and Vice President Lyndon Johnson among many others. “For everyone who conspired to execute the president of the United States in broad daylight that day will always be part of our shared experience.”“It’s definitely way more memorable than that whole thing with his brother” Denton added. “Honestly I barely recollect doing that one at all.”
2013-11-21T11:55:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/inventor-of-gromdar-determined-to-put-a-gromdar-in-ever-1819575883,Inventor Of Gromdar Determined To Put A Gromdar In Every American Home,SAN JOSE CA—Laying out his vision for the company’s future at a shareholder meeting yesterday Gromdar Inc. cofounder and Gromdar inventor Jeffrey Shanes said that he is determined to put a Gromdar in every home in the nation sources reported.Stating that the Gromdar brand name “is synonymous with innovation quality and high performance” Shanes told investors that beginning with its forthcoming line of personal Gromdars sold at licensed Gromdar retailers across the country the company aims to change the American way of life “Gromdar by Gromdar.”“Our goal is not only to put a Gromdar in each home but in each room of each home” said Shanes noting that ever since he built the first laboratory-sized Gromdar as a graduate student he’s envisioned a world in which every citizen has access to a private portable Gromdar. “Gromdar technology has been around for years but until now we haven’t been able to bring Gromdars to the consumer market. Now we have a chance to make Gromdars such an integral part of daily life people will think ‘Can you remember a time without Gromdars?’”“We want people to say ‘I bought a Gromdar for my wife I bought a Gromdar for my mom heck I even bought Gromdars for my kids!’” he continued. “We want people without Gromdars to envy people with Gromdars. This time next year you’re not going to want to be seen in public without a Gromdar of your own.”According to the company’s website Gromdar Inc. originally manufactured Gromdars exclusively for military use winning a lucrative contract with the U.S. Department of Defense to supply powerful Gromdars for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. With profits from the government contract the corporation reportedly invested millions of dollars in research and development to adapt Gromdars for the commercial sector and soon began selling thousands of Gromdars to businesses across the country.Shanes explained to shareholders that advances in technology have allowed Gromdars to be manufactured more efficiently and inexpensively than ever before bringing down the cost and size of the device as well as reducing the numerous safety hazards of Gromdar ownership.Responding to concerns about the marketability of home Gromdars the tech entrepreneur acknowledged that most new products face resistance from the consuming public when they are first introduced. However Shanes expressed his confidence that using a Gromdar—or Gromming—would quickly come to be regarded as a fundamental and indispensable part of everyday life.“Some people might say ‘What do I need a personal Gromdar for? I’m never going to use it’” Shanes said after one investor compared the Gromdar to the Blordash. “That’s the same thing people once said about microwaves but now we can’t live without them. Mark my words the people who are most skeptical of owning a Gromdar are going to be the ones who won’t be able to put their Gromdars down whether they’re at home in their office or traveling.”As part of the company’s efforts to bring Gromdars to the public Shanes said that Gromdar Inc. is embarking on an ambitious marketing initiative including television spots prominent social media campaigns on Facebook and Twitter a sponsorship deal with actor and musician Jared Leto and product placement in popular movies and video games.Shanes also noted that thousands of billboards and public transit advertisements were currently being installed in cities throughout the country featuring a picture of a Gromdar against a white background and the brief tagline “Your Life Your Gromdar.”By the end of the next financial quarter Shanes said his goal is to see consumers lined up around the block to get their hands on the latest Gromdar.“The Gromdar is a truly innovative product that will revolutionize the way we work socialize learn entertain ourselves cook and even exercise” Shanes said while gesturing to a shiny teal Gromdar on a table alongside him. “By 2016 we want to see Gromdars plugged into every kitchen on every car dashboard and bolted into every desk in every school in America. We believe today’s generation will be the Gromdar generation.”“The question isn’t whether you can afford to buy a Gromdar; the question is whether you can afford not to” he added.
2013-11-20T13:24:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/buddhist-extremist-cell-vows-to-unleash-tranquility-on-1819575891,Buddhist Extremist Cell Vows To Unleash Tranquility On West,WASHINGTON—In a 45-minute video posted on Tibetan websites Thursday Tsuglag Rinpoche leader of the Buddhist extremist group Kammaṭṭhāna threatened to soon inflict a wave of peace and tranquility on the West.Speaking in front of a nondescript altar surrounded by candles burning sticks of incense and a small golden statue of the Buddha Rinpoche did not specify when or where an assault of profound inner stillness would occur but stated in no uncertain terms that the fundamentalist Buddhist cell plans to target all Western suffering.“In the name of the Great Teacher we will stop at nothing to unleash a firestorm of empathy compassion and true selflessness upon the West” said Rinpoche adding that all enemies of a freely flowing unfettered state of mind will be “besieged with pure everlasting happiness.” “No city will be spared from spiritual harmony. We will bring about the end to all Western pain and anxiety to all destructive cravings to all greed delusion and misplaced desire. Indeed we will bring the entire United States to its knees in deep meditation.”“Wisdom and virtue to America!” continued Rinpoche. “Wisdom and virtue to all living things on earth!”According to reports Rinpoche stressed throughout his address that Kammaṭṭhāna soldiers would continue waging a tireless holy war on Western feelings of emptiness and negativity for as long as necessary noting that “a jug fills drop by drop” and that “it is better to travel well than to arrive.”The extremist leader specifically criticized the United States for its “blatant disregard of karmic balance within the universe” and ominously claimed that Americans will “one day soon” experience the highest form of metaphysical equilibrium through a union of both body and mind. Rinpoche also said all Western nations would “pay a heavy price in negative thinking and self-doubt” if they do not immediately engage in serious introspection and true spiritual liberation.Sources confirmed the video then featured an uninterrupted 19-minute clip of water quietly flowing between rocks in a small forest creek.Kammaṭṭhāna's video ABOVE: Watch a short clip from the Kammaṭṭhāna's 45-minute video.“From New York City to London Madrid and Paris we will not cease until every major metropolis is left in a state of total nirvana” said Rinpoche brandishing a pink lotus flower before claiming that Kammaṭṭhāna will seize any opportunity to aggressively instill a deep-seated sense of oneness in all Westerners. “We offered the unenlightened governments of America and Europe a chance to embrace the Eightfold Path but you have refused. Now we have no choice but to impose a peaceful spiritual reawakening upon you.”“And if you think even for a moment that we will ever relent remember this: Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle and the life of the candle will not be shortened” Rinpoche added. “You have been warned.”Kammaṭṭhāna a radical Mahāyāna Buddhism movement was founded in Nepal in the late 1970s with the explicit mission to spread a fundamentalist interpretation of the Four Noble Truths to all nonbelievers. According to experts the multinational organization operates somewhere in a remote region of the Himalayas though the current whereabouts of Rinpoche and Kammaṭṭhāna’s other high-ranking members are reportedly unknown.Kammaṭṭhāna first came to international prominence in 1997 when five of its members boarded a New York City subway car and held 42 hostages in a state of transcendent serenity for seven hours while performing atonal syllabic chants. The group then claimed responsibility for a severe 2004 outbreak of interconnectedness in central London later traced to a 23-year-old Kammaṭṭhāna sleeper cell operative who sat cross-legged in Trafalgar Square and read aloud from The Gateless Gate collection of 13th-century Zen koans.Kammaṭṭhāna claims to gain “thousands of newly reincarnated followers each day” and is reportedly known to recruit many young Buddhists from around the world training them in tranquil insurgency tactics at covert monasteries across Eastern Asia.“I want to assure all Americans that we are fully aware of these threats from Kammaṭṭhāna and they will not be taken lightly” acting Secretary of Homeland Security Rand Beers said at a press conference shortly after Rinpoche’s video surfaced adding that several U.S. cities have been placed on high alert and authorities are watching closely for any suspicious peaceful activity in densely populated areas. “We do believe that Kammaṭṭhāna currently possesses the means to inflict widespread balance in the collective subconscious of an American city. However we are doing absolutely everything in our power to prevent that from happening.”“The danger of total enlightenment is very real” Beers added. “And we must be prepared.”At press time sources confirmed that President Obama has authorized a preemptive strike on Kammaṭṭhāna and deployed a fleet of predator drones to bomb Tibet.
2013-11-19T15:14:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/terrified-obama-trapped-inside-healthcare-gov-website-1819575876,Terrified Obama Trapped Inside Healthcare.gov Website,WASHINGTON—According to an urgent report issued today by the White House a terrified and frantic President Obama is currently trapped inside the healthcare.gov website.Early reports indicate the president inadvertently became physically enmeshed in the inner workings of the online health insurance exchange at approximately 11:48 a.m. this morning and is at this very moment attempting to find any possible means of escape from the highly unstable and dangerous healthcare.gov internal network.“Please if anyone can hear me I need help!” said Obama his voice reportedly echoing endlessly in the distance as he carefully stepped along a green grid of individual and family enrollment information. “Is anyone there? Can anyone hear me? I’m Barack Obama President of the United States of America! I need to get out of here!”“Oh dear God there has to be a way out” continued Obama ducking as several lines of text guaranteeing coverage for preexisting conditions flew just inches above his head. “There has to be.”According to reports Obama has spent the last few hours stranded in a dark seemingly infinite three-dimensional insurance matrix made entirely of programming code scrolling ones and zeroes and indecipherable information about government subsidies and has as yet been unable to locate a safe exit from the digital infrastructure of healthcare.gov itself.White House sources have confirmed that Obama is both alone and intensely frightened and that the president may at this moment be endangered by the complicated twisting data fields of healthcare.gov as well as the terabytes of random eligibility notifications and policy cost estimations shooting in all directions.Further reports have warned that any hope of extracting the president from the online marketplace may already be lost.“This isn’t right” said Obama staring as enrollment information for millions of Americans was sucked into a growing cone-shaped vacuum in the middle of the healthcare.gov dimensional plane. “Why is it doing this?”“The mainframe” the president quickly added as hundreds of policy cancellations erupted from the swirling vortex. “I need to get to the health care exchange mainframe.”Reports confirmed that after finally forcing his way past the dense clusters of programming language tangled in the healthcare.gov help page Obama finally reached a complicated system of virtual pipelines sending information about spouses and dependents directly into a pulsating golden orb. Upon reaching his hand into the orb the president was said to be transported directly into the heart of healthcare.gov’s online marketplace.Obama was then reportedly horrified to find himself inside a crumbling software framework surrounded by a chaotic array of randomly scattered premiums out-of-pocket charges and collapsed open enrollment architecture.“Goddammit I don’t know what to do!” Obama said banging his hands in frustration against a wall of binary as the entire healthcare.gov mainframe suddenly froze forcing all previously flowing lines of code to come to a complete standstill. “I can’t fix this! Get me out of this place!”“Please! Just get me out of here!” Obama added as the data grid below his feet shattered into millions of infinitesimal pixels and he plummeted into an infinite void of lost health care coverage.At press time U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius had assured reporters that engineers are working around the clock to free the president from the healthcare.gov site by the beginning of December.
2013-11-18T13:53:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/cancer-researchers-don-t-get-cancer-1819575867,Cancer Researchers: ‘Don’t Get Cancer’,PHILADELPHIA—Calling the contraction of the disease “not good” and saying that not having the illness is highly preferable to having it oncologists representing the American Association for Cancer Research urged the U.S. populace Monday not to get cancer.The panel which consisted of medical experts at the top of their respective fields in cancer research education surgery chemotherapy and radiotherapy addressed the media for 45 minutes saying that people’s best hope in terms of living a long cancer-free life is to never develop cancerous cells in any part of the body ever.“After years of closely studying this illness and learning about how it grows and arbitrarily attacks vital organs throughout the body at an uncontrollable rate until one eventually dies we have concluded that not having cancer is the best way to go” said Dr. Robert Bertino who specializes in molecular biology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. “If you are going to contract a harmful illness get diagnosed with Crohn’s disease meningitis or even Type 2 diabetes. Anything but cancer. Cancer is just the worst.”“A lot of people die from it” he added. “It’s bad.”According to specialists people should not contract colon cancer breast cancer pancreatic cancer stage IV lung cancer esophageal cancer liver cancer non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma or any one of the roughly 200 other known forms of cancer. In addition researchers confirmed that if it comes down to having terminal vs. non-terminal cancer both are undesirable but non-terminal is recommended.However oncologists said that even less threatening forms of the illness such as non-melanoma skin cancer should be steered clear of with Bertino explaining that “You have the surgery you think it’s gone it comes back for some reason God knows why and then it spreads to your lymph nodes and that’s that.”AACR officials went on to recommend that individuals should avoid having a family history of cancer and that if people must grow tumors they should make sure to only develop benign ones.“When a patient comes in to visit me because they have malignant tissue in their breast or under their arm the first thing I say is ‘It would be much better if this hadn’t happened’” said Dr. Sydney Drysdale head of oncology at Johns Hopkins Medical Center. “I tell them I have studied this illness for decades I’m the foremost expert when it comes to the spread of cancer and then I look them in the eye and say cancer is literally the last thing I’d want in my body. I tell them it’s not a death sentence but that it certainly could be. It’s cancer. You shouldn’t get it.”“Sometimes patients will ask about clinical trials and I’ll say clinical trials wouldn’t even be an issue if you hadn’t gotten cancer in the first place” Drysdale continued. “My best advice: Don’t have abnormal cells that uncontrollably divide and invade other tissues.”Top cancer researchers throughout the country urged individuals to think of the benefits of not having cancer such as being alive for a much longer period of time feeling healthy not putting your family through what will easily be the most difficult period of their entire lives never feeling like you’re at the mercy of near impossible and hopeless science and being able to die of natural causes and not cancer.Moreover while 10 out of 10 oncologists recommended never having cancer 100 percent of people who do not currently have cancer reportedly said they are much happier because of it.“If I could do it all over again I would not have gotten cancer” said 46-year-old Kevin Glanville who is currently battling chronic myeloid leukemia. “Getting chemotherapy two times per week and constantly feeling weak and nauseous when there is a good chance the treatment won’t even work is much less attractive to me than say not dealing with those circumstances.”“My doctor contacted some colleagues of his who work in the cancer research lab at the Mayo Clinic” he continued “and they said that for the foreseeable future if there is any way I cannot have cancer anymore I should do that.”
2013-11-13T13:02:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/cowardly-refugee-running-away-from-problems-1819575853,Cowardly Refugee Running Away From Problems,BERAHLE ETHIOPIA—Six months after deciding his life was just too hard and fleeing over the border to Ethiopia cowardly Eritrean man Ismael Semed continues to hide from his problems at the Berahle refugee camp sources confirmed this week.According to international aid workers the 33-year-old refugee a member of East Africa’s Afar ethnic group who wimped out and abandoned his home last May following a violent raid by the Eritrean Army would rather run off and live in a makeshift tent in the middle of the desert than own up to the challenges in his life and deal with them like a grown man.“When the going got tough Ismael could have bucked up and addressed his issues face-to-face but instead he just took off to a different country at the first sign of trouble” Red Cross worker David Rowe said of the pathetic runaway noting that Semed threw in the towel the second a large well-armed military regiment raided his village and slaughtered his family. “Well I have news for you buddy: You can’t just bury your head in the sand every time life gives you lemons. When a problem comes up you fix it. You fix it and move on with your life. Because that’s what adults do.”“Is it easier to just ignore all your problems—like ethnic cleansing and homelessness—and hope they go away? Sure” Rowe continued. “But no one ever succeeded in life by taking the easy way out.”Describing him as “a quitter plain and simple” sources confirmed that Semed completely chickened out the night of the massacre by crawling out the back of his hut and cowering in the nearby brush where sources speculated the weak-willed man decided to just completely shut out the sight of his settlement being razed and his relatives’ bodies being thrown into unmarked graves rather than tackling the problem head-on. The spineless pushover reportedly scampered off with his tail between his legs to the refugee camp the following day and is now by all accounts content to just give up and pity himself for the rest of his life.Human rights group representatives confirmed that the spineless man breaks into tears every time they attempt to ask him how many women and girls in his village were sexually assaulted during the raid with Semed reportedly bawling like a helpless child just because someone brought up something he didn’t like. Additionally whenever aid workers even mention the subject of rebuilding the homes destroyed in the raid—an issue that let’s face it isn’t going to fix itself—he reportedly pushes the volunteers away just like he pushes away all of his responsibilities.Sources went on to report that Semed a big crybaby widower who shouldn’t be using the murder of his wife and children as an excuse to just utterly give up would rather live off humanitarian handouts for the rest of his life than snap out of it and get his act together.“Ismael needs to realize that everyone faces challenges in their lives and that you can’t just pull a blanket over your head and expect someone else to take care of everything for you” said State Department official John Pollard who echoed the sentiments of all those familiar with Semed by asserting that the oversensitive refugee needs to “suck it up” and “grow a pair.” “When my computer died I lost everything. But I didn’t turn tail and run 100 miles to a United Nations relief camp just because things didn’t go my way. No I went to Best Buy and bought an external hard drive so it wouldn’t happen again.”Nonprofit workers explained that unfortunately Semed may never stop running away from his difficulties noting that whenever they approach him about the possibility of voluntary repatriation—an option that would allow the gutless refugee to finally grow up and act like a mature adult for once in his life—the weak little excuse for a man resolutely refuses to return to Eritrea.Instead the pitiful thin-skinned man said he would rather stay in the refugee camp for the foreseeable future because that’s the mind of a quitter for you.“I’m just barely starting to feel safe here and going back to my village now is something I can’t even imagine” Semed told reporters repeating another one of his 1000 pathetic excuses for why he can’t confront his problems and actually do something about them which is what an actual grown-up would do. “So many of my friends and relatives were murdered right in front of me that day and it could have just as easily been me. I still hear their screams in my dreams every night.”“Right now I’m just happy to be [a complete fucking pussy]” he added.

Assume readiness. Assume readiness.”“Lockdown begins in five… four… three… two… one…” the announcement added.According to a spokesman for the Director himself disturbances such as this are “highly irregular” in the Tiberius Complex and sources should “rest assured” that those intruders responsible—be they agents of the resistance or covert ops forces from the Krymt Group—would soon be apprehended and delivered to Central Station forthwith for immediate reeducation.However numerous other Tiberius sources head data engineering chief Maxwell Quint among them have expressed a growing concern that Zone 17 was perhaps not sufficiently designed to contain potential security breaches and that should the intruders somehow make it past the Lambent Gate all may be lost.Reports have also surfaced that the Director may have already safely absconded to the roof level of Tiberius Tower where air transport is said to await.“Tiberius employees do not panic” read a statement from the Director uploaded to the personal data devices of each and every Tiberius worker. “Your Director loves you. Harm shall not befall this complex. Take all precautions and bring the intruders to heel. Vigilance and sacrifice are required. Contain the threat and resume operations.”“I am with you” the Director’s statement concluded. “I am all around you.”At press time a deep red glow had begun to fill the complex signaling that the Omega Protocol had gone into effect.UPDATE: Sources are confirming that the Omega Protocol has failed. Again the Omega Protocol has reportedly failed. All surviving personnel are advised to evacuate the Complex immediately.
2013-11-12T11:56:00-06:00,https://www.theonion.com/mariana-trench-once-again-named-worst-place-to-raise-ch-1819575833,Mariana Trench Once Again Named Worst Place To Raise Child,NEW YORK—Parenting magazine released its annual list of the best and worst places to raise a child this week once again naming the Mariana Trench—an undersea chasm located 36000 feet beneath the western Pacific Ocean—as the least desirable location for rearing children.The periodical’s staff reportedly selected amongst thousands of locations weighing a diverse range of criteria such living costs air quality and local amenities categories for which the pitch-black silt-covered abyss unanimously received an “F” rating.“In all categories the Mariana Trench consistently got our lowest marks as a good place to start a family” the 14-page article read in part. “The school system is nonexistent the nearest playground is 300 nautical miles away and at over 15000 pounds per square inch the hydrostatic pressure is enough to crush a child in less than a second.”“While the area does contain a low crime rate that benefit is quickly negated by the Mariana Trench’s lack of a police department not to mention fire sanitation highway or public works departments” the article continued.The Mariana Trench with zero acres of community parkland a median household income of $000000.00 and an unemployment rate of 100 percent has held its spot as Parenting’s worst place to raise a child for seven consecutive years now thanks largely to its un-family-friendly freezing temperatures and high concentration of exothermic bacteria.According to the magazine competition for the worst spot in the rankings was particularly fierce this year with the Mariana Trench competing with locations as far-ranging as Mt. Everest an industrial slaughterhouse an iceberg drifting in the Arctic St. Louis and the cone of Hawaii’s Mauna Loa volcano.“In composing our rankings we found that compared to somewhere like Sunnyvale CA—a town in which we would highly recommend parents raise their children—the Mariana Trench lacks many of the conveniences such as walking trails or shopping outlets that would be attractive to a family” the magazine’s editor Samuel Norton explained. “While you could conceivably go hiking with your kids in the [crescent-shaped oceanic valley] Challenger Deep or sign them up for swim team you would still have to somehow get over the perpetual darkness that constantly cloaks the trench in all directions.”“And if you’re looking for a decent pediatrician you’re going to have your work cut out for you” Norton added.The magazine’s editors found that with no community centers golf courses neighborhood gardens or social outlets of any sort to speak of there was little if anything to distract a mother or father from the extremely stressful lifestyle that would be typical of raising a family 5269 fathoms beneath the sea.Parenting also criticized the housing market in the Mariana Trench emphasizing that the cost of building and maintaining a state-of-the-art titanium-reinforced bathysphere capable of withstanding the location’s volcanic heat vents and constant earthquakes would be a minimum of roughly $20 million—an investment they said was far out of the range of most families.“In terms of commuting options alone the Mariana Trench would prove a real nightmare for any working parent” Norton remarked going on to call the location’s utter lack of public transportation “simply unacceptable.” “I mean to even reach the trench in the first place you would need to acquire an extremely sophisticated diving bell convince your family to stow themselves one or two at a time along with all of their possessions and then plunge 6.85 miles down into a dark undersea chasm devoid of any sense of community or any warm-blooded life whatsoever.”“At that point you have to ask yourself ‘Is this really what’s best for my child?’” Norton added.Ultimately the magazine’s staff urged parents to consider their family first when choosing whether or not to live in the Mariana Trench.“The obstacles your child will face in their first years of school are already going to be enormous” Norton said. “Having to contend with the challenge of having their head literally implode when exposed to their hometown’s atmosphere can only make things worse.”
