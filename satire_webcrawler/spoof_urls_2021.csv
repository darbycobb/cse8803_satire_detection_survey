He plans to overturn the election results defy the people's vote and give Donald Trump four more disastrous years in the White House.His plan is simple. Ignore the legal and certified vote count of the Electoral College in just a few of the states that Trump lost. Select new and pro-Trump Electoral College members from those states who will then certify their vote for Trump.It is simple and easy; it’s like sending back to Santa Claus the gifts you don’t like and saying you want a Ferrari instead of the tricycle. If you lose a tennis match to Roger Federer announce that you won and pick another presenter to give you the trophy. Easy.Or if Meryl Streep wins another Academy Award scratch it and give it instead to Ivanka Trump for her White House performance. Easier.Sound like the world fell into the Alice In Wonderland rabbit hole? You bet and the Queen of Hearts is Donald Trump. Like the song Anything Goes with the Trump constituency and his friends anything goes.With Louie Gohmert’s thinking constitutional law analysis and his tiddlywinks experience Louie could make Donald Trump the Pope!Anything goes and didn’t Trump say “You can grab a woman by the pussy and get away with it because you’re famous.”So Louis Gohmert is grabbing the 2020 Presidential Election by the pussy for Donald Trump and thinks he’s going to get away with it.Nah! It’s called sedition and sedition is a felony punishable by fines and up to 20 years in prison.Read more by this author:
Friday 1 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/uk/151880/amazon-clamp-down-on-stupid-questions,Amazon Clamp Down On Stupid Questions,In a shock move Amazon have finally started prosecuting people who ask purposefully stupid questions about products on their site.The decision comes as campaigners ramped up efforts to pressure the consumer giant to get something done about the annoying trend this past month.Jenny Livid from campaign group 'Alright Enough Now' told us 'we've been asking Amazon to do something about this for ages but they said it was out of their hands.'Worried that prosecution may put people off from asking genuine questions Livid reassured us 'we're not talking about dumb questions people ask them all the time. We're talking about this new trend of purposefully stupid questions.''We've seen people asking 'is this real silk?' about a teapot. Asking 'can I eat this with gravy?' on a lawnmower listing or 'can I use this as a hat?' on a listing for a workbench. These are the things we're trying to stop.''The most common question by far' she continued 'and if you look this is featured on almost every listing on Amazon right now whether it is for a digital download or a bicycle is 'is this gluten free?''It wasn't funny the first time I saw it it certainly wasn't any funnier the twelve millionth!'With this apparent victory in the bag for the campaign group we asked what comes next?Livid told us 'well we won't rest on our laurels. Next we combat people who reply to genuine questions about a product with unhelpful answers such as 'I didn't buy this one so I can't help' or 'I bought it as a present for my son so I don't know the answer..' if that's the case the question wasn't for you! Don't answer it!'Amazon declined to comment but our sources told us that 'Amazon being Amazon retribution will be swift and exact.'

He added that he is happy-as-hell for the yaks because it broke his heart to see the astoundingly high suicide rate among the elderly animals.Meanwhile famed racing yak rancher Tumki Kalalala says that he will now probably pack up and move to neighboring Bangladesh where yak racing is still the number one sport.

And not a fancy smart 'phone - one of those old Motorola Razr flip-phones!The picture is either out of focus or is so pixelated that the image is unidentifiable. And the sound often cuts in and out or disappears altogether.An inside source told us: 'He's not happy. In fact I'd even say he's furious. You can use that in your headline if you want. Yeah furious!'The reporter has been seen outside the EU headquarters in Brussels out of focus in a charming nightime Italian countryside backdrop out of focus and even in the port of Calais out of focus. In the latest snub he was frozen mid-sentence and then the feed was lost completely. They handed back to the studio anchor who was wearing a wry knowing smile.Fellow reporters are said to be on their guard. Our source told us 'the bosses need to tread carefully. James knows people. Important people. He'll only take this for so long. He's been reporting overseas for many years. He's made a lot of friends. That's all I'm saying.'Details of what caused the snub are unclear at this time.

I mean obviously there is nowhere to go at the moment so the cinema is out and we are not in each other's social bubble but I am sure that we will go out at least once together this year.''Oh what is my Tom like?' asked his father Gary. 'Oh I know he is like a politician always over-promising and under-delivering.'

Enya is a favourite and the more raucous sound of the New Seekers is great but I listened to too much U2 last year and it induced in me a growing sense of anxiety and nausea so I thought that I would stop listening to it. If Bono The Edge Larry and Adam read this it is nothing personal but then Fritz Radio played 'New Year's Day' and I thought 'damn why?' I almost phoned the station to give them a piece of my mind but they charge £2.99 a minute so I didn't bother.'Gary is now sticking to his other resolutions of drinking less and not thinking about his boss at weekends.
Friday 1 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/151873/rare-white-house-intestinal-studies-emerge-on-eve-of-trump-departure,Rare White House intestinal studies emerge on eve of Trump departure,Breaking: A newly-emerged whistle-blower has broken open peculiarities at The White House for press coverage.Until now it was not known that a group of scientists occupy a White House attic to record and measure events occurring throughout this august building.These persons remain out of sight by day (meals served by dumb waiter) and only take exercise on White House lawns in the small hours after midnight.They keep records on numerous items from use of dishware length of stay by visitors consumption of kleenex (plus disposal) and such matters.More surprising perhaps has been the emergence of IES (internal emission studies) which track expulsions from all who pass through this historical site.Unknown previously scientists have developed a special app which tracks designates qualifies and describes every "intestinal event" affecting air quality at The White House.How long these attic specialists have been doing this work historically is not known. However records stretching back to President Lyndon Baines Johnson are accessible.Additionally extraordinary these IE studies have discovered a tendency by White House presidential occupants to practice special effects with their emissions.Some of these have a musical tendency which has led to the additional study of what is known as "Lower Chamber Music."President Carter for example could use his orifice to practice “Way down upon the Suwannee River” to which President Reagan attempted to compete with “O Say Can You See”.Mr. Trump has disdained these kinds of efforts satisfying himself with reproductions of the sound effects from the cannons of Fort Sumter.Bill and Monica apparently took LCM (Lower Chamber Music) into new directions with efforts to produce duets and Mr. Obama is considered most accomplished with his (an obvious self-reference) “You must have been a beautiful baby coz baby look at you now!”Mr. Bush (W that is; records of HW “not available”) disdained musical effects and studied his sounds for hints of what to do with foreign policy.Most notably here the invasion of Iraq was strongly influenced.Mr. Trump's outstanding accomplishment related to his choice of entrees and expanding waist during his tenure has been to fill the emission space of 42 cubic meters far more than previous occupants (apart from Mr. Johnson).Mr. Biden and his son are reputed to be interested in duet possibilities and are working on a composition titled "Burisma Overture in F Major."

The annoying neighbor parking his car right outside our house our window or right across our drive making it extremely difficult for us to gain access to the garage.Spare a thought then for one man who had an even bigger - and longer - problem to deal with this morning when a long and large lorry was left straddling his garden path making it impossible for his wife to get her motorbike out of the property when she wanted to go to the market!Moys Kenwood 57 knew very well that the vehicle was parked outside of his house last night before he went to bed but assumed that it would have been moved by its driver before the Englishman awoke as it had been for the last three days.Sadly this was not the case.The lorry belonging to a company that buys rice from local farmers was still blocking any exit other than by on foot.Kenwood's wife went to alert the driver who because the company is based in Phnom Penh and pay its staff in peanuts usually sleeps in the vehicle's cab.Alas the man was not there.A search quickly conducted by Mrs. Kenwood revealed that he was not in the back of the lorry nor underneath it involved in any kind of maintenance.Unable to go to the market she became irritated frustrated annoyed and then furious in that order. She raged around the lorry for a few minutes talking about what she would do once the driver was located. She went inside to use the toilet.The driver who was watching from a safe distance after hunkering down for the night in a hammock slung between two trees quickly emerged from his hidey-hole revved-up his vehicle and was gone in a flash.Mrs. Kenwood plans to put some bollards out tonight.

Friday 1 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/uk/151870/taxi-driver-gutted-over-hamilton-knighthood,Taxi Driver 'Gutted' Over Hamilton Knighthood,Recent news of Lewis Hamilton receiving a knighthood in the New Year's honours list has left one London cabbie 'gutted'.John Smith 56 has been a black cab driver for 30 years and in that time has taken close to 600000 fares. But news of Lewis Hamilton's knighthood left him fuming as he explained:'In my time I've driven expectant mothers to hospital I've got brides-to-be to the church on time I've got a nurse to her ward who then went on to save lives! Business has been done because I got the chap to his meeting creating trade jobs and a stable economy! All because of me and my cab!''What's he done?' he continued 'just sat there and whizzed round in a better car than anyone else? Appeared in a few adverts for a huge watch no one wants or can afford? And he's now a knight of the realm? For that? The world's gone mad I tell you!'When we explained what an achievement winning seven World Drivers' Championship titles was and about Hamilton's 'off-track' charitable work such as setting up the Hamilton Foundation championing diversity and equality in motorsport supporting disadvantaged children and various other philanthropic endeavours Smith didn't seem to care.'All well and good but he's got the money to do all that. He's not out there working like me! I'm getting people to where they need to be getting things done! I'm gutted mate. It should have been me!'We further explained that Hamilton was only able to do all this because of his and his family's hard work and sacrifice from a very young age which enabled him to climb the ladder of motorsport against all odds and against the tide of a racially adverse climate within the industry.If someone works hard why should they not reap the benefits later if they are fortunate enough to be in that position and given that opportunity?'Well he's still a knob..' Smith told us and drove off.Fair enough...

What’s the it? The it could be anything from a juvenile tweet to the entire state of Georgia.Attempting to belittle the $600 Democratic COVID-19 supplement Donald Trump said it should have been a $2000 supplement.Well it didn’t take Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi any time to accept Donald Trump’s suggestion. She put before the House a measure to pass an added $2000 COVID-19 check. It also passed without a whimper.Whiplashed Donald Trump asked "Huh? What just happened?".Of course Mitch McConnell and the Republicans were against the $2000 supplement. They didn’t even want to pass the $600 supplement.Ironically Donald Trump finds himself on Nancy Pelosi's side.Talk about CA-RAM-BA! And the Mexican hat dance Trump must be doing!While the $2000 supplementary check was passed in the House the majority leader in the Senate Mitch McConnell doesn’t want to bring it to a vote on the Senate floor because it's certain to pass.And now the state of Georgia enters this stew.Georgia citizens want that extra $2000 check. Georgia also has a runoff election on January 5 for two Senate seats. If Democrats win both seats the Republicans will lose their majority in the Senate and it will go to the Democrats. The Democrats will bring the measure to a vote. Georgians will have an added $2000.Whew!Good-bye Mitch McConnell.Hello Senate leader Chuck Schumer.And thank you Donald Trump!Read more by this author:
Friday 1 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/world/151866/singing-happy-birthday-while-washing-hands-has-strange-side-effects,Singing 'Happy Birthday' While Washing Hands Has Strange Side Effects?,Bristol England (A country in no way associated with the rest of Europe for those American readers.) Scientists at Bristol Community College have discovered that singing Happy Birthday that many damn times in a single year can indeed lead to some very strange side effects.The findings have led most people who sang the song while washing their hands during Covid to agree: 'Huh jeez we didn't see that comin'?!'While most who sang it for the correct washing time admitted that they are entirely sick of singing it many more were willing to concede that they had put in a lack-luster performance of the song during actual birthday singings. "I completely mumble through all happy birthday office and zoom singings now. I used to love that song" told Emily Crudsmear. "Now I just associate it with horrible suffering and a wretched death. If I never hear it again it will be too soon."Still others had it wors. Sheila Armstead of Leeds can't stop 'air-washing' her hands whenever she hears the Birthday song now. "All of a sudden at my granddaughter's 4th birthday I just started rubbing my hands together in the air. I just could not stop! I was terrified. I don't think it's ever going away." She also reported a similar incident during Coronation Street only a week later.The Bristol scientists say that Ms. Armstead isn't alone. "Air-washing will become the new pandemic" foretold Al Flurtberger lead scientist of the happy birthday study. "It's like hand Turrets syndrome in a way. Why even I can feel my hands twitching when I hear that song now. Don't sing it!"Mr. Flurtberger found that sticking his hands deep in his pockets helps to cure his urges. And we are pretty sure he was still talking about the birthday song.Still many others reported that if they now hear the song at an office birthday or on TV or during appropriate outdoor dining they immediately have the strong urge to get up and go and wash their hands. "I could barely make it through the entire song before I could feel my feet moving towards the break room sink" warned Kim Schlickey a receptionist in Norwich. "I'd go completely bonkers if I couldn't wash my hands and I heard that song now. I'll never be the same. Can I get workmen's comp for that you reckon?""Our science man Flurtberger who we found lingering around the ladies bathroom at the college had only one known cure. "Most people will probably never be cured. Especially women. Like these ones here" he assured pointing at two students. "Others can only hope and pray that with enough effort and personal perseverance this single cure will help solve all of these immense life-damaging side effects of singing Happy Birthday thousands of times in one year. My conclusion after many millions of dollars spent on this important research is this: the very advice I'd give my own family if afflicted with such a horrible disease. Here it is. Are you ready? OK. Here you go. Are you sure you're ready? You don't look ready. OK here are my official research findings official worldwide release: Pick a flippin' different song to sing you silly twits! Try Yankee Doodle Dandy or Somewhere Over The Rainbow or maybe La Cucaracha—anything. Just take a chill pill on The Happy Birthday Song for a bit. i'm outta here..."Flurtberger then announced his retirement tucked a twenty in my breast pocket lit a fancy cigar and left via an expensive speedboat yelling "so long suckers!"Writer's note: I received my Covid-19 this week and feel fine—other than a strange desire to hang upside down in a dark place... oh well.

This went on for about an hour before finally stopping.Kenwood said later:"I don't know what all that was about! It's usually so quiet around these parts. I suppose it must have been some special occasion or other."

Friday 1 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/world/151864/gal-pagos-tortoise-to-race-hare,Galápagos Tortoise To Race Hare,A rare giant tortoise that has evolved independently of other tortoises on the remote Galápagos Islands is to feature in a special New Year's Day race against a hare in only the second such showdown in history.The tortoise named Speedy Gonzales by local Ecuadoreans is the result of a mystery breeding program that has resulted in the animal developing the physique of a 100-meter sprinter and the enthusiasm necessary to take part.Scientists made some minor physiological changes to Speedy during the 6-month project including scaling down the animal's system from four legs to just two.Although slightly awkward at first Speedy has developed a real aptitude for sprinting and says he is confident of beating a mere hare.Galápagoean tortoises usually weigh in the region of 350 to 400 kilograms but Speedy has been put through an extensive training regime and is currently down to 80 kilograms.The 15-km race around the island of Isabela will take place at 5pm and based on trials already run should last around 8 minutes.In the only previous encounter of this kind another tortoise also managed to beat a hare to the finish line when the latter became complacent and took a nap allowing the former to edge closer and closer to victory.There'll be no such complacency today however according to Speedy.He said:"I'm going to annihilate that wabbit!"
Saturday 2 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/151895/tales-from-beaver-crossing-smuckmeister-and-the-duck,Tales From Beaver Crossing: Smuckmeister And The Duck,BILLINGSGATE POST: There’s nothing like a good duck story to start the New Year. And nobody tells a duck story better than Elmer Smuckmeister the most famous resident of Beaver Crossing Nebraska.He swears it happened. It was duck season in Nebraska. V-shaped formations of Mallards and Pintails had been easing down into the cornfields and ponds for the past two weeks.This was the best time of the year for Smuckmeister. He was all geared up with his Male Mallard Duck Hunting 3D Printed Shirt which he wore under his Duck Camp Vantage 3L Softshell Late Season Wetland Jacket. Covered up to his breast bone with L.L. Bean Apex Waterfowl Bootfoot Waders he was ready to roll.It goes without saying that any duck gun should have swivel studs so you can have your hands free for carrying decoys or wading. Also a waterfowl gun should be fairly drab to keep wily ducks from spying it. And that is why Elmer sticks with his old Winchester Model 12 to knock ‘em out of the sky.It was late afternoon. Elmer had been up since dawn. Even his decoys were getting bored. But finally just before he was ready to pack it in for the day quacking like a berserk Banshee rag picker he drew a threesome of handsome Mallards into his sights. He pulled the trigger on his Remington 12 and saw one of the birds fall from the sky. But he didn’t drop straight down. The wounded duck flew off until he hit a farmer’s barn falling to the ground; dead as a duck.Elmer followed the duck to the duck’s final destination. But upon reaching the fallen fowl he was stunned to hear that the farmer Joe Cocolochec was claiming the duck as his own.“WTF are you saying Joe? I shot the sumbitch and he’s mine pure and simple.”“Not so fast Elmer. He hit my barn and by common law I can claim him mine by adverse possession.”“You’re full of shit Joe. I want my fucking duck.”“Then let’s settle it the country way Elmer.”“What’s that?”“We square off and kick each other in the nuts until only one of us is left standing” said Joe.“And I get the first shot cuz it’s my idea.”So Joe drop-kicks Elmer in the nuts and Elmer flops around on the ground finally gets up holding his groin and says “Its my turn now.”“Naw” said the smirking Joe. “You can have the duck.”Dr. Slim: “I love duck stories. That was a Hell of an ending.”Dirty: “Yo Dr. Dude. I hope the duck wasn’t hurt.”

Glock shrugged and said 'Nothing really I just like it. Thought it was a bit ironic and a bit of fun.'Unfazed at this point and not sensing anything to be afoot Murs broke in and asked after the lad's grandmother but again Glock shrugged saying 'She's fine thanks. She's at home sending positive vibes.'The panel throwing confused glances to one another Will.i.am jumped in and asked about Glock's health. 'Any underlying health concerns? You feelin' OK? Any little brothers or sisters? Are they OK?' he asked the lad.'No all good thanks. I'm a little nervous I suppose' he replied.The Zoom crowd were now fully suspicious as were the judges and crew members could be seen running around visibly shaken on the edge of the set.It was left to veteran judge Tom Jones to get to the bottom of it and with his booming Welsh tones he went straight in and asked Glock what his game was.'I just enjoy singing Sir. Thought I'd come and give it a go' Glock told him.Stunned the judges just looked at him and then at one another. One of the production managers collapsed at the side of the stage and the feed was quickly cut to an extended advert break. When the show returned there was no sign or mention of Glock for the duration of the programme.We reached out to The Voice for clarification but no response was forthcoming.A similar incident nearly occurred two years ago on 'Britains Got Talent' when Samantha Pipkin a plate spinner from Toxteth was thought to have had no sad back story but further investigation found she was originally a welder called Ted. So while not technically sad it ticked a box which allowed her to continue in the competition.

He quipped that Trump has never met a calorie he didn’t like.He added that Trump is the type of person who salts his bacon strips.Melania recently said that she’s getting fed up with him eating food in bed.

I managed to coax him forward with a bit of mince pie. He took a while to trust us but he was soon eating from my hand' Simms told us.'Mo called the authorities while I was doing this and they soon turned up. After that we were ushered out of the house while the experts took over' he finished.Cameron was moved down from the loft in a cage and whisked away in a large truck to an undisclosed location.Officials refused to comment directly when we contacted them but we managed to speak to a former deputy who told us 'we'd been wondering where he went. I have no idea if he moved from house to house or was in that particular loft the whole time.''To be honest though I'm not totally convinced he hasn't staged this. A little coincidental that he's 'found' shortly after Brexit is finally done' our source told us.

The woman's face contorted in horror and Kenwood reached for the remote.He'd had enough took a gulp of water and got on with his tea in silence.

Also he said Fernandes had been at United nearly a year.Wearing an incredulous expression on his face Rosenior countered every stupid thing that Hutchison said rubbishing his opinion gesturing with wide arm movements and exasperated looks and laughter until Hutchison realising he himself had said something daft stood up as if he were going to challenge Rosenior.Leroy sprang up clenching his big fists and time stood still.Moments passed. The other hosts an ex-footballer and some woman kept silent possibly nipping-in their arseholes in the excitement.Hutchison sat down and put his lip out.Later they fell out again during the quiz when Leroy shouted out an answer without pressing his buzzer.Just before Kenwood turned the TV off the pair were at loggerheads again about whether or not Tottenham were showing enough ambition and about attacking and defensive boxing styles.

He demanded it all be ripped out and replaced with alternative adornments and decided to return to Washington D.C. and attempt to retain his White House residence by launching a coup and overturning the election results with the help of his most trusted stooges in the Republican Party."We won a great victory in November I won't go back to Mar-A-Lago.

She made a quick exit through the window taking the tree with her and quickly planted it in their garden. But in her haste she didn't spot it was a fake tree. One of those really realistic ones with the built-in lights.''Still plugged in as soon as the tree went into the ground 'BANG!' 240 volts up through her! Didn't stand a chance' he continued.The resulting cascade of sparks blew Miss Parker's shoes clean into next doors garden and set the fake tree on fire. This fire in turn set the shed a fence and some nearby bushes alight. This resulted in the twelve surrounding houses to be evacuated due to the toxic fumes.Investigators are still at the scene and the fire service are still attempting to get the blaze under control.

After falling off three times and stopping to have a pee twice he managed to hack it to his front door. Sadly he had left his keys at the party so totally oblivious he curled up in the snow on his front doorstep and fell asleep.Next morning local police found him still lying on the ground. They dragged him off to the police station to warm up and sober up. After studying CCTV cameras and realising he was riding his mountain bike as pissed as a German newt he was fined and banned from driving for six months.This made headline news after the CCTV film of the biker was smuggled on to YouTube. It went viral because unknowingly his performance on the mountain bike was quite stupendous: slaloms bouncing off bollards hitting lamp-posts falling off getting back on his bike peeing up trees and defeating the treacherous slippery cobblestone roads in the village.Red Bull spotted his fantastic ride and offered the unknown biker a contract to stunt ride for them he agreed! From 2021 he will be jumping off the side of Bavarian mountains bombing down single-trail tracks all over the planet doing flip-flop stunts and getting paid thousands of bucks for the pleasure!His girlfriend is not really happy about his extremely dangerous future but loves the money he will be earning and ordered a 100K Merc-jeep to ease her fears!

One Eric Strychnine said:"it could just be the angle or a trick of the light."But animal rights activist Petunia Gribble raged:"It's a wanton act of gross indecency. It's demented disgraceful and despicable. I've always wanted to get those three words together in a sentence! By the way I've never had a relationship."Timmy was unavailable for comment.

They are speculating in private during breakfast lunch dinner and tea time on how they will remove Donald Trump from the White House if he refuses to budge on Inauguration Day.Why is this a how problem?When someone jumps the White House fence does the Secret Service require a Master Class debate historical referencing or a term paper to figure out how to remove the fence jumper? No. They throw the intruder to the ground cuff him read the guy his Miranda Rights and haul him off in the police van.Neat fast easy!If after 12:00 noon on January 20th Donald Trump remains in the Oval Office he should be treated like the guy who jumped the fence.Giuliani might put up a verbal stink. Ignore Giuliani’s verbal stink. Read Trump his Miranda Rights cuff him and haul him off in the police van. You may have to take Giuliani too.If Don Jr. and Ivanka try to pull Trump out of the police van and back into the White House haul them off in the same police van.The Secret Service announced that there was no government playbook on removing a lingering ex-president. Playbook? It isn't as though you’re planning a one-way trip to Mars. You are removing a trespasser.Nancy Pelosi says she wants to pull Trump out by his hair.

At 60 mph the rooster appeared nonplussed as he effortlessly went into second gear. Then shifting it up a notch he whipped across the gravel road in front of the startled Smuckmeister and pulled into the farmyard of Joe Cocolochek.Now Elmer and Joe had had their differences; the recent duck controversy where Joe Cocolochek kicked him in the nuts was still in Elmer’s recollection.“Hey Joe WTF’s the deal with the three-legged chicken? Sumbitch is faster than greased lightning.”“Well Elmer. I’m glad you asked.”“I know both you and wife like the drumstick. What happens if you have a guest and he likes drumsticks too?”“Hadn’t thought of that Joe. How do they taste?”“Don’t know Elmer. Never been able to catch one of the bastards.”Dr. Slim: “That could only happen if the chicken stumbled.”Dirty: “Yo Dr. Dude. Never happen unless the third leg goes sideways.”

The season has come and gone with no further announcement of a new name. Goodell today confirmed this is because the name is staying.He announced 'we as an organisation feel that the naming of teams is a potential hot potato subject. We are an inclusive outfit and to reflect this in 2021 we are ordering all teams to change their name to 'Football Team' for the foreseeable future.'Teams will only be allowed to use their town city or state name followed by 'football team'. This will see the San Francisco 49'rs become the San Francisco Football Team and the Houston Texans will likewise be the Houston Football Team.'We don't want to see future campaigns from rams or buccaneers cowboys or ravens demanding we stop using their names in a derogatory manner' Goodell continued.College football is as yet unaffected.When asked what would happen in the case of New York who field two teams the Jets and the Giants Goodell told us 'we are currently in talks with the Jets to keep their name. After only winning 2 games in a season they can't really be called a 'Football Team'.

He said that since the ocean water is hotter it is making the female lobsters look extremely redder and more unattractive than they already are.He also noted that the Atlantic seaweed has taken on a more sewer-like smell which can be blamed on the nasty red dust coming out of east Africa.Many seafood restaurants are starting to try and breed their own lobsters.But it can be very difficult and quite time consuming due to one employee having to hold down the female lobster as another employee tries to force the male lobster to penetrate her.

Or if me wife and I succumb to the evil virus and they're left as orphans? How will they cope? How will they feed themselves? Oh my God!"And he worried on:"How about me health? What will I do if I can't get me medicine? Or if the price of it goes through the roof - what then? And me mam in England! She's 84 years old and I might never get back there to see her again! Oh my God!"And on:"And what about me visa? If I haven't got any work they won't renew me visa then I can't stay here but I'll have no money to fly home and I'll probably end up in jail for violating the terms of the visa stuck in some rat-infested filthy stinking boiling-hot cell with excrement in the corner and some grubby hairy bloke trying to bum me.

Or so they think.Sensibly waiting in the wings respectful of the Constitution and unwilling to reduce the US to a banana republic is Mitt Romney. Unlike the Werewolf and the Haircut Romney has executive experience as the successful Governor of Massachusetts. He also has pizzaz.A haircut or a spotted leopard beard do not make for pizzaz.So on the 6th of January eleven Senate Republicans led by leopard-spotted Ted Cruz vow to reject the Electoral College count make a lot of noise catch Trump’s eye to recognize their loyalty and snap up the Republican presidential nomination for 2024.Chances are Trump will be embroiled neck-deep in a criminal case of his own swamped with future criminal cases and trials and not in a position to give anyone a leg up into the White House.But dumb and dumber are still looking for a wink from the dumbest.Read more by this author:
Monday 4 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/151823/president-trump-supporters-deserting-him-in-droves,President Trump Supporters Deserting Him In Droves,The legions of supporters who stood by President Donald Trump during and after the November presidential election and who have in the face of all sense of reason given him their unquestioned support since his inauguration in January 2017 seem now to have had a change of mind and have started deserting him - in their tens of thousands.The election results showed that although beaten by Joe Biden Trump still had a huge amount of support and his prospects for re-election in 2024 were looking good.Yesterday however after further problems over the stimulus package and after a recording of a phone call asking Georgia state governor to act fraudulently was made public many Trump supporters finally admitted they had 'seen the light' and turned their backs on him.One former Trump voter in New York said:"I put up with his lies and shit for long enough but it's time to be realistic. Trump out!"Another said:"I might be like a sponge who soaks up every bit of crap a man says but even sponges have a limit!"Others felt the same. One woman commented that politics as well as plain and simple human ethics had been dragged through the mud. She asked:"He's told so many lies how do we even know for sure his name's Trump?"

There's no telling whether or not the end of the human race might be nigh though..."
Monday 4 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/151915/joe-biden-a-retro-andy-gump,Joe Biden: A Retro Andy Gump,BILLINGSGATE POST: Daring to be different Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump by presenting himself as a latter-day Andy Gump. Like Gump he has an anterior mandible defect that creates the appearance of an absent chin and lower lip along with a severely retrognathic lower jaw.In layman’s terms this is called the “Andy Gump deformity” and is named for a character in an early 20th century comic strip.Created by the late Sidney Smith like Joe Biden Andy Gump was an utterly ordinary chinless bombastic blowhard. He is henpecked by his wife and has a worthless son who is constantly getting into trouble.The comparisons are endless. In the comic strip Sidney Smith had Andy run for Congress in 1922 and for President in 1924 and in practically every succeeding election. So Sleepy Joe is not the first of many comic strip and cartoon characters to run for office.Dr. Slim: “Ironically in both cases most of the voters are now dead.”Dirty: “Yo Dr. Dude. If only the dead could vote.”

The following year he splashed out again buying an entry-level computer. He now happily entertains himself with on-line games of solitaire chess and Scrabble.The decision to acquire a mobile phone was prompted when Mr Shakespeare began noticing the widespread use of QR scanning codes and the need for a device that could read them. “Since Covid I can’t even go to my local Farmers market coffee shop or cinema without having to scan one of those blasted codes” Mr Shakespeare said. “I’m afraid my little one-man technology protest has now come to an end thanks to these codes. I just can’t keep on ignoring them and still trying to lead an active life.”Shakespeare has until recently worn the title of ‘Luddite’ as a genuine badge of honor. Sources close to him reveal he first acquired his disdain for technology advancements when automation of lighthouses in the late seventies forced him out of the job he had loved for so long. “He never got over that” Mr Shakespeare’s great-grand-niece Shelby Warde revealed.Meanwhile the champagne corks and party streamers continue to pop for a day Archie’s friends relatives and neighbors never thought they’d live to see.“Now he’s got the doorbell computer and phone what’s next for the old guy – a drone?“ quipped next-door neighbor Chris Cross who also claimed Shakespeare’s own father lead the original protest against the tractor when it was first introduced saying it offered little advantage over horses.

Jerry says that after seeing the replay it appears that a Giants linebacker may have used what looked like either a paring knife or perhaps an eggbeater to inflict the injury.He remarked that the darn refs missed the assault along with at least 9 or 14 other plays that went against his team.Jerry said that it was really very hard to see the game on the field. due to the incessant snow flurries that occurred throughout the entire game.After the game the Cowboys owner was asked if he still planned to sell the team.Jones replied that he’d have plenty of time during the off-season to sit down and discuss that matter with his wife Eugenia 76 and his girlfriend Maggie Mickenzipper 29.

It is a go straight to jail crime.Using made-up conspiracy theories and asking the Georgia Secretary of State to "find 11780 more votes"  smacks of fraud by Donald Trump.Miraculously Trump did not threaten to kneecap anyone. Yet.But the recorded telephone conversation was clear. A rambling discourse by Trump of numbers numbers numbers that there were fake votes talk about a water main break votes traveling by suitcases very bad drop boxes dead people voting close to 5000 dead voters stuffed ballot boxes 3000 pounds of shredded ballots that the people of Georgia were angry a new tape was going to be released soon as proof he won the state by hundreds of thousands of votes calling a voter activist a hustler but sounding more like a hustler mob boss con man and sore loser than the president of anything certainly not of the United States.The word 'litigious' entered the telephone conversation as a threat by Mark Meadows Trump’s chief of staff. So Trump wasn’t left alone with the telephone but encouraged to overthrow the election by others.Vice-president-elect Kamala Harris called Trump’s phone call an assault on democracy.Others call it grounds for a second impeachment.Still others called for his resignation.Read more by this author:

He could even be heard humming it in the background as Chris Whitty was speaking at the last televised update.'The aide told us that the recent school closures can be attributed to the song too as Johnson recently announced their total closure after sending them all back for one single day after the Christmas break.'Johnson sprang up during a cabinet meeting' the aide said 'and just started yelling ''Put the school kids in the school kids out. In out in out. Shake them all about. Do the Hokey Cokey then U-turn around that's what I'm all about!''It was crazy he was gurning and giggling like a little girl' he continued.We reached out for comment from the government and are waiting on a response.A spokesperson for the opposition told us: 'I'm not surprised. It makes a lot of sense. I suppose if anything I'm just glad he didn't know ''London's Burning''.'

Others think he is a great man. It is safe to say however that no one thinks of Trump as being introspective. That may be changing however in the waning days of the Trump presidency. Sources tell us that Trump is becoming increasingly reflective as January 20 the day on which Biden will be inaugurated nears.More than anything Trump fears being absolutely alone with himself—with no Twitter; no cheering crowds; no election to contest; no golf; no lackeys to do his bidding; no children to tell him how great he is . . . ; you get the idea—and unable to do anything except engage in some soul-searching. It is not prison or bad health per se that terrifies Trump. It is the fact that as he moves deeper and deeper into the eighth decade of his life he might find himself alone in a cell or hospital room with nothing to divert or distract him from thinking about the person he is and has been.So while it might be a stretch to say that Trump is becoming truly introspective it is not a stretch to say that he is becoming introspective about introspection. Not surprisingly the whole notion terrifies him. Supposedly the poor man has even confided to aides that he’d rather spend eternity on a barren island with Hillary Clinton than spend even a week with nobody and nothing other than himself.

Tuesday 5 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/151921/who-else-did-donald-trump-telephone,Who Else Did Donald Trump Telephone?,Well adding up the numbers Donald Trump would have needed more than just 11780 votes from Georgia to overturn the election.So did Trump also telephone other states? Did he try to coerce other states to find additional votes? Maybe check in the sofas for any lost votes? Or glue together shredded votes to verify signatures?The oops factor: “It’s okay if you announce that you made a mistake and found more votes” said Trump.The threat: “But it could be criminal if your count isn’t correct…” Trump added.Trump’s telephone call to Georgia was based on: “…lots and lots of rumors that I’m hearing from people that are telling me things.”So much for the expertise of the FBI and CIA.Rumors? Lots and lots of rumors? And did other states fail to have the foresight to record his telephone calls?The person Trump should have telephoned for additional votes was Vladimir Putin. Easy peasy! Putin could have run up thousands of Trump voters in a flash.But it was Christopher Krebs to the rescue of Democracy. Krebs the former director of Homeland Cyber Security announced that his agency kept hackers out. Adding the 2020 election was free of foreign interference.Former because sore loser Trump fired Krebs. And Trump is making telephone calls to States begging for additional votes.That won’t get Trump the Nobel Peace Prize. Maybe a Censure Resolution by the House of Representatives and criminal prosecution for attempting to overturn a certified election.But not four more years in the White House.Read more by this author:
Tuesday 5 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/world/151629/man-to-reconsider-the-work-of-sigmund-freud,Man To Reconsider The Work Of Sigmund Freud,A man who fancies himself as a bit of a philosopher and has tried hard to read several books on the subject has said he doesn't agree with everything he has read and is planning his own assessment of the works of the influential Austrian philosopher Sigmund Freud.Moys Kenwood 57 thinks about things a lot and for a long time but cannot get to grips with some of the more complex ideas metaphysical principles and long words in many of the works of philosophy he has so far tackled.He even bought a pocket-size book highlighting the thoughts of Descartes hoping that the smallness of the edition might mean it would be easier to understand.Alas this wasn't the case.It was his experience of Freud however that troubled him most. The philosopher's 'Theory of Psychosexual Development' was very troubling but also his interpretation of the human psyche as being split into three parts - the id the ego and the super-ego - was difficult for Kenwood to accept.He said:"Freud's 'Theory of Psychosexual Development' was very troubling but also his interpretation of the human psyche as being split into three parts - the id the ego and the super-ego - was difficult for me to accept."Specifically said Kenwood the Austrian's ideas about sex were particularly difficult for him to get his head around:"Yes that's right.

Medium Alert High Alert Very High Alert Stay At Home ... I just did as I was told. But I'm not sure I'll be able to cope with any more. I'm really feeling the strain!"The country has undergone various stop-start lockdowns social distancing rules limits on group gatherings and levels of isolation and introduced a 3-tier system which has become a 4-tier system in order to designate which places people are most at risk from the Coronavirus.Miss Gribble who has more than 4000 Facebook friends posted her concerns and innermost feelings onlineand received 3600 likes and 300 'crying faces' in sympathy.But Melissa laughed:"It's fair to say she was reduced to tiers!"

A quite unusual cat called Anton who resides on a farm in the Eifel region in Germany has been spotted dumping his winter fur in winter!Deep snow lying on the ground scattered with balls of fluffy grey fur led the farmer to inspect Anton. After brushing his fur he discovered that due to environmental changes Anton has reacted overly sensitive believing it is May and not freezing January!After a visit to the vet the farmer was told not to worry too much about Anton's loss of fur but advised the farmer to knit him a woolly coat because Anton could end up freezing his 'cojones' off!Another problem could be in summer if Anton grows a new coat of thick winter fur causing him to overheat in the German sunshine. The farmer has come up with a solution for his totally out-of-sync cat; Anton will now have his own personal air conditioning built into the barn where he resides.Other farm cats on the farm who are still in-sync with nature tend to avoid poor Anton believing he is an alien cat and tend to bully him but luckily the farmer's wife spoils him immensely by allowing him a daily bowl of fresh cow's milk before it is transported off to the dairy.The farmer is hoping Anton does not go completely bald because cheeky mice scampering around the barn all called Jerry will roll on their backs laughing when they spot a bald Anton not Tom attempting to catch them.Disney have sent a film crew to the farm after hearing of this unusual specimen and maybe 'Anton The Balding Cat' will one day have the 'last meow and meow loudest!' In addition Elton John cat lover has offered to pay for a special hair piece for Anton as long as it looks like his own!

But when Senator Longerweed pointed out that the revenue from Naked Bingo Night would also allow for every person over the age of 70 to receive free-state-provided dentures as well as a life-time supply of Viagra for men or Cellulite-Be-Gone Salve for women the proposal passed 100-0.

Domestic terrorism is not a joke. What happened at the Capital on January 6th was as serious as 9/11.Donald Trump was directly responsible for what happened 1/6. It was the result of Trump's loss of the 2020 election. His hatred for the principles this nation holds sacred has been demonstrated ever since he came down the escalator.Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley must also be removed from office as both encouraged this domestic terrorism violence and death. The two were grandstanding in their attempt to gain recognition for the 2024 presidential election.The list of Ivy League schools attended by both indicates that both occupied seats absorbing nothing and used those degrees as a stepping stone in their ambitious climb toward the White House.“Grab a woman by the pussy”? That’s where their IQ remains.Screw the Constitution. We are better than people of color. Make America White Again.Josh Hawley clerked for Supreme Court Justice Roberts. Wow! He even taught at Oxford.The train station in Oxford is pretty much always crowded. Trains come and go delivering people and taking people away. The town has a Starbucks and 45 colleges. You get to Oxford from Paddington Station in London. Anyone can lecture from a teacher’s manual. Hawley was not Jesus Christ Muhammad or Buddha.A Mexican field worker has more love and respect for the United States of America than was demonstrated by Trump Cruz and Hawley. These workers earn their money with backbreaking work and are in the US for the money and knowledge of the justice this nation holds dear.Donald Trump Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley have defiled the justice found in the Constitution and must be held accountable.They should be removed from their office today.Read more by this author:

Sadly it seems as though evil dictators like Napoleon tend to come back and haunt the world in reincarnated versions.For example:Little Brit Hitler Oswald Mosley certainly walks the planet now as Nigel Farage who jumps into bed with any populist politician whose butt is available!Stalin has certainly been reincarnated as Putin a modern version who 'digs' the rich and famous lifestyle like all dictators tend to do. Only difference is he hides behind the cloak of a so-called Russian democracy waiting to pounce like a hungry giant grizzly bear when the time is right!Hitler the real thing who actually served in the German army during the 1914-1918 war has obviously jumped into the head of 'yellow-belly' ex-President T***P. His instigation yesterday of a copy of Napoleon's coup d’état in 1799 failed because T***p is a military dodo and his strategy of rousing up a bunch of racist rednecks to storm US Congress was typical of a low-level ignoramus and certainly not a military leader!

World power Iran sounded its concern at seeing its political rival slip into mob rule and despotism. “We appeal to the people of the USA not to use violence but to return home and obey the rule of law” the Ayatollah tweeted. The North Korean government similarly called for peace in America and for the extremists to surrender or be harmlessly apprehended.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson who recently won a hat-trick of victories with his election as leader of the ruling Conservative Party his landslide win in the UK general election and his Brexit deal with the EU called the mobs deplorable. Trump’s British cheerleader Nigel Farage was nowhere to be seen presumably self-isolating or something.Meanwhile in scenes reminiscent of a 70s Dick Dastardly cartoon President Trump called on Vice President Mike Pence "Muttley DO something" as his hopes of clinging to power evaporated. Trump wants Pence to overturn the election not accepting that he doesn't have the power to do that while the rest of the country wants Pence to use his powers under the 25th Amendment to remove the President from office.

The United States Supreme Court in emergency session ruled in a 6-3 decision a few minutes ago that the United States Congress in joint session as constitutionally required had failed to certify the vote of the Electoral College vote and therefore the election was null and void. The court did not indicate what course of action should now be followed to rectify that failure but the implication was that any attempt by the Congress to reconvene for such certification would also be null and void.President Donald Trump immediately tweeted that he will remain as president following the end of his current term on January 20.

We realise the imposition we are putting people under but just staying indoors won't suffice. We feel that staying in bed will be the only way to arrest the virus in its tracks."Ministers acting on the advice of scientists who don't appear to have a clue about what they are doing have zig-zagged and backtracked through the nine months of the crisis changing their minds as often as their socks and generally making things as confused as they could possibly become.They have also succeeded through their strange decisions on who is an essential worker and who is not of forcing many into poverty and with a mass of misinformation and questionable statistics have driven a wedge between millions who through their understandable fear believe they are in peril and those who wouldn't trust politicians as far as they could throw one.Said Hancock:"We have plans for some more tiers up ahead but for now just stay in bed. And under the duvet if possible."

Hillary Clinton?”Ms. Pelosi hemmed and hawed and instead took on the question of why she used the language “concedes.”"I had thought maybe we should up the punishment to being shot at dawn by a group of marines on the White House lawn but then I saw Mr. Schumer's idea as superior and conceded to it."."We need to return to the 13th century."In medieval times punishment for sedition meant being drawn on a board to a place of execution hanged then quartered into four sections. These parts were then publicly displayed as a warning.Next Ms. Pelosi was asked why she had pointed to the capitol riots as evidence of Mr. Trump's seeking armed sedition to overthrow the US government in a coup."There were weapons here and there. Plus his mouth. Need I say more?"This although Mr. Trump implored the rioters to be peaceful and to go home.Indeed some commentators say that whatever Trump's responsibility was in the first place the Democrats hold share due to their actions in a problematic election.Further questioned why these capitol riots were not okay whereas Democrats supported BLM and antifa rioting in the summer Ms. Pelosi answered:“Those riots in the summer occurred as a demonstration of free speech against abuses. In Mr. Trump's case there are no abuses just pure sedition.”“We Democrats are as pure as the driven snow on this matter.”Asked if maybe not quite so pure--Are there not additional to questions on the election problems of economic inequality plus a drastic Democratic controlled “solution” to current virus problems she replied:“Irrelevant.”Further on the “quartering” aspect of Mr. Schumer's idea for eliminating the president:Mr. Trump's head should be clad in a red MAGA hat with tongue protruding from the right side of his mouth.“And we will begin this exhibition in Portland Oregon I think” Ms. Pelosi stated.

And Ted the King of All the Child Things was lonely and wanted to be where someone loved him best of all.Then far away from his deeply red district he smelled 2024 so he gave up being King of Where the Child Things Are.But the child things cried "Oh please don't go--we'll eat you up--we love you so!" And Ted said "Well OK . . . ."The child things roared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth and waved their red MAGA hats and showed their terrible claws but Ted stepped into his limousine and waved good-bye and drove to his deeply red district to his very own room where he found his supper waiting for him and it was still like his core values lukewarm.

Friday 8 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/151960/blubbering-donald-trump-says-he-won-t-attend-joe-biden-s-inauguration,Blubbering Donald Trump says he won’t attend Joe Biden’s inauguration,In a tweet to his sycophantic followers the grizzling groucher President Trump has said he won’t go to the inauguration of President Elect Biden.Biden who kicked Trump’s ass in the recent US presidential election takes over in the White House on 20 January and until now Trump has said he wouldn’t leave. However all that changed after thousands of his ardent followers armed with guns and knives and pipe bombs attacked Washington destroyed buildings and killed police officers. While Trump’s daughter thanked them and called them patriots and Trump wished them well most decent Americans expressed horror resulting in demands for Vice President Mike Pence to utilize the 25th Amendment and kick his boss out of power.Despite being mocked and ridiculed by POTUS and despite demands for him to be charged with treason Pence has ruled out using the 25th Amendment to oust Trump but it is believed that he may have demanded in return that Trump leaves the White House willingly on 20 January which a Trumpian aide said he would do.This will be a disappointment to many observers who were looking forward to seeing the petulant POTUS being caried kicking and screaming through the doors of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue by Secret Service agents before being unceremoniously dropped on the sidewalk.Scottish Prime Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said that Trump can’t enter her country to play golf on one of his golf courses which he had hoped to use as an excuse for avoiding Biden’s inauguration. The Scottish leader told Trump to “grow a set of balls and attend the inauguration”.Meanwhile Russian President Vlad (the Poisoner) Putin has offered sanctuary to Donald Trump on condition that he brings with him as much information as possible about America’s security systems.
Friday 8 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/151958/president-trump-has-had-his-bum-slapped,President Trump Has Had His Bum Slapped,President Donald Trump who on Wednesday incited his supporters to march on Capitol Hill to regain his 'stolen presidential election' showed his sensible side today condemning their actions and promising a smooth handover of power on 20 January.Clearly he'd had his bum smacked.Trump who has tried every trick in the book to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the 3 November vote wound thousands of his supporters up on Thursday and pointed them in the direction of Congress and the rest as we know is catastrophic history.Today however Trump did a complete 180-degree about turn and condemned the riot he'd organized - indeed which would not have happened without him.He said:"I wanna say I condone the riots. I mean that is I condemn the riots. What we need right now is eating and resuscitation. I mean healing and reconciliation."Contradicting his previous day's criticism like someone who behaves in a certain way dependant upon which side of the bed he gets out of Trump had obviously been given a good talking to by senior Republicans who must have been worried that their own political futures were too closely intertwined with his.One source said:"The guy is a grade-A fruitcake. He's a real threat to the future of US politics. Someone has finally told the moron to shut the fuck up and reminded him about what happened to JFK."
Friday 8 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/151497/president-donald-trump-says-you-aint-seen-nothing-yet,President Donald Trump Says "You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet!",He may have less than two weeks of his time in the White House left but President Donald J. Trump earlier today struck terror into the hearts of every right-minded person in the US and in the wider world.Trump appeared briefly on the White House lawn to deliver his reaction to being banned from prominent social media platforms and crooning the anthemic refrain from the 1974 Bachman-Turner Overdrive hit record declared:"You ain't seen nothing yet!"After the frightening scenes on the steps of Capitol Hill on Wednesday when demonstrators stormed and occupied the building in what Joe Biden described as 'an insurrection' and others as 'the end of democracy' this latest statement was most unwelcome.Quite what Trump meant by "You ain't seen nothing yet!" isn't clear and can only be guessed at. But bearing in mind all that has gone before during his four years in charge nothing should be ruled out.With certain sections of the populace having already come into conflict during riots last year threatening a Race War and those at opposite ends of another societal spectrum - the rich and the poor - threatening a Class War Trump's incendiary comments at a time when people are 'on edge' over the Coronavirus appear to be those of a man attempting to cause a Civil War.There are 11 full days between now and Joe Biden taking the reins and President Trump reminded everyone just how long 11 days is by reiterating:"No no baby you ain't seen nuthin' yet!"

Once cleared she returned to carry on with the certification of the 2020 Presidential Election.She calmly stood there and carried on.In the face of battle Trump claimed bone spurs.Too cowardly to carry on his own fight on 1/6 Trump spurred on his fanatic followers. No one asked: "Hey why does our leader come out wearing an overcoat and gloves tell us to carry on his fight promise to march with us then retreat into the White House to watch us on television?"Good question!Connect the dots. Does Trump's mob of domestic terrorists believe Trump would ever allow them to set foot on his Mar-A-Lago sanctuary?Why do the fight when you can get someone else to fight for you? Or let the suckers do it.He referred to soldiers who died defending Democracy as suckers and losers. A different battle but Donald Trump uses domestic terrorists as his suckers and losers.Trump’s terrorists knew exactly how to locate Speaker Pelosi’s office. How? They vandalized her office ripping it apart with a vengeance. Those terrorists would have carried out Trump's most vindictive and irrational orders if she had not been in a secure location. When caught they would have said that they were only following orders.Pelosi was the single highest elected official who stood up to Trump again and again and again defining him as the cowardly incompetent that he was."All roads lead to Putin."Donald Trump claimed bone spurs many years ago.Today the world recognizes him as a coward.Read more by this author:

Metro Police where no better as they were actually one step below forest rangers.Nobody in the three eastern terrorist groups can figure out why the Anarchist-in-Chief Donald “Pussy Face” Trump did not call in the National Guard to take back the Capitol Building.Meanwhile little 6-year-old Timmy Fizzifu reportedly looked up at his daddy and asked “Daddykins could it perhaps be due to the fact that the National Guard would have been fighting against Trump the Chump’s own anarchist solders?”

Faced with a divided nation of 75 million voters who prefer to eat pasta at the Olive Tree rather than the French Laundry where elites like to gather to thwart COVID-19 restrictions they themselves imposed President-elect Biden announced that on the first day of his presidency he would form a Thunk Control Agency.Now that both Facebook and Twitter have suspended the accounts of President Trump and anyone who has the temerity to agree with him Biden understands that there is no one left to stop him from going one step further.Ironically Biden who has been known to steal a thought or two will not be affected by his new agency. When probed to elaborate on any of his pre-packaged speeches he throws up his arms and with a mischievous grin he says:“Leave me alone guys I’m trying to think but nothing happens.”Dr. Slim: “Ain’t that line from Curly of The Three Stooges?”Dirty: “Yo Dude.

He is the worst most incompetent president in the history of US presidents but that being said he is the best there has ever been in that field."Twitter reacted to the President's incitement of his followers to go down to Capitol Hill by announcing that the platform had permanently suspended his account.Mr. Trump also seemed to have finally accepted that Mr. Biden had won the election and promised a smooth handover of power.Mr. Biden said:"I think it was a good idea of the President to incite his supporters to insurrection. It's the end of his political career and of his Twitter account."
Saturday 9 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/151962/trump-uses-taxpayer-s-money-to-pay-for-his-latest-portrait,Trump Uses Taxpayer’s Money to Pay for His Latest Portrait,It was revealed today that the outgoing self-proclaimed greatest-ever American president Donald Trump has spent $2bn of US taxpayers’ money on a portrait of himself. The portrait was commissioned yesterday evening and was completed within fifteen minutes by New York sidewalk portrait artist Iva Daub4U.The artist famous for drinking her own turpentine while she paints allowed selected journalists a glimpse of the completed work currently hanging on the wall of her basement public restroom home beneath Penn station.The lucky members of the press pack afforded this privilege were charged an entry fee of $2 each to view the portrait a fee that also included a free go on the urinal of their choice. (Could mortal man ask for more?)After the viewing the press pack unanimously described the portrait as ‘total shite.’ The news that the painting was funded with an obscene amount of public money added further insult to injury. It’s understood that Trump commissioned the portrait via a third party company ‘Ivanka & Jared’s Pop-Up Portraits.’ It’s further understood that the commissioning company retained the lion’s share of the fee. The actual final payment given to the artist was a mere $2 plus a gallon of methylated spirits.However not everybody shares the same sentiment about the portrait as the journalists. The subject himself Trump was quick to praise the enterprise describing the painting as ‘evocative.’“I’m delighted with it” crowed Trump “I think it captures the warrior in me. Not only do I look tough hunky and like sex-on-legs but I look almost as handsome as I do in real life. I’ll bet there’ll be a few juicy moments for the ladies when it goes on display at the Metropolitan.”Trump then went on to describe the circumstances of how the idea came to him of how he should be depicted in the picture.“I don’t know if anyone noticed but I held a little rally in Washington last Wednesday” said the President. “It wasn’t a big affair just a few loyal friends. I made a little speech to them about how I believe Biden won fair and square and how I was looking forward to peacefully handing over power to his administration. I also told them I was looking forward to putting my feet up playing a little more golf perhaps or maybe volunteering to help out on the Covid wards at my local hospital in Palm Beach. I happened to notice a quiet guy standing at the front holding a spear with a stars and striped nailed to it. There he was dressed just like I am in the portrait. Now isn’t that a coincidence!”The President then added “I may have inadvertently mentioned that the election was a complete fraud and disgusting people were robbing them of their true president the greatest man ever in the history of mankind… that’s me of course. I also may have let it slip out that it might not be a bad idea to march down to Capitol Hill and bust up the place a little. I never thought for one moment these patriots these very special people would actually do such a thing.You can imagine how I felt later when I found out after they’d trashed the place they all turned out to be ultra-right wing redneck shit-for-brains thugs. Who’d have thought that? I was so distressed I was too upset to call in the National Guard. That white-haired traitor who works for me had to do it.”It is understood that VP-elect Kamala Harris has been tasked with listing all the abuses of power corruption and other crimes committed by Trump and his cohorts so that criminal proceedings can be brought once Trump is finally kicked out. In a short statement today on the subject of the portrait she said “This has to be top of the list. Have you seen the f*cking thing?”

Just 'take it as it comes' don't plan anything be spontaneous and see what happens at the end of the night.""Yes that's right" agreed Sandra "but this virus thing has got us all of a muddle and there we were in the middle of our little group in the pub on Friday night and before I had time to stop myself I'd said that I wouldn't mind one bit if Jack 'slipped me a length' on Sunday night straight after 'Match of the Day' and our cocoa. Gosh!"Friends of the pair were startled. One Mike Ramrod said:"It was quite out of character really to spill the beans on their 'in-out-in-out' plans. Still the virus seems to be messing with our brains!"And Jenny Boggins who - secretly - wouldn't mind if Mike slipped her a length laughed:"I'll be at home but I'll be there with them in spirit!"

Google says that states authorize private citizens to make arrests if the suspect (Donald Trump in this case) has committed a high crime or misdemeanor or is in the process of committing a felony.Donald Trump incited the invasion of the Capitol. Four people were killed leaders of Congress threatened with death the building vandalized the Constitution desecrated. Certainly the actions of January 6 qualify for a citizen's arrest of the instigator.Google didn't explain but by 'any private citizen' it could be a White House maid one of the kitchen staff a gardener or Hillary Clinton.Lastly could January 6 have been a practice run for January 20?Read more by this author:

This was useful information and he bore it in mind just in case he ever wanted to bond someone's skin or eyes together.The sweet aroma of the solvent was now swimming around his head making him both relaxed and at the same time alert and aware of the buzzing caused by the wings of a fly that had landed on the table six feet away.He felt like he could see yesterday today and tomorrow all at the same time.He wondered how this mystical experience might be enhanced using several tubes of the glue or one big tub of it.He imagined a giant 1-kilogram tub placed in a plastic bag big enough so that he could also insert his head to inhale the 'friendly fumes'.As he did he realized that his fingers and thumb had become affixed to the tube and a frantic period of 'separation' ensued.The potential new hobby is still under consideration.

This comes after years of erratic behavior by his parents including his soon-to-be-unemployed father.“The environment that this young man was living in was terrible” stated Jennifer Glim of FCPS. “He was living in a house filled with rage sycophancy and delusion. This is no environment for a child to develop in.”“We looked into having him stay with relatives but it turned out that option was just as bad. His adult brothers and sisters all exhibited the same problems as his parents.”“Foster care is meant to be a temporary situation. We always hope that the parents can get back on their feet and have their child returned to them but in this case the father seemed unaware of the fact the child had ever even lived with him” said Glim.

Money.Money in the form of bail money and lawyers’ fees. William Barr is kind of removed from the picture having quit just in time and Giuliani can’t defend all of them.

According to various sources the spy agency used advanced algorithms to track down the source of wild and insane conspiracies--including the incredibly stupid lie that Trump is secretly fighting a cabal of satanic pedophiles inside the government the media and Hollywood elites."We used sleuth investigative techniques but the real break came from a tip" said CIA Director Porter Goss. Crime fighting takes community support and not surprisingly the mysterious "Q" was unmasked by Shiv Aalok a tipster vacationing in Maunabo Puerto Rico.During a Zoom interview Shiv Aalok acknowledged his role. As many will remember Shiv is the same taxi driver who discovered President Trump's missing tax returns in the back of his Uber in 2017.According to Shiv "I came to Maunabo for sun and fun and was drinking Puerto Rican rum in the plaza with some local drunks. I noticed they all drink Don "Q" rum. So I asked who is Don "Q"? The drunks said Don "Q" is the competitor to Bacardi and was losing a lot of money so to drum up business he began putting stupid rumors on bottles that could be read only after the bottle was empty.

All I have to do is avoid Friday nights on BBC1 and not watch anything on Dave and I think I will be fine for the year'.

After having his first choice for Secretary of Defense General Lloyd J Austin III dumped for being part of the feared Industrial-Military Complex President-Elect Joe Biden nominated his second choice Major Amos B Hoople to fill this important post.Major Hoople who has never held a position of this magnitude is considered a compromise choice. Once known for being an integral part of the last bulwark of defense against the encroaching Bolshevik hordes he drifted into the fickle fog of obscurity once the Soviet Union fell into the dustbin of history.Given to lengthy speeches Major Hoople is known to use near-archaic expressions like “EGAD” and “DRAT”. The Major is often heard mouthing such non-words as “FAP” “AWP” and “KAFF”. His favored mode of communication is long-winded discourses about his astonishing experiences mostly lies that nobody takes seriously; making him the perfect choice for the position because he mirrors the President-Elect.With these credentials it is almost a mortal lock that House Speaker Nancy Poozleosi will proceed with forcing her fellow Democrats to approve of him.Dr. Slim: "It’s about time that Major Hoople got his chance to dismantle the military."Dirty: "Yo Dude. His motto is: 'Smoke this asshole.'"

He is a straight-up character polite well-mannered withdrawn one might even say 'a loner' and he certainly keeps himself to himself. There's really no reason for anyone to give him the evil eye but they do."But according to staff at the office Mr. Harvey-Oswald isn't alone. Others have reported feeling intimidated after suffering various degrees of verbal abuse there.Arnold Todd Ronnie Crapper Edward Youbend Dick Strappon and 21-year-old Jack Chithouse have all asked staff if they could just report to the desk without having their names called but staff have insisted there are rules that must be adhered to."There are rules that must be adhered to" insisted clerical officer Jeff Kaye.

Still Donald Trump keeps finding new ways of letting everyone know that Satan-worshiping communists stole the election."I was skeptical when the President suggested visiting a local kindergarten and informing his potential voters about devil’s servants in the Democratic party" said one of the White House aides who kindly agreed to a phone interview. "In my opinion 4-year-old children might have difficulties understanding the concept of elections. Still the President has a way of convincing people to get along with his insane ideas.""When we entered the kindergarten the children reacted the way we expected them to do with the combination of fear and anticipation. The President somehow managed to relax them by pretending to be one of them. He was making inarticulate sounds and saying things like “That’s my toy give it back.”""And then he suddenly started dancing with his fists clenched and ranting about unrelated topics like Hillary Hugo Chavez disinfectant and the Chinese virus. The President frequently used the word "tremendous".""You could see that the children were having a good time many of them started giggling. And when he shouted ”and then they stole the election” the room exploded. The kids just couldn't take it anymore. They were laughing even screaming with laughter and pointing their little fingers at the President. The secret service agents quickly reacted and dragged him to the car.""While we were driving back to the White House the President suggested that we should go to the Rockies where he could stand at the top of the mountain and shout "stop the steal!"""And listening to the echo of his own voice."

Trump are still recovering from a shock caused by the news of an unjustified and brutal Twitter ban. If only they knew that the President and what’s left of his staff have been working on creative and innovative ways of reaching a wider conservative audience!Donald Trump was unavailable for a comment but one of his few remaining advisers agreed to share the latest news from the Oval Office.“The President couldn’t believe it when he heard the news about the Twitter ban. He was restless walking up and down the office and mumbling something to himself” he said. “Then he suddenly stopped and smiled: “Wait a minute Twitter is not the only platform out there is it?”“One of my colleagues immediately recalled the results of the poll conducted several years ago by GOP which indicate that many humble God-fearing conservative voters frequently visit porn sites especially the giant of the business the PornHub.”“We rolled our sleeves up sat around the desk and spent hours brainstorming possible pseudonyms for the President. The ideas were flying around from Ilovechinabut to realpussygrabberdon but we eventually settled for titsassdonIwon. You see the name shouldn't raise suspicion about who is behind it otherwise we’d be in danger of being banned from PornHub too. Still it should be fairly recognizable to our quick-minded supporters.”“You might wonder why I’m telling you this. Well by the time you publish the article we will change the pseudonym. Our plan is to change it several times a day for security reasons.“Let’s hope this works otherwise we’ll have to communicate with supporters using smoke signals. Inconvenient except for those boys who stormed the Capitol wearing animal skins.”

Although they did admit "we rushed the first batches and maybe our production lines could have got muddled up during the mixing phase!"One UK patient 98-year-old Fred Frump from Warrington who has used his 'thing' for the last 30 years solely to answer the 'call of nature' after downing 5 pints of best British Bitter (enough to make anybody pee!) was delighted after his nurse bent over the bed and he 'rapidly stiffly reacted!' He decided to gently stroke her tasty firm rump!She didn't mind because she thought it was a horny student doctor standing behind her measuring Fred's over-heating temperature and she fancied him anyway! This happened with several over 90's male patients and now doctors have become suspicious that the first vaccines have contents of another 'life saving medicine' Viagra!Pfizer are willing to take the first doses back and replace them with 'non-contaminated' batches to test if there is a valid argument. However over 85-year-old male protestors in UK nursery homes are blocking exits with their wheelchairs demanding the Covid-19 vaccines stay put!!As for over 85-year-old female nursery home patients they hope Pfizer can produce a batch with 'contaminated female Viagra' because a bit of 'slap and tickle' during lockdown could alleviate their boredom!More as we fondle 'It'!

He also asked me to piss all over the carpet but I thought that was taking things a bit too far."Mr. Dummkopf was identified from internet images and has been fired by his company ACME Toilet Brushes Inc.President Trump denies ever having spoken to an American.
Monday 11 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/151820/misled-man-gets-fooled-again,Misled Man Gets Fooled Again!,A local man known for being somewhat oblivious was overheard saying in obvious frustration "I won't get fooled again!" creating panic in a small Idaho town. The man known to townspeople only as "Junior" exited a popular café and reportedly made the statement loud enough for everybody at a nearby gas pump to hear."Frankly it shocked me" said one witness. "Junior doesn't usually pay much attention to anything at all." He went on to describe Junior as pretty much to himself and a loner. "He doesn't say much. Plays a mean pinball though."Bubba O'Reilly owner of the corner gas station that also has an adjacent all-you-can-eat catfish café heard the commotion and came out to investigate. "He was just in here eating!" Bubba told the gathering crowd. "He was sitting right over there quiet as usual. I wonder what made him go off like that?" he wondered aloud as the crowd grew uneasy.Rumors quickly ran rampant through the rural community. No one could recall a time in all these years when Junior expressed even the most remote sense of irritation or ire."This was a tough year for sure but If things are starting to make Junior lose it like that who's next?" said a near-hysterical older lady who claimed to have been Junior's junior high school German teacher.She was uncertain in what year Junior graduated. Some say he may have gone away to college but there is general confusion as to where or when he returned.Faced with sudden uncertainty about Junior and his motives people panicked. "Who knows what he'll do next? We don't know what it's like to be the bad man!" said one sad old man. "He's got that crazy flipper finger!" warned another from the rear.A recently graduated reporter for the weekly rural newspaper looking for clicks heard about the ruckus and drove there to investigate. He initially described the scene as "retarded beyond belief" before editing his Twitter statement with "chaotic"."Mere words cannot describe the scope of this inane bullshit" he tweeted as he tried to get a handle on the metaphysical mayhem. And the center of this psychic shitstorm appeared to be someone named "Junior".Descriptions of Junior were as inconsistent as they were incoherent. He always parted his hair on the left although some said on the right. Others said he grew a beard overnight. Maybe these people were just hypnotized but the hypnotized never lie. Do they?The reporter tracked down Junior at a Motel 6 along the highway west out of town about 200 feet from the scene of the crisis. He approached one room in particular and knocked. The door opened.There stood a tall man in the shadows like another crazy bastard out of the X-Files rolling a joint with one hand as he pulled the curtains apart with the other peering outside.""Junior?" the reporter asked. "That's what they call me" he replied lighting up."So what's going on in town?" the reporter queried. " Hell I don't know. I don't even know these people" 'Junior' replied. "They've been calling me that since I got here."The real Junior supposedly left town in the late 90s to join the Air Force before retiring to design video games. He never returned although none of the townsfolk apparently ever knew he had left. Junior was mostly to himself.This imposter "Junior" was one Gunter Chang a field environmental contractor who only recently arrived in town on a mining waste remediation project. "I kept telling them they need to move and they just kept on telling me 'Stop funning Junior!' This water makes Flint Michigan's look like Perrier" he explained with a gesture of futility.When asked about his 'rampage' at the café Chang explained that the Bubba O'Reilly all-you-can-eat catfish special for $9.99 was fraudulent."Why is that?" asked the reporter."I could only eat $2's worth!" Chang explained. As the reporter chuckled it gradually became apparent that this was not a joke. "I asked for $7.99 back" Chang continued."How'd that work out?" asked the reporter biting his tongue. "He refused!" Chang exclaimed apparently surprised. "Usually they just laugh and humor me"."Are you sure you're not from around here?" the reporter noted aloud as Chang's catfish crusade continued."I just wasn't going to be fooled into eating $9.99 worth again! The illusion of choice is like their new tarter sauce: no choice at all.""Why's that?" the reporter played the straight man."Eat the new sauce and you quickly discover it's the same as the old sauce" he said."It was well worth the trip just for that pearl of wisdom" the reporter exclaimed with faux exuberance."Don't patronize me" Chang warned as the reporter rubbed the back of his neck nervously."It's just that you appear less concerned about a tainted water supply than you do about the cost of your buffet" the reporter confessed."I checked off the 'public notification' box and moved on. Besides they're digging pits and roasting pigs right where we're digging! So I just go with it. Believe me it's easier that way when you're on a schedule. You've talked to them right?" Chang defended his position."Has it ever occurred to you that the mining waste ends up the same place as your catfish?" the reporter queried. Chang pondered the answer and did not like it replying rhethorically "Shouldn't you be storming Area 51 or something?""No we're storming The Capital this week" the reporter never missed a beat quickly wrapping up the interview as Chang screamed incomprehensively after him "I'm done talking to you! No wait I'm not done talking to you yet!"The reporter thought the people had a right to know everything and the next morning he took everything he had to the authorities.Hours later sheriff deputies burst into the motel to put an end to the nightmare that had gripped this community. As they led "Junior" out in cuffs he smiled and winked at the reporter. "You did what you had to do to save these rubes" he said."I don't know these people. Actually this is a pot bust" said the reporter. "Idaho has no medical or recreation use Mr. Chang. If that's really your name Catfish! Who are you?""Hold on! You went with a nickel and dime pot bust story over an environmental catastrophe?" Chang asked incredulously."Fooled you!" said the reporter. "Crime stories are more popular than the environment. And it's all about the clicks!" the reporter remarked nonchalantly.Chang hung his head. "Dammit! Looks like I got fooled again! I guess I had that coming though" Chang said."Don't make me the bad man here! Maybe you shouldn't be going all around town causing a big sensation then trying to put me d-d-down!" the reporter remarked defensively."Because you haven't been around!" Chang snapped before being led away by the deputy. "Simmer down and get in the cruiser Junior.""I hope your dreams aren't as empty as your conscious seems to be" Chang challenged his morality with vengeance."My dreams are fine" said the reporter looking down at his phone. "It's my generation baby!"

"I shook hands with a keeper who was tested as asymptomatic and his glove came off in my hand. That's where we got it.""You spent too long picking that glove to pieces" said another of the gorillas."Yeah but I don't know about that test. He had no symptoms they say. Are we that weak?""Yes" said another."All this captivity around humans" from yet another."And look how weak they are! Sniffles and they have an epidemic!""Okay" (from Albert again) "now that we've made it into the news along with Brother Donald and Sister Nancy I figure we just sit back and heal.""No big" one of them said."And if Governor Nuisance--did I say Nuisance? I meant Newsom!--stops by hell I'll give him a hug as well as a handshake.""No he won't. The 120-mile limit you know. If that applies to him that is.""Well then I'll blow him a kiss.""You hear that siren Albert? You just brought Twitter Zoo News down on us! Accounts suspended! Watch your mouth!"
Tuesday 12 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/152003/better-explanations-for-what-happened-on-6-january-2021,Better Explanations for what Happened on 6 January 2021,Despite the nonstop footage dedicated to the recent spectacle at the U.S. Capitol there is much more to the story than we have been told. We should by now know at least two things about Donald Trump: The first of course is that he lacks a moral compass but the second is that he is not stupid. If he had really orchestrated last week’s events we would have to conclude that he is beyond stupid.Clearly someone else masterminded the nonsense about overturning the election and we are working to track down two possibilities both of which play into Trump’s incredible angst about going to prison once he is out of office. In other words what drove Trump to do what he did is not his distress at losing the presidency but his fear of prison. One might think that his recent behavior only increased this possibility but that is not necessarily the case as we will see.We have previously reported that Trump might take asylum in Russia (“Donald Trump’s Last Big Deal”) in the near future. If this is the case the whole election challenge charade may have been orchestrated by Vladimir Putin in an effort to further divide the United States and embarrass it on the world stage. Trump in other words did what he did on orders from Putin. That would be Trump’s treasonous quid pro quo for Putin’s promise of asylum a generous allowance and a bevy of gorgeous Russian babes in Moscow.Another possibility is that one of the Democratic dirty tricks operatives (think of this one as a Democratic Roger Stone with a much higher IQ) came up with a diabolical plan to give the Democrats control of the Senate and divide the Republican Party. In this scenario--which unfolded with the full knowledge of President-elect Biden--Trump has been promised that he will not be prosecuted if he contested the election in the way that he did. Biden in the name of restoring unity will before too long pardon Trump for any federal crimes he may have committed and will call off the state Attorney Generals who would like to prosecute Trump for other crimes that he may have committed.Things are likely to get even more interesting in the coming weeks and we will keep you posted.

Public. Trump replied that he may run for governor of Alabama where he says 102% of the people love him and even refer to him as "Masser Donald."Putin told POTUS that he wants him to join him in Russia and he’ll appoint him to his Communist cabinet and make him Comrade Secretary of Golf.Trump reportedly got so excited that he literally peed in his golf pants. He told Vlady he’d gladly accept the job. He even asked if he could bring his favorite child Ivanka with him.The Anarchist-in-Chief asked Putin if they had a McDonalds in Moscow. He was told they did and let out a scream of joy that would make a fucking banshee proud.Meanwhile Melania Trump told CNN's Don Lemon that she wouldn’t move to Russia for all the damn cottonpickin' cotton in Mississippi.

This comes as tech firms Apple and Google have pulled the app from their app stores and Amazon Web Services has terminated the company's hosting services leaving them without any ability to host their services on the internet due to Parler's lack of attention to continued warnings by these companies for violating terms of service in their contracts particularly involving the continued presence of violent calls to action.  According to one GOP representative Devin Nunes (R-CA) "Republicans have no way to communicate! I have three million followers on Parler. Tonight I will no longer be able to communicate with those people.”One solution would have been for these people to join and communicate via other popular social media sites such as Facebook or Twitter who have much stricter codes of conduct. However Parler was created as an alternative for members who had already been banned by these other social media sites for hate speech violent threats and actions and the encouragement of violence.Faced with no alternatives the GOP has had to turn to the United States Postal Service for assistance in utilizing physical mailers to reach their followers. This comes after the GOP originally spent months dismantling sorting machines all in the hopes of preventing mail-in ballots from arriving in time for elections around the nation in November."I'd encourage them to remember that sending these types of vile useless things through the mail are indeed... mail fraud" said one local postman who goes simply by the name of Newman."Let them eat stamps!" said another postal worker who requested to remain anonymous.In one other instance senator Ted Cruz attempted to recruit a flock of carrier pigeons to deliver his messages to his followers and vice versa. After not hearing from them for a few days the senator became concerned about what had happened to these messages. Three hours later he says he received a visit from the FBI for continued incitement of insurrection.Senator Cruz is currently being held without bond until a trial date is set. It is expected that the carrier pigeons will testify against Cruz according to a jackass familiar with the matter.

Wednesday 13 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/152010/could-donald-trump-end-up-in-jail,Could Donald Trump End Up In Jail?,Curious minds are asking whether Donald Trump could actually end up in jail. There are videos of Trump speaking in front of the White House urging the crowd to march down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol Building and take the country back.And they marched in their thousands up the steps breaking through windows and doors resulting in five people killed police beaten lives threatened many hiding behind barricaded doors furniture destroyed technical equipment stolen personal items taken.The building was vandalized.The plan was to hang Vice President Mike Pence and assassinate Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.Seems all of this started two months ago in November when Trump lost the 2020 presidential election. Sore loser he claimed the election was stolen. Taking his claim to several courts they all disagreed.However Trump managed to convince his followers and they agreed: Yes sir that election was stolen. So they marched and the riot followed.Now Trump is thinking of pardoning himself. Can’t kill someone and then say “Pardon me.”Soon Donald Trump might be separated from his family and put in a cage with a concrete floor. Good-bye golden toilet hello stainless steel relief station.Unlike the children separated from their parents at the border at least Donald Trump's family will know where he is located that he is alive and he is sheltered.Read more by this author:
Wednesday 13 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/world/151863/missing-brexit-voting-slips-found,Missing Brexit Voting Slips Found,There was a major talking point brewing this evening after refuse collectors in London found an undisclosed number of EU referendum voting slips dumped in fourteen black plastic dustbin liners outside the home of former prime minister Theresa May.Police who were called to the scene estimated that there may be as many as 10 million voting slips in the sacks.This could be important for the whole Brexit affair with many experts saying that depending on the results of an authentication check a second referendum could be needed.Britain left the EU on 1 January so a 'remain' vote in any second referendum might cause some slight problems not least amongst the electorate themselves.It's not known why the sacks were left at the location so near to Mrs. May's residence but political analysts have said it might have been better to have had a small bonfire every night.

Having secured its possession he thrust it into his trouser pocket for later use.He said:"I don't usually have much luck with money so this was a welcome find. Maybe it heralds a change in my fortunes."Having said this he reflected out loud for a moment that his good fortune had been someone else's loss but this slight doubt lasted only briefly and he gave a sigh.Kenwood says he has no plans as yet with regard to what he will spend the cash on.* Today's currency exchange rate between the US dollar and the Cambodian riel is $1 = 4100 riel

She says she headed for the door and left the president of the USA on the floor whimpering like the little loser pussy he has now become.
Wednesday 13 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152007/trump-to-send-angry-mob-to-stop-impeachment-effort,Trump To Send Angry Mob To Stop Impeachment Effort,Washington D.C. - Sources close to President Orange Turd say that he is planning to send a second angry mob to the U.S. Capitol Building to try and stop Congress's 2nd impeachment effort on him this week."He's pretty sure it will work this time too" explained Tyler Schitferbrains the acting secretary for pretty much all the government agencies without secretaries. "You see the President is a numbers man. He knows the last mob would have worked just fine if it had been a little bigger and a little bit angrier."But if he can't tweet Facebook or Instagram anymore and seems to have no idea that there's a White House Press Room we wondered how he will get his new riot message out to his nutjob supporters."The President is also a very smart genius. He will get his message out in the other main place that his supporters gather online—the comments section of penis enlargement pills for sale on Amazon" explained Schitferbrains. "While the President along with Melania prefers a product called XXX Rhino Dong he is not beneath posting his riot instructions on the other more inferior penis enlargement pill comment sections too proving he is a very open-minded man."After some investigation Trump's biggest stumbling block could be that it is hard to get a word in edgewise in these penis pill comment sections."Yeah that's true" agrees Mr. Schitferbrains. "It's kinda like watching the comment scroll on a live webcast of a Beyoncé concert. It goes pretty damn fast! There's a lot of very angry Trump supporters out there whose penis pill purchase seemed to have little effect on their tiny wieners. And they all want their voices heard. It could be hard for the President to stand out. And he knows that. That's why he plans on using his super-duper secret weapon—ALL CAPS. Smart huh?!"But the pentagon has a solution for the impending 2nd impeachment riot. "We won't be caught with an insufficient number of cops on the Capitol Steps this time" says Four-Star General Dick Douche. "Nope cops won't do shit this time either since most of them have small penises too. What we plan to do is this—we will post a whole bunch of super hot liberal girls at the top of the Capitol steps all laughing hysterically at their tiny penises. That should do it" explains our Four Star Douche. "These Trumpers will be confused bewildered and rendered powerless because they ain't never been within 20 feet of a hot set of juggies. They'll have no idea what to do! We expect that after their 'guns' go off in their pockets they will just turn around and head for the nearest McDonalds for lunch and to clean themselves up a bit."So stay tuned America as the fight for democracy comes to a showdown between a clan of tiny-penised morons who have crawled back out of their mom's basement and some super hot chicks with big titties.Seems like the perfect end to the Trump regime to me!

This had the effect of making him lick his lips so hungry had he become.He said:"It was a lovely rich strong powerful smell which instantly made me ravenous for a pie!"This nasal assault started a chain reaction of 'culinary awakenings'.First he envisioned one of his mother's Shepherd Pies packed full of succulent minced lamb covered over with a thick blanket of crispy-topped mashed potato soaked in a meaty gravy and complemented with lashings of Heinz baked beans.Next he 'went Italian' imagining her Spaghetti Bolognese oozing sauce with green red and yellow peppers and thinly-sliced onions!As he wandered on in a dream-like daze sniffing the pungent air from the nearby food stalls he experienced other memories from his childhood such as roast chicken and chips and he realized that he hadn't eaten bacon for what seemed like eternity.Then he went back to work and scoffed the fried egg sandwich his wife had made for him that morning.

The last incident which has caused the word to surface once again is particularly moronic and sent shock waves through the world!Peach producers are completely opposite to those who incited the incident and produce wonderful sweet fruits that please people and do not cause people to riot rampage loot and act like hordes of lunatic imbeciles.Buckweezle gave the following comment to NBC here it is:"I'm peached-off about the word im-peach-ment because this time it is really 'meant' to give this massive asshole even more attention than he already has. Brother are we sick to death of this narcissist maniac!""Sir what name would you suggest?""Noose the Goose and leave my sweet peaches out of it!"As the world knows emotions are running high in the US at this sad moment in their history however this beacon of democracy will recover and if peach farmers can produce enough of their wonderful product it will certainly sweeten the pallets of most Americans but not those morons who always have 'bitter tastes' in their foul mouths!
Thursday 14 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152024/military-plan-to-fully-secure-the-capitol-forever,Military plan to fully secure the Capitol forever.,Engineers attached to the 47th Delaware Marines have come up with a brilliant plan to mechanise the Capitol dome in Washington and enable it to lift off like a rocket if any danger approaches the building. This would be a game changer for the members of Congress and give them an impregnability that few thought possible.However nobody has thought about how the building could safely return to the ground in the event of an insurrection the likes of last week's occurrence. Perhaps a parachute or an engine stabiliser might do the trick. Mrs Margo Swattle of Battle Creek PA disagreed. "Oh no that'd never work. Try a set of wings" the 79-year-old former stripper suggested.The plan is only at draft level and needs formal approval but people are saying that the Capitol needed something like this years ago.

Get me dirt on Joe Biden."The second impeachment was for inciting a domestic revolution while attempting to overturn an election. Clearly he lost the election but insisted he won it with the chant Stop The Steal.Since he was in office for four years and both impeachments took place in the last year and a half chances are Sticky Fingers wasn’t totally crime-free during the previous two-and-a-;half years.Maybe investigative reporters the FBI CIA or the sheriff haven’t discovered the buried crimes yet like what if he sold nuclear codes to pals Putin or Kim Jong Un? Could he be impeached post-White House or in a post-mortem sort of way? There could even be several more impeachable offenses hidden in the White House cellar yet to be uncovered.Is there a Statute of Limitations for impeachments of ex-presidents?So could Donald Trump be impeached three additional times after leaving the White House?Fox news said “Never!”PBS said “Possibly.”CNN said “Get outta here.”Netflix said “Yes! And a series of 29 episodes should follow.”Maybe Donald Trump might request some form of Statute of Impeachment Limitations for presidents.Read more by this author:

Civil Servants,Washington D.C. U.S.A. - Hissy-fitting Trump supporters who had their big impeachment riot plans thwarted by over 20000 National Guard troops at the Capitol on Wednesday decided to take their pissy little shit-fit out on any government employee they could find around D.C.We caught up with a group of three goat-horned losers waving dirty Trump flags to see what they were up to now that their numb nuts shit-for-brains leader was getting impeached for certain—again."I totally didn't pay to get on the bus!" said Deven Glickmeister who came to DC from Arizona to 'fuck some shit up.' "And I'm not paying all the way back to the airport neither! Stop The Steal! The Election Was Rigged!""And and we didn't pay to get into that big airplane building thingie. Hang Mike Pence!" said Clemons Labastard recounting his trip to the National Air and Space Museum which is free to anyone. "Donald Junior 2024!""I gots me a picture of me mooning the MLK statue thingie with my bare ass!" told Billy Jo Bimbopper of Mississippi who was hoping to beat a black person or two to death with a baseball bat with nails sticking out of it. But was likely only leaving with a picture of his ass. "Also I stuck a piece of gum on MLK's leg! Shoot Pelosi!! The Storm Is Here!!"""Yeah it was bit different scene at the Capitol this week so we decided to just walk around town fucking with any type a gov'ment thing we seen" explained our small clan's leader Robert H. Hickdipper III of Hope Falls Idaho.Mr. Hickdipper's big offense against the conspiracy-funded government so far on this mild and sunny Wednesday was to throw his empty Starbucks cup and bagel wrapper in the gutter "so the street sweeper will have to pick it up" boasted Hickdipper who knew it was a pretty lame protest in hindsight. "But just like Glick I ain't paying for the bus back to the airport neither! Trump 2024!! Let's Burn the Statue Of Liberty!"So just like everything else in the Trump presidency these three supporters' big trip to the nation's capital was turning into a steaming pile of crap too.Oh well.Farewell orange fart man. So long inbreed cockroaches that lust greedily for the smell of orange fart man's toxic expulsions. Please go and use your spiked baseball bats on each other for a bit while we try and fix all the crap your douchebag grandmaster fucked up.See you in four years.

She said that her husband hates the fact that he has been banned from Twitter Facebook YouTube and even the the X-Rated Horny Channel.She giggled as she said that for some weird-ass reason known only to himself the President had started sleeping in one of her sexy red MAGA teddies.Mrs. Trump noted that she is scared as hell that he will take the missile launching remote and fire off missiles towards Russia North Korea Seattle and Portland.She said that she is ready to dump the man who has become even more hated that Hitler Hirohito Ted Cruz and General George Custer combined.When Hannity asked if she planned to return to her native Slovenia when she left the White House she replied “Abso-fuck-ing-lutely!"

Little Trump pointed out that he knows some highly explicit things concerning his daddy and lots of sexy-ass women that no-one knows.Chipper Caruso with BBN talked with Barron’s nanny who told him that little Barron has been extremely depressed for the past four years.She said that he only has one friend from North Korea and he doesn’t speak a word of English.The nanny stated that the two boys just sit in Barron’s room and watch reruns of the old television shows “The Brady Bunch” “Gilligan’s Island” and “The Housewives of Intercourse Pennsylvania”.She also disclosed that Barron has not been allowed out of the White Folks House since October 31 when he went Trick or Treating with his big sister Ivanka and 13 Secret Service agents.When asked what he wants to be when he grows up little Barronito as the First Lady calls him replied that he wants to play basketball for his all-time favorite player LeBron James’ team the Los Angeles Lakers.

He heard a distinctive buzzing in his ear which meant their was a mosquito about and he reached for his mosquito zapper to resolve the matter.What happened next however could not have been predicted.Instead of snaring just one victim in the electrocuter there were several which he tipped out onto the floor sneering.After a short break for a cup of tea and a chocolate biscuit he proceeded to sweep the entire room with the zapper - under a bench and chairs at the side of a cupboard behind a computer table under a desk into dark recesses and in amongst some cardboard boxes containing old documents.Bodies piled up. Nobody called the police.The zapping continued until the red battery light on the zapper started to fade indicating a session of charging was appropriate.The death toll was enormous.If there were such a thing as a Mosquito Police Force Kenwood would have been in serious trouble but there isn't so he wasn't.

I was thinking about Game of Thrones” said Rudy.Asked what he meant by the reference to the hit fantasy show he further explained “I was trying to conjure up some fire-breathing dragons to go burn down the Congress.”Reporters interviewing the disgraced lawyer had no further questions.
Friday 15 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/152037/hunter-come-home,Hunter Come Home,BILLINGSGATE POST: In 1943 the movie Lassie Come Home was released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Starring Roddy McDowell and canine actor Pal it was a story about a Yorkshire boy and his rough collie Lassie. After her destitute family is forced to sell her Lassie escapes from her new owner and begins the long journey from Scotland to her Yorkshire home.This story about Hunter has many parallels to Lassie. Like Lassie Hunter has a nice pedigree. He went to Georgetown University and received his JD from Yale Law School. Because his family was destitute he was recruited to the board of Burisma Holdings one of the largest private natural gas producers in Ukraine. Because the company felt sorry for his plight they sluiced off around $85000 a month to poor Hunter so he could feed his family. He was also forced to pocket a paltry $3.5 XXXLarge from the wife of the former mayor of Moscow.On his wayward journey back home he hops on Air Force One with his old man and flies to China. There he sets up a joint venture with a Chinese company and discusses how the various partners in the deal could theoretically split up the equity.

Hopefully as soon as Joe Biden takes his oath of office the timing will be set and Trump will be able to utter his two most memorable words “You’re fired.”Yes Trump is petty and vindictive. Getting even is a top Trump priority. Making money is a fast second.Trump and his people are hoping that the networks will go for a split screen; Biden’s swearing-in on one half and then Trump’s “You’re fired” on the other.Giuliani has threatened to sue somebody if the networks don’t comply and go for the split screen.The first Apprentice-2021 program will deal with financing and finishing The Wall that Mexico never paid for and Trump never built.Trump is also hoping he’ll receive an Emmy this time around unless the Emmy Awards are rigged just like the 2020 election...Read more by this author:
Friday 15 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/152018/james-harden-trade-winners-and-losers,James Harden Trade - Winners and Losers,Everyone knows there are winners and losers in the James Harden trade. Why? Because trades and trade scenarios are binary of course! We analyze the two sides.Winners1. “Brooklyn Beards” references and admirers of alliteration.There hasn’t been a pairing of cities and their stars’ most defining feature since Sean Kemp and the Seattle Super Seed Spreaders.2. People who don’t care about impeachment.The President being impeached dominated the news cycle for approximately 3 minutes until the Harden trade and rightly so. Impeachment is to last January. Harden doesn’t get traded EVERY year.3. People who write winners and losers lists.Every sports site and news organization had the boilerplate ready for James Harden and that work finally paid off. Just insert the date and circumstances updated with the latest news. The same sentiment goes for those who have already written their Ed Asner tributes……”...most recently appearing as the surly step-father in Cobra Kai.”Losers1. Brooklyn fans who like good young players. See ya later 2021-2027 first round draft picks!2.. Teachers who also write sports blogs. Imagine that you’ve just finished another long day in the virtual classroom and are knee-deep in grading another uninspired paper on the relationship of the downfall of the Weimar Republic and the popularity of Tik Tok when the trade news breaks. Now you have to grade no less than 4 teams and somehow fight your bias that Cleveland will never get above a C minus on anything.3. The NHL. It’s opening night and nobody cares...again.
Friday 15 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/152036/don-lemon-calls-out-nazis-and-klansmen,Don Lemon Calls Out Nazis and Klansmen,Don Lemon a CNN anchor unironically named after a bitter fruit doubled down on his recent accusations against 70 million or so Americans who voted for Donald Trump claiming that they are all Nazis and Klansmen.Given a chance to walk back this seemingly hyperbolic rhetoric Lemon instead claimed that he “believed what he said” raising a philosophical question of great interest to almost no one. That is whether the old expression “saying is believing” can be true in any meaningful sense or if it is possible that Mr. Lemon generously acknowledged an intellectual lightweight by his supporters and a fool by the rest believed that there were 70 million Nazis loose in the country before he said it. If it is true that one can come to believe something by the simple act of speaking it aloud speech thereby acquires a magical dimension leading to a number of intriguing possibilities. For example Donald Trump might use such power to claim that he actually won the recent election and not by a little.While rational thinkers naturally reject such magical ideas recent evidence is mounting against the rationalists. Despite all the criticisms and ridicule aimed at Mr. Lemon – one caustic critic pointing out that his name implied something awry in his manufacture – a surprising development now lends support to Lemon’s charges against half his countrymen and to his philosophy of the active power of the Word to bring reality into existence. Almost as soon as the controversy bloomed sales of swastikas hooded sheets with pre-fitted eye-holes and collection of Nazi and Klan memorabilia exploded on the internet. Amazon as happy to sell its customers an “authentic plastic replica German WWII Luger with Adolf Hitler signature” as a hula hoop reports that it cannot keep up with demand for copies of Mein Kampf and facsimiles of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.As with the fake Russian “collusion” accusations against Trump stemming from the 2016 election and the equally fake accusations of corruption and influence peddling against the Biden “crime family” it is becoming increasingly clear in the age of social media that saying IS believing and that words have the magical power to make false things real. On Twitter Pinocchio can become a real boy.One wonders if Don Lemon a miked-up man of no special talent or distinction will one day regret carelessly conjuring into existence a world brimming with Nazis and Klansmen?

Screamed Ole as United smashed Liverpool!To describe a baboon's or other primate-rear-ends often observed at the zoo: "Daddy look that Monkey over there it has a butt that looks like a PEACH it's red too and what's that red pointed thing at the front is it a red-hot-chili-pepper?"Romeo's terminology: "Darling your cheeks are like PEACHES rosy red and your bum too cannot wait until we hit the covers so I can get my teeth into it!"Im-PEACH-ment: A word not quite 'meant' to be so sweet but when they imPEACH a fucking US presidential moron twice the taste released can be extremely sweet!Spoofers PEACHES: Utilised by the sheer eccentric cryptical genius of a mad spoofer who shall remain nameless to 'rinse' the imbecile who got booted out of the White House! And because it was so genial another unnamed spoofer borrowed the idea and caused a PEACH of a conflict!A similar PEACH of a conflict is also acted out annually in a quaint village in Italy called Ivrea where opponents bombard each other with ORANGES not PEACHES because PEACHES have huge pips and when bung could cause concussion a blind eye or brain damage an illness quite common on this site especially in the forum department!However this Italian epic fruity battle is a real PEACH of a news story so the writer of this PEACH of a spoof must first beg the permission of his beloved editor before he is imPEACHed spoof style!This PEACH of a spoof is quite 'PIPPING!

He looked down and saw the House Speaker desperately trying to fold her horrendous-looking vagina back into her pants with her left hand. She was simultaneously moving her computer mouse with her right hand apparently in an effort to close whatever was open on her screen” said a friend of Marvin again according to unverified rumors circulating online.“The Capitol Building is not Nancy's sexual playground!” said one angered party member. “She can’t even keep her minge out of her hands from 9 to 5.”Marvin also claims that after discovering Nancy tooting her flange he got a threatening call from a protected number in which someone 'who sounded like a cackling evil witch' posing as a Federal Agent told him to keep quiet about what he had witnessed or “something very bad will happen to you.”According to Marvin's lawyer whom he has retained to file a lawsuit (according to unverified rumors circulating online): "A hostile and discriminatory environment is fostered at The Capitol an organization run mainly by sexually suppressed older women because of its leaders' willingness to look the other way and put sexual satisfaction before people. No man should ever be subjected to the outrageous conduct Mr. Shawshank endured and we look forward to receiving damages compensation and an unequivocal apology for the horrific sight he witnessed - a sight that will live with this man forever. A scene that is the thing of nightmares. For any man."Efforts to reach Pelosi were unsuccessful.

Trump.ASM writer Fitzwater Ribicoff announced that the President received 47902 votes and the other 7 nominees received a combined total of 43 votes.Ribicoff stated that when POTUS learned of his latest honor he pouted like a 2-year-old spoiled brat.He pushed Kayleigh McEnany to the floor and picked up an ashtray and threw it against the wall barely missing Maria Bartiromo his favorite reporter and rumored side piece.An unnamed source overheard Trump whine that he hates being the biggest asshole in the entire United States including Puerto Rico.One of the President’s Secret Service agents was overheard muttering under his breath "Well you’ve certainly earned that award you fucked-up turdhead."Meanwhile Fox News host Maria Bartiromo has in no uncertain terms denied the rumors that she is pregnant with Trump's baby.

Friday 15 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152032/republicans-demand-second-impeachment-of-bill-clinton,Republicans Demand Second Impeachment of Bill Clinton,The Capitol Washington D. C. Woof Blister reporting for The Spoof.House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy today issued a call for the House to proceed with a second impeachment of former President Bill Clinton. In response Speaker Nancy Pelosi threatened a second impeachment of Andrew Johnson who like Clinton was acquitted in the first effort to remove him from office.McCarthy argued that Clinton had disgraced his office by first lying to the Congress and to the American people about his role in the Lewinsky affair. "The man should never be allowed to hold public office again yet the failure of the Senate to convict him leaves open the possibility that Clinton will take a federal position in President-elect Joe Biden's administration."The chances of such a second Clinton impeachment process happening is nil said Pelosi. On the other hand the Democrats House majority could easily tarnish Andrew Johnson's legacy by voting to impeach a second time. Johnson had betrayed his Democratic party colleagues by accepting the vice presidency under Republican Abraham Lincoln. He was acquitted by a single vote."We'll get him this time" Pelosi said

To take over a weaker country and become its king?"Because he wrote in red sharpie at the bottom of the map in the ocean part 'Red Countrys I Could Be King Of.'Fair enough."But he also colored in New Zealand and Canada" explained our source who has been using a fake name for over a year now. Then he found out about Maori people and politeness and backed off. He can't stand people saying 'sorry'. It drives him crazy. Even he knew he'd go mad in Canada. Plus 'too much clothing on the 'chicks' he was often heard saying after a visit there."We're pretty sure he's in cahoots with Bashar al-Assad to slowly take the reins in Syria. It's hot there; less clothing. Use some of that fortune he just scammed from his drooling stooges since the election to buy in. He likes the fury he sees in the masses there. He thinks he could sculpt them into a beautiful Trumpian Society. And he knows Bashar has a weakness for snorting meth off of teenage prostitutes like he does. They text some pretty gross GIFs back and forth."Perfect we reckoned. Orange turd man will fit in very well in Syria. After all the capitol is called 'Dumbass-cus!'

P.G. Wodehouse is long gone; however his comical ghost still haunts the minds of those who loved his typical 'stiff upper lip' aristocratic stories.The ghost of P.G. has entered Jaggedone's lughole and requested him to reignite his passion for Jeeves and Bertie Woodhouse in the modern era. P.G. has given Jaggedone some 'Tips' (Wow it is teatime!) about how to integrate this famous pair into the modern world and here they are:"Jeeves Old Bean have you read that drat Daily Express rat-pack I hear old Rees-Mogg is one of us!""No Sire but he's certainly a vital member of a Rat-Pack currently residing in the House."Jeeves that's rather spiffing pop down to London and invite him to high tea in our glorious mansion.""Yes Sire can I borrow the Rolls?""Which one?""Sire the 1920 Silver Shadow will do better than these modern Indian made Jaguars that old BOJO bombs around in that'll impress them when I turn up!""But Jeeves Old Bean who is BOJO?

Hot liquid" Ralf Newsome told Local News on Monday. "I was soaked and it was coming off my eyelashes and into my eyes” he added. “Paramedics who came to treat me said there was so much of it on me that it looked like Pelosi was saving it up for a month.”The harrowing incident reportedly happened just off Walls and 5th where the decorated veteran had been panhandling for change with a group of fellow homeless vets. After rattling his coin-laden polystyrene coffee cup in the direction of a 'well dressed but mean-looking old lady' he was attacked by who Newsome believes was none other than Nancy Pelosi. Pelosi has strenuously denied the allegation.“It was all inside my shopping cart because there was so much. She just kept pouring it and splattering it all over me” he said.The victim was taken to a hospital and checked for infectious diseases the report said. There will be further testing.Newsome said he wants to see his attacker get treatment for the psychological condition that caused her to attack him.The victim said he suffers PTSD from the grotesque encounter and believes some form of counseling ought to be made available for people like himself who are left traumatized by such crimes.“It was awful” said Newsome tearfully recalling the incident. "It changed my life. It was worse than all the horrors I faced in Iraq!”Local News confirmed there was a police report and that security cameras from downtown DC recorded the incident and immediate aftermath. Newsome asked DC police to view that footage and they reportedly decided against letting him see it.He said he has “empathy” for his sick attacker whose face he’ll never forget. It concerns Newsome that the woman is still on the streets presumably untreated.“What’s the next thing she’s going to do somebody?” he asked.A spokesman for Pelosi released a brief statement in which she denied any involvement in the incident; however CCTV footage circulating on the internet has many convinced that it was indeed Pelosi who is well known for defecating into buckets and makes no secret of her hate for hobos bums and veterans who poured runny shit over the head of an American hero.

He thanked his assistant coach Gloria Vagabaldi for giving him CPR all four times.The rumor that Coach de la Cerveza and Assistant Coach Vagabaldi are now dating has not be verified as of press time.In a related story according to the iNews Agency Cucamonga A&M linebacker Chester Coolidge 29 was arrested after the game for shooting up the Grambling team bus. Luckily the Grambling players were still in the locker room showering at the time of the shooting.

Saturday 16 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/152045/use-of-lethal-force-its-nearly-always-justified,Use of Lethal Force: It's Nearly Always "Justified",Protests over excessive use of lethal force by cops doesn't usually result in an admission that the officer was in the wrong. Instead public information officers find a logical explanation for a deadly shooting that arouses the public. Here is what might occur at a squad meeting following such an incident:An uneasy feeling permeated the squad room as half a dozen or so officers waited for Chief Backoff’s appearance. They knew the Chief’s reprimand would be harsh biting and very personal. After all the shooting of a nude woman had never occurred here before. And two of the three cops who pulled the triggers were in the room.Abruptly the squad room door banged open and Chief Backoff barreled in. The six shiny stars on his collar reflected light from the overhead bulb which dangled from a wire in the center of the room. The department’s Public Information officer entered as well.“Where’s Johnson?” barked Backoff mentally taking a roll call. Johnson was the third shooter.“On a donut run. We told him to bring back the gooey ones you like.”Backoff took his place behind a podium the PI beside him.“Gentlemen we have a public relations nightmare. Who shot an unarmed nude young pregnant woman?”Patrolmen Higgins and Smith meekly admitted their role in the shooting. Backoff asked Higgins to explain how two husky patrolmen had to shoot a woman.“We had a 9-1-1 call. Domestic violence at a party. Some uninvited woman crashed the affair nude and the host couldn’t get her to leave. So he called 9-1-1. Chief I hope they aren’t making a racial issue out of this. Two of us are white and the other shooter is black. This was an affirmative action shoot.”Smith took up the explanation. “When we got there she was on the lawn. We asked her to leave. She wouldn’t and when she came toward us… we shot.”“Twelve times?” The Chief’s voice expressed disbelief. “And that’s just the shells that hit her. The home owner is still tallying up the damage caused by all the ones that missed her and hit his house.”“How am I going to sell this to the public?” inquired the PI officer.Robinson the rookie of the department had an idea. “Say she reached for her waistband. That’s one the public always buys.”Groans from the assemblage. Higgins looked sharply at Robinson shaking his head. “The woman was nude.”“Wait” said Hopkins. “Don’t dismiss that so easily. Robinson’s right. We’ve used that one in six other fatalities this year and no one ever complains. Maybe she was wearing a thong. She coulda had a derringer hidden in it. If she wasn’t Lothario could say he found a thong near the body. He’s got a collection of them. He was the investigating officer. Didn’t you find a thong that might have been shot off her by a wayward slug?”Lothario ignoring the question offered his own solution. “The waistband excuse won’t work. How about Higgins and Smith feared for their lives? We’ve used that one so often that only some pointy-headed professor still complains about it when we roll out that excuse er… explanation.”“Good Lord gentlemen” roared the Chief. “You didn’t shoot an Amazon. ‘Feared for your lives?’ The woman was 5′ 2″ and not an ounce over 110 pounds. And she was pregnant.”Lothario’s face brightened. “That’s it Chief. We fired to protect the unborn infant. An act of humanity.”The PI officer dismissed the suggestion. “She was only one month pregnant. How would you know she was with child?”All eyes turned toward Lothario whose reputation for maneuvering female traffic violators was well known. Sgt. Perez nodding wondered aloud:“Perhaps we ought to check the traffic warnings as opposed to the tickets that Lothario has issued. Maybe the lady’s name will turn up on one. Speeding running a light failure to pull over… and Lothario just gives her a gentle warning? How long ago might that have been Lothario?”“I haven’t been on traffic duty for two months. Don’t look there.”“Forget it” roared the Chief. “Saving the fetus? Six of your twelve hits were in her abdomen. Let’s move on. Any other suggestions?”Smith responded: “Chief she was armed.”An air of relief seemed to come over the meeting. This was the answer the Chief had been seeking.“This is the first time I’ve heard that she was armed. Did we find a gun?”“It wasn’t a gun Chief. She had a broken wine glass in her hand. It looked awful sharp.”“We did find a broken glass at the scene. In fact the place was littered with broken glasses” the PI offered in support.A skeptical Chief went on: “That might not fly. Was there any other reason to shoot this woman?”Higgins brightened up. “Yeah she acted like she was high on drugs. Yeah that might explain why we feared for our lives.”“Toxicology reports will probably come in negative. Then where are we?” asked the Chief.“Well” said Smith searching for a justification “She sure seemed mentally unbalanced. We shoot that kind all the time. Or maybe she wanted to commit suicide. We shot two of those in one week last year.”“What makes you think she was out of her mind?” asked Backoff.“What 20-year-old in her right mind would come to a party buck naked?” Smith replied.“Good Lord!” Even Higgins the other shooter couldn’t swallow that one. “Everyone else at the party was buck naked! We were the only ones with clothes on. Well we had been the only ones until we decided we ought to strip too so as not to call so much attention to ourselves.”“You mean you were out of uniform when you shot her? That’s a violation of our code of conduct. When we’re through here I want to see both of you in my office.”The PI shook his head. “Nudity can’t be our cover in this situation.” There were smothered giggles at that one.“I got it Chief” shouted Jones smugly convinced he had the answer. “She was reaching for Johnson’s gun so we had to shoot her. We often rely on that one.”The PI didn’t hesitate. “She was ten feet from them when they shot. How long was her arm? We’ve got to show that this use of lethal force was within department policy.”“ALL OUR KILLINGS ARE WITHIN DEPARTMENT POLICY.” That response came from a whole chorus of officers.“Not every one” responded Watkins the longest-serving member of the force. “Before you guys came aboard we fired Kharkov after he killed a blind man carrying a white cane. Kharkov thought it was a white rifle since the guy was holding it by the barrel. When the guy turned at Kharkov’s demand to halt the ‘muzzle’ was pointed right at Kharkov so he fired the fatal shot. We would have ruled that within department policy but the public outrage was so great the DA insisted we fire him. We did he sued got his job back plus a couple of million for damages. He got more than the victim’s family. With all that money he didn’t need the job retired on a good pension and bought a winery in Napa. Sends us a Christmas card and a bottle each year.”“So” asked the Chief “What’s left? How are we going to explain what the press is now calling a murder by cop?”The room was silent for a moment. Then the door banged open with a crash and every officer in the room reached for his service weapon. Johnson mustache flecked with bits of chocolate and a white cream drop the huge box of donuts he was carrying as he rushed through the door and jumped behind the podium where the Chief stood. Donuts flew everywhere rolled along the floor leaving trails of jelly and coconut.No one fired except Johnson who in self defense had pulled out his pepper spray – he wasn’t allowed a taser – by mistake and accidentally squirted the Chief barely hitting him. The room was in an uproar over the loss of the donuts.“Silence!” shouted the Chief once again in command. He wiped away the spray residue little of which hit him since Johnson was such a poor marksman his scores on the range always at the bottom of the list. “That’s it. That’s how we’ll explain it.”“How’s that?” asked the PI perplexed turning toward the Chief.“The pepper spray. Johnson tried to spray the lady but he missed – we won’t mention that part – and she kept coming with that broken glass in her hand. You had no choice but to shoot. Now wipe off those donuts pour the coffee and let’s get on with the day. And remember be careful out there.”
Saturday 16 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152044/land-mine-appears-in-washington,Land mine appears in Washington,Police in Washington have discovered a land mine in the Pool of Remembrance near the Washington Monument. It is believed to have been left there by supporters of the Where Do I Find A Land Mine When I Need One? Association.This group have operated under the radar for a couple of years and were first brought to the public consciousness when they put a land mine in the Empire State Building elevator in New York. Their end game is somewhat confusing as neither mine was fully primed to explode.So the idea seems to be that the group are providing a public service rather than posing a terrorist threat to American citizens. Can't be half as bad as an unstable president trashing his own government.
Saturday 16 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/science-technology/151564/data-usage-warning-received,'Data Usage Warning' Received,There was consternation earlier today when quite without warning and totally unexpectedly a man who was using his phone to browse the internet received a notification that amounted to a:'Data Usage Warning'Recovering from the initial shock browser Moys Kenwood 57 took stock of the situation and tried to think which key he could possibly have pressed to have prompted the phone to send him this kind of message.He said:"It must be wrong. I never use data."What Kenwood hadn't realized however was that by merely accessing the internet he was already 'using data' data that was not his and that the usage of which he was now being warned.As well as the warning about his usage of the data there was also a further instruction to:"Tap to view usage and settings"but this went straight over his head without bothering to enter into his consciousness.It's not the first time that Kenwood has received a Data Usage Warning. He said:"It's not the first time I've received a Data Usage Warning. I usually just ignore them and they tend to go away."Experts say ignoring them is probably the best course of action although they're not absolutely sure.

Soon his head felt like it was splitting apart and nobody having any paracetamols he began to wonder if he wasn't living his final hours. He decided to go for a piss.The toilet facilities were on the floor below in the building's basement. It was very quiet lonely and creepy. As he pushed the door open he sensed he was alone which was perfect for a familiar sensation told him he had a massive fart brewing that would no doubt frighten other people should they hear it.As he stood at the urinal he felt the fart working its way towards his bumhole and bending his knees exerted as much 'downward pressure' as he could muster.It escaped with a rushing of air just as two of Kenwood's colleagues walked through the door. They were uninjured but it's possible they still have troubled dreams because of it.Kenwood meanwhile felt a huge release of pressure being released from the back of his head rather like a kettle boiling or a balloon suddenly being deflated.He told friends back in the office. One commented wryly:"It's typical of you - your brain's connected to your arse!"Several people laughed.

Periwinkle stated that for years the man who is now regarded as the worst president in the history of presidents has tremendously exaggerated his net worth.Don the Con has claimed he is worth $9.2 billion but the truth of the matter is he is only worth $3.1 million.Now comes word that he is so desperate for money that he is selling presidential pardons for $1 million each. So far he has netted $173 million.GOPicky Magazine reports that he is selling presidential pardons to members of his insurrectionist army of right-wing anarchists who have been charged with invading the USA on his orders.The President knows that most of his group of invaders really have no money to speak of so he has offered to sell them full pardons at a much lower reduced price of $25000 each.Trump’s newest ass-kisser Michael Lindell aka The My Pillow Guy has offered to purchase presidential pardons for 200 of the scum-sucking treasonous traitors.

PM orders the nation to cover itself in leafage,UK seaport officials were stunned this week to see their harbours and wharfs replete with leaf-bearing vessels from all four corners of the earth.The British government has been steadily buying up the world's stocks of swept leaves all part of a covert scheme to force hibernation on the country's population and thereby stem this dreadful Covid 19 virus."Yes" confirmed Johnson "we will be ordering all citizens not just to stay at home but to enter into compulsory hibernation until March. Each household will receive a measured volume of vegetation and greenery to cover its members for the next few weeks and prevent this thing from spreading. Tenements and sky-scrapers will be sprinkled with Canadian maple leaves until no longer visible. I think it should all look rather pretty don't you?"Specific areas such as Bradford and Birmingham are to be coated in 'appropriate' toppings leafage from the mango tree and white mangrove for our Pakistani friends and banyan and arjuna leaves for our Indian brothers and sisters."I know" said Johnson "it's brilliant right?! And we couldn't have done it if we'd had to ask Brussels. Admit it!!"Forced hibernation is however not for all. "Alas no" said the PM. "We at Downing Street as well as my team and colleagues and friends will be self-isolating in agony on a cruise liner currently unused. We all have a cross to bear in this combat. And I can't just stand around. Our ship is waiting and Admiral Cummings is becoming impatient. So ahoy! And enjoy the foliage. I'll be back to sweep it all up in March!"With that he was gone the nation succumbed to foliation hidden under a resplendent sea of leaves asleep in time and though trapped drifting on in blissful oblivion while their leader sailed away towards the sun.
Sunday 17 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/152058/liverpool-v-manchester-always-a-historical-battle,Liverpool v Manchester always a historical battle!,(NOT EDITED) Apart from the minor fact that there are two huge footy clubs in the wonderful county of Lancashire the rivalry between Liverpool and Manchester goes much darker and deeper!Both teams wear red but it is a fact that Liverpool's 'RED' is much darker than Manchester's and resembles blood. Manchester's 'RED' is slightly lighter and resembles a proud Red Rose.Manchester thrived on cotton mills and the textile industry Liverpool thrived on those who picked the cotton being a major hub for dirty-doings in a certain trade which they love to sweep under their carpets.Manchester built canals heading eastwards to Yorkshire where cotton was also turned into textiles. Hence assisting poor Yorkshire inhabitants to stop shagging their sheep (in metaphorical terminology). Liverpool however concentrated on creating waterways heading west. A much more liable business in 'darker' times.Manchester hosts a Light-Blue version of the Red invincible version. The Light Blues tend to look towards the Middle East to oil their chains. Liverpool have a Dark-Blue-Version they tend to get stuck like a lump of 'toffee' behind the Red version whose chains are not oiled by Sheikhs. Therefore the Red version is driven by a crazed German Nutter not a panzer.Today's spectacle sadly behind closed doors will be overshadowed by an awful rendition of a Liverpool song enough to send Manchurians mad and an increase in the usage of 'Pacemakers' in Manchester.Lancastrians say the War of the Roses is the catalyst of sometimes violent rivalry between Leeds and United the real United. However Scousers always look to Manchester as their main rivals because Liverpool will always play second fiddle to their 'Big Brother' down the Manchester Ship Canal historically speaking.The canal is called Manchester Ship Canal because Liverpool is quite ashamed of their 'waterways' towards America and the cargo they once transported! Manchester tended to do business in 'whiter-than-white' cotton products. However both business types have now disappeared. One towards Bangladesh and other poor Asian nations. The other has disappeared forever thank the heavens and Liverpool can always be proud of their Beatles a much more pleasant export article!

The hosts will be missing joint top scorer Eddie Muppet who has netted three times this season all from the penalty spot. He has an appointment at the dentist.And defender Timmy 'Babyface' Tompkins is also unavailable as it's his birthday and his mum has organised a party for him and all of his friends. He'll be 23.Bolton also have problems. The truth is they're just not very good anymore.The Trotters spent several years in the Premier League before poor financial handling left them squarely in the shit and almost bundled them out of existence until their future was secured by a mystery donor.Well it's a mystery to me anyway.Tranmere currently occupy 15th place in the League Two table with Wanderers a single point behind them in 17th and with a lot at stake in this highly-charged derby it's to be hoped that it will turn out to be a wonderful spectacle for fans or at least that the match might be completed without one or other of the teams going bankrupt.

They easily beat a Los Angeles Rams team 32-18 that said it was just too damn cold to be playing outside.The U.S. weather service said that the temperature at kick-off was minus 7 degrees with a wind chill factor of minus 21.Green Bay quarterback and State Farm Insurance rep Aaron Rodgers played his best game of the season as he tossed touchdown passes of 87 91 and 101 yards.After the game he was asked how he felt. He admitted that he felt both happy and sad.He said he was sad because he really has missed the hell out of his ex-girlfriend former NASCAR driver and the best kisser in Wisconsin Danica Patrick.Aaron dedicated the victory to Danica who he said makes the best marijuana-flavored guacamole dip that he has ever tasted.Many of the Packers fans spent half-time making snowmen snowwomen and snowkids. One man actually made a snow Donald Trump but two security guards made him destroy it.A Rams special teams player said he bought a hot dog right before the start of the game but had to throw it away because it was frozen solid.Play actually had to be stopped at the start of the fourth quarter when two of the game balls broke in half.And hundreds of male fans said that they could not flush the urinals in the bathrooms since they were frozen solid with yellow ice.Meanwhile the Rams players and coaches said they’d be so damn glad to get back to L.A. and the warm 85-degree summertime weather.

Lost real real bad. It happens a lot around D.C.But 'Scoots' didn't even want to be anywhere near D.C. He had been driving from his sister's husband's lobster boat business in Maine where his brother-in-law had offered him work. 'Well that didn't pan out too well' tells Scoots 'and I was heading back to Mississippi to lick my wounds."Literally Scoots was licking a nasty gash on his arm. We asked if he'd stop but he wouldn't taking the little saying to new heights.'Well happens I had all kinds of ammo in my truck box even some crazy ass shit I didn't even know'd was in there.' ''What's a snake bomb boy?'' Scoots recounted the arresting officer asking at the Capitol check point.Scoots was trying to scoot around the outside of D.C. but got a little sideway at a construction zone and somehow ended up only 2 blocks from the Capitol. "Tell ya the truth I don't give a shoot about politics. I was out on that crazy ass lobster boat and didn't vote nohow. Didn't care neither. I always thunk politics was a bunch of snooky-doodies anyhow. I just thought the big dome buildin' would have a bathroom i could use or a bush or sumpin."But Scoots won't be making it back to Bumblefudge anytime soon. "We have to make sure he's not a front line hardcore Q-freakjob infantry unit under deep cover" confirmed the arresting Capitol officer. "My suspicion is that its an affirmative."In the meantime Scoots was meeting all kinds of crazy new friends in jail who wanted to be his friend and the things they said about Trump made a lot of sense to Scoots "No wonder I's always so broke so much a the time? We gotta stop this steal thing! Just like that guy in the horns over there says. I just hope the cops don't find my hardcore barnyard porn under the seat of my 250. Shoot Pelosi! I don't know how my new friends would feel about sheep porn. But the guy in the horns might be into it? Trump Won! Will you ask him for me. But don't make it obvious..."Good Luck Scooots!Trump 2024!

Unfortunately Putin can’t make it. Kim Jong-un is busy and the Queen of England is occupied with her horses. So he’ll have to settle for the few stragglers remaining at the White House to wave him off on Marine One.At Andrews Air Force Base where Air Force One is parked Trump hoped for the Marine Corp band to celebrate his final departure. However the band will be at Joseph R. Biden's inaugural ceremony but the airbase will play a record instead supplied by Joseph R. Biden.Trump will leave Washington D.C. as president but mid-way to Florida he’ll become the former president. Air Force One will then land at the nearest airstrip and Trump with luggage and relatives will be transferred onto a commercial flight or any plane headed for Florida with available seating.Air Force One will then immediately make a U-turn back to D.C. to await flight orders if any from President Joseph R. Biden.At the airstrip Trump’s luggage and boxes will be checked for any smuggled items taken from the White House. White House labeled soaps and bathrobes are considered okay but the Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington and famed bust sculpture of Abraham Lincoln are no-nos.The White House silver has already been counted and safely stored as were all chandeliers candelabras china rugs and drapery.A cavity search will not be required and the golden toilet belonging to Trump has already been removed and flushed back to Florida.However it is believed that Donald Trump will be back in Washington D.C. in 4 to 6 months.Read more by this author:

Now however because of the club's desperate plight 'Waggy' has dusted himself down and scraped the mud from his boots to 'give it another go'.Moys Kenwood 57 who clearly remembers Wagstaff tormenting defences during the early 1970s said:"Waggy was always a threat to opposition defences and it didn't matter who City were playing. Just ask Gordon Banks if you don't believe me!"Of course the Stoke City and England legend can't be asked because he died in 2020 but you know what Kenwood means.Waggy went into coaching after his playing days were over and then into pub management before finally retiring. Now however Tigers fans can look forward to defences being run ragged once more as the veteran limbers up in readiness by taking a walk around his back garden.Said Kenwood:"I can't wait to see him perform again. Even with a walking stick or in a wheelchair he'd put the current 'strikers' in the shade!"

Ninety-eight years ago heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey and Argentine challenger Luis Angel Firpo produced a boxing classic that will live in infamy as “The fight of all the ages.”Not since the Roman Empire when Commodus was thrown to the lions in the Colosseum has there been such a reversal in outcomes. After having one arm and a leg torn off by the ravaging lions Commodus came back to slay the beasts in overtime.Could History repeat itself?It certainly could. It happened at New York’s Polo Grounds in front of 85000 crazed fans inside the stadium. It figured to be an entertaining fight. Two free-swinging heavyweights both in their prime who wanted to end the fight early.But no one was prepared for what happened.The Manassa Mauler as Jack Dempsey was known had been champion since 1919. Firpo was a crude powerfully built slugger known as “the Wild Bull of the Pampas.”The fight lasted 3 minutes 57 seconds but there were nine knockdowns.Dempsey had knocked Firpo down three times in a wild first round when he had Dempsey against the ropes. Firpo hit Dempsey with a thunderous right hand to the chin. Dempsey’s head snapped back and he sailed over the ropes landing on his back on the press table.Unable to regain his feet Dempsey flailed and thrashed about on the press table while the referee began a count.With the friendly reporters lending a hand Dempsey climbed back into the ring where he knocked Firpo down again before the bell ended the round. In the second round Dempsey dropped Firpo for good with a right hand less than a minute into the second round.Might History repeat itself once again?After being unceremoniously tossed out of the White House by Nancy Poozleosi and her blood-thirsty minions will the Mar-a-Lago Mauler climb back into the ring and throw the bums out in 2024?Dr. Slim: “From Commodus to Dempsey to Trump. The torch will pass.”Dirty: “Yo Dr. Dude. How many sequels did Rocky and Rambo have?”

And she meant it.It seems that Donald Trump had made plans to skip the inauguration and instead hop on a plane (not Air Force One) and take refuge flying away to his golf course in Scotland.Not so fast said the First Minister. Trump is no longer president and since the United Kingdom is experiencing a new and more contagious strain of COVID-19 the country is now in lockdown.But if he were still president would he be allowed to land in Scotland?That's up in the air.So Sturgeon announced that NO one was coming in or going out including Donald Trump soon to be the former president.“The world can be a dark place at times just now — but today we are seeing a wee break in the clouds” she said.It is speculated that the wee break in the clouds is someone at last saying NO to Donald Trump diplomatically framing a golf holiday as nonessential travel.Neither Donald Trump nor his team has released a statement.Apparently Trump thought he could grab Scotland by the pussy fly over to his golf course move in and play golf.No no no!Read more by this author:

I get them all wrong and it makes me sad."Mr. Barnacle confirmed that he gives his students a spelling challenge every Friday and most of them treat it as a bit of fun. He said:"Most students enjoy it. Third place gets a star on the star chart second gets two stars and the winner gets three. There are some complex rules if any of the top three places are tied but the majority think it's a game. Tessie is a bit of a grouch however. We call her 'Tessie Tension'."Tessie's friend Alison said she is rather a worrier:"She's got a lot on her plate.

Monday 18 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/science-technology/152067/sushi-shaped-space-ship-lands-on-malibu-beach,Sushi-Shaped Space Ship Lands on Malibu Beach,MALIBU BEACH California – (Satire News) – Several residents of Malibu Beach called up the Malibu Beach sheriff’s department and reported a UFO in the left coast sky.A reporter with Hollywood Hors D'oeuvres said she interviewed a couple Toby and Chiffon Cornflower who said that they were walking their pet kangaroo on the beach when they suddenly heard a noise that sounded like Rudy Giuliani belching.At first they thought it may have been a mini-tsunami that had been reported in the area earlier in the day.But after ascertaining that the ocean water looked normal they looked up and to their amazement saw a strange sushi-shaped spaceship-looking object.When their pet kangaroo “Pockets” started quacking uncontrollably they knew that something was up because as everyone knows kangaroos do not quack.'Roos as Keith Urban and Nicole Kidman call them do make a kind of barking sound much like a cross between a Doberman Pinscher and a Pomeranian but they certainly don't quack.The Cornflowers wondered if their imagination may have been related to the 8 marijuana joints each had smoked a few hours earlier.They even thought that maybe it could have been some bad Lobster Newberg they had consumed the night before at Demi Lovato's beach house.As they were trying to figure it out the UFO suddenly landed on the beach 45 yards from them.They ran over to get a closer look just as a sheriff’s deputy had arrived on the scene. The officer took his shotgun and emptied both barrels into the metallic blue UFO object.The space vehicle suddenly fired up it retro-rockets and immediately took off in the direction of Catalina Island before disappearing into the California sunset.Meanwhile the Cornflowers were both taken into custody and given a drug test.They were released 45 minutes later after posting a $700 bond.
Monday 18 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/sport/152065/sons-of-confederates-demand-baseball-yankees-change-their-name,"Sons of Confederates" Demand Baseball "Yankees" Change Their Name,Richmond VA. An SOS from Wood Blister in an exclusive to Spoof On Sports.In response to efforts by liberal Northerners to remove Confederate statues names of Confederates from military bases and the banning of the song "Dixie" at athletic events the "Sons of the Confederacy" meeting in this one-time capital of The Confederate States of America have demanded that the New York America League baseball team drop its nickname "Yankees"."We find it offensive that for decades the predominant team in baseball has carried that demeaning name so closely associated with our opposition in the War Between the States. When that team takes a road trip into Dixie it is a reminder of General Sherman's inhumane march through Georgia over a century-and-a-half ago. Those wealthy Northern owners of that team haven't had the decency to realize the hurt that returns each time a "Yankee" team enters the South. Can you imagine the Northern outrage if a Southern team carried the nickname of Stonewall or Confederates?"If the name "Redskins" is demeaning why isn't "Yankees?"When asked about the complaint the press agent for the New York team simply smiled and said: "Our teams usually mop up on those southern squads. Maybe we should change the name to Sherman's Marauders."

Monday 18 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/entertainment-gossip/152060/jackie-chans-rush-hour-4-stalled,Jackie Chan's Rush Hour 4 Stalled,While promoting their newest film Rush Hour 4 in New York City yesterday Jackie Chan apparently became enraged at Chris Tucker’s self-promotion as the “star” of the franchise and strangled him to death in front of hundreds of shocked on-lookers.The former Mr. Nice Guy allegedly mocked Tucker with “Can you understand the words NOT coming out of your mouth?” Chan refused to let go of Tucker’s throat deftly fending off people rushing the stage with skilled kicks and even using Tucker’s hard head as an impromptu weapon.After dropping the apparently lifeless body to the ground Chan did a back flip scaled a 15-foot wall swung from a rope to a third story balcony shimmied across a cable and dropped onto the roof of a passing semi-truck making good his escape. Entertainment reporters thinking the entire incident was a scene from the up-coming movie applauded wildly.Tucker meanwhile was rushed to a nearby medical facility where he was pronounced dead. Ironically Tucker then resumed his renown rapid-fire repetitive rambling. “That’s the weirdest damned thing I’ve ever seen” said one physician. “Even with no apparent brain-activity his mouth just keeps on talking.”Chris "Friday" Tucker was considered a comedic genius with Oscar worthy performances in Fifth Element and House Party 3. The elusive icon of understatement has been in only a handful of movies in the last decade unlike the ubiquitous Samuel L. Jackson who HASN’T been in only a handful. “The world will sorely miss his great talent” said Rush Hour director Brett Ratner.The staccato tongued star had fallen on hard times last decade. Tucker bought a 10000-square-foot waterfront home on Lake Apopka at the height of the real estate boom just as Rush Hour 3 was opening in 2007. But he became indebted more than $4.4 million and was once in foreclosure. ”I think he was planning on working up until Rush Hour 8 and then retiring” said a close friend of Tucker’s who declined to be identified because he still owes Tucker money.Signs of continued money problems began to surface a few months ago when Tucker was spotted hustling cars at exit ramps with a sign reading “Will Talk for Food” and "Coming Soon: Rush Hour 4!" Despite repeated denials from co-star Jackie Chan regarding a sequel and hell freezing over Tucker continues to beat that former prize winning horse which apparently died during the filming of "Rush Hour 3".Persistent rumors about about a deal to make five more Rush Hour films to put Tucker back on top financially apparently came to a head last week when Jackie Chan flew all the way from Hong Kong to tell Tucker personally "Hell no!" But Chan's lack of mastery in contextual English particularly in the area of contracts resulted in Chan inadvertently agreeing to do five more films. That's when the fight started.Rush Hour 3 was originally supposed to be the last in the series.“Rush Hour 2 was released in 2001 and grossed more than $345 million worldwide. So we figured doing a 4th installment would make like a gazillion dollars in this creatively bankrupt entertainment market” said Robert Baron CFO of Soylent Films LLC and avid Chris Tucker fan.Despite Chan's adamant refusal to share the camera with Tucker's mouth ever again people had been working behind the scenes on a plan to do more Rush Hour films without him. It was when they announced that Jackie Chan was to be written out of any sequels and replaced by Owen Wilson in Asian make-up that the troubles truly began.A drunken Chan allegedly showed up at a meeting between Wilson Tucker and executive producers trying to Shanghai his character and threatened to kick the crap out of everybody with comedic flare. After a moment of silence Owens proclaimed “Well screw that!” and everyone present reluctantly agreed; but an ugly uneasiness between Tucker and Chan couldn’t be ignored."Chris is that you?" Chan slurred before being led away by security. " I thought it was Jimmy Walker. Damn you've really let yourself go!" he laughed.Jackie Chan had reportedly become distraught over his own mediocre movie career and envious of Tucker’s stellar success. Once an acclaimed stuntman in Hong Kong who began his career in Bruce Lee movies Chan’s first U.S. movie Battle Creek Brawl was cold-cocked at the box office; he recovered with bit parts in the highly successful Cannonball Run movies but then starred in a U.S. film called The Protector…which flopped.Chan took the idea behind The Protector and made a little known film out of it called Police Story. But besides eye-catching stunts innovative action and genuine comedic timing Chan brought little else to cinema with his combination of kung-fu and humor. He continued to languish in unremarkable films such as Snake in Eagle’s Shadow and the forgettable Drunken Master until he lucked into a once-in-a-lifetime role in Rush Hour.“We were initially looking to cast the highly talented David Carradine” said Ratner “But Carradine was hung up with previous commitments in Thailand so we threw this little-known Chan fellow an opportunity. We figured Tucker would bring his vast fanbase to the film and maybe Chan might get a little recognition for a change. We didn’t expect him to start a rumble in the Bronx! Chan could do 100 films and he’d still never be on par with Chris” added Ratner. “He’d be lucky to do juice commercials.”Chan was last seen eluding police down a New Jersey turnpike at high speed on a motorcycle. During the pursuit Chan reportedly jumped his bike over a drawbridge cleared a helicopter and landed the cycle on a gravel lane laid it down and slid under a horse-drawn carriage narrowly missing an oncoming bus before slamming headfirst into a guardrail.Waving that he was OK Chan got to his feet high-jacked a sports car and escaped down a drainage canal at high speed. According to one State Trooper “We are not impressed.”

Hooyah!”He anticipates a ten-minute standing ovation plus a few cannon shots. If the ovation lasts longer than ten minutes Biden will lapse into a River Dance back and forth across the stage.“Folks my granddaughter Dublin-Irish O'Malley asked me “Pops was he a clown?” and I said “Dublin-Irish with all that makeup eye white plastic hair baggy suit fat-tie and swinging overcoat I’d have to say yes!”There should follow another ten-minute ovation and perhaps more River Dance.“And folks when I have something to say I’ll come right out and say it face to face like a man and no more sneaky bone spurs peek-a-boo chicken liver tweets packed with grammar and spelling errors. And won’t it be great to have a first lady who can express herself without using the F-word two and three times in one sentence?”He’ll ask Jill to take a bow. She will.Then Biden will list all the actions he intends to perform Day One at the White House: Breakfast in bed of Irish grits. Then to the Oval Office and reverse all Trump policies introduced during the last horrendous four years. Take a two-mile swim in the Potomac. Then back to work.“Folks I’m going to make America the great nation it was before that clown stole the presidency four years ago from Hillary Clinton.”More applause.“Hooyah!”Read more by this author:

Wonton believes she earned the proceeds legitimately and is in full right of keeping them.Wonton was one of 10 female police officers who were chosen to go undercover as prostitutes in order to expose and breakup a sex trafficking operation that was believed to have been operating over the last 5 years in Paramus. The gang which ran the sex trafficking ring were known as the Pole Smokers. The undercover operative was named Operation Bottoms Up according to police documentation that was released by the court. Apparently the ring recruited individual prostitutes by promising them lucrative porn film movie roles. The gang would then have the prostitute dress in a Playboy Bunny suit and would film the prostitute’s actions with each client. They would pay the prostitute a portion of the money garnered from the transaction which in the case of the 10 undercover officers would than go to the Paramus Police Department.“I earned every cent of that money from my undercover work” lamented Wonton. “I was the one doing the 'humpty dumpty' with the John. I was the one 'pole-smoking'. I’m the one facilitating the cunnilingus. I earned that money and that money is three times of what I make from being a police officer. I am starting to think that I may be in the wrong business.”Other undercover officers have supported Wonton and they too want to collect the proceeds from their labor. They have filed a friend of the court brief in favor of Wonton.“They are police officers and police officers only” stated Paramus Police Chief Donny Oversight. “The money they make goes straight into the police department’s budget. Right now we need extra money so we can buy another militarized tank from the army. We only have three tanks as of now. We need more to be used when serving warrants at local residences. We are fighting this."When asked if the chief had made any arrests yet Oversight replied: “We are making a lot of money off of this operation so as of to date there have been no arrests.”As of press time Wonton had quit the police department to become a full-time prostitute.

He said:"It's very simple. 'Joe Biden' is an anagram of 'Joe in bed'. See? It's hardly rocket science!"Mr. Biden's real name is Joseph Biden and by a process of rearrangement of the letters in it 'Joseph in bed' can be arrived at.Not even outgoing president Donald Trump could argue with Woodson's straightforward logic.With Trump's history as someone who seems to treat women unfairly with little or no respect and regards them as mere objects he might prefer Mr. Biden's 'Sleepy' label rather than the one many non-admirers have fitted him with: 'Creepy Don'.

Sometimes especially in this lockdown period peoples 'screws' tend to be slightly looser. Others can keep their 'screws' tight but it depends on how people's 'nuts and bolts' are 'screwing!'A Dutch gentleman locked down in his apartment with his missus in Rotterdam felt his 'screw' was reasonably tight until his missus decided to get her skimpy black undies on to relieve lockdown boredom!Mijnheer Willem von de Brug aged 35 was busy working on his Home Office when his wife Yolanda crept into the office in her very sexy undies. She jumped on his laptop which was resting on his lap opened her thighs and pointed downwards. Willem in the middle of a video call with his boss an 85-year-old entrepreneur who deals in international antiques had a heart attack when he saw Yolanda splitting the waves to Utopia!Willem ignored his boss lying over his desk top laptop and did what all hot Dutch men do lost his 'screw' whilst 'screwing' his extremely hot wife.In these distressing times of lockdown quarantine social-distancing it is sometimes healthy to 'loosen ones screw' especially if the missus has a 'screw loose' too! However if you are living alone there's always a vibrator or a red-right-hand to loosen the 'screws!'

Our sources in the FBI are telling us it’s becoming increasingly difficult to locate them almost as if they were hiding somewhere in the US or in Russia.We’ve managed to get in touch with the representatives of the non-profit group “Women For White America First”. They were hesitant to talk to us but changed their minds after we bluntly asked the following question: “Did you have anything to do with organizing and orchestrating the riot and storming of the Capitol building on January 6th?”“I have absolutely no idea what you’re talking about” replied the representative of this fine group. “What Capitol what riot? On that particular date we were in our underground facility - it’s more like a cave actually - where we had stashed food and water for two years in case of a revolution or something. All of us white girls were busy watching WW2 propaganda documentaries about blond and blue-eyed German soldiers exercising in the Austrian Alps.”“And when you say capital which capital are you referring to? Paris France? I know they often have riots but that’s because they are socialists. The whole country is being run by the Chinese communist party.”“But you were seen and recorded on camera during the “Save America Rally” on Jan. 6th immediately before rioters stormed the Capitol building. Six people died.”“I’ve never heard of such an event. It’s fake news. Today’s technology allows anyone to create a video and embed people who weren't there. And the liberal communist media have been propelling baseless conspiracy theories about patriotic Americans trying to overthrow the government.”“What are your plans for the future?”“We’re waiting for the President to move in with the military and hang traitors.”

The President has now responded to these allegations.He denied that it was inappropriate for Bobo and Dingdong to enter the Sixth District Court in Ohio wearing red rubber noses and riding a children’s tricycles saying they “had a cold” and recent injuries which prevented them walking after they had ridden over each other’s large feet by mistake.He also denied that Rudy Giuliani had acted clownishly by removing his suit pants in a bedroom in front of a 15-year-old girl. Rudy had been “honey trapped” by British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen in his eponymous role as “Borat” who had sent his 15-year-old daughter to “interview” the former mayor of New York while being secretly filmed. The pair had gone into a bedroom in the hotel where Giuliani had laid on his back on the bed while the girl removed his pants. Trump insisted that Giuliani had worn “tight attorney pants instead of baggy clown ones and needed help getting them off to remove a microphone” before adding “not that he would have worn baggy pants since he isn’t a clown”.Trump is currently involved in a dispute with Giuliani about the size of his fee for attending children’s birthday parties.

I spent a long time in incubation and I'm not going to give up now!"Several vaccines on the market claim to be as much as 95% effective against the virus and experts were hopeful that with large-scale vaccinations worldwide the virus could be reasonably controlled. But the virus laughed-off this suggestion:"Control me? Over my dead body! I'm not through just yet! Fortunately there are other options open. Many humans are already refusing the vaccines and in any case I've already managed to mutate."And it had a stark message for humanity:"Economic recovery? Not on my watch!

Mr Ving is lying like a lot of people who write blogs and post images on Instagram.
Wednesday 20 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152097/85-of-americans-cant-name-who-the-president-was-yesterday,85% of Americans can't name who the President was yesterday,It is 2 hours after Joe Biden's inauguration as US President and a shocking survey has shown that the vast majority - over 80% - of Americans can't remember who was President this morning.Methew Jefferson 45 is an unemployed fast food restaurant worker. "Are you asking me who was President yesterday?" he asked rhetorically. "Do I look like a history professor to you?"Other Americans interviewed by TheSpoof were equally ignorant. Bill Crackhouse 22 is an unemployed grandfather. "Let me see" he said. "I remember he was bad-ass. As in he had this gigantic blubbery ass that looked really disgusting in every photo he was in. What a bad ass he had! His name I can't remember. President Fat-ass?"Vietnam vet and retired vet Yvette MDMA 61 could almost remember him. "He tried to get his followers to storm the capital building in Washington. You'd think I'd remember him after that but no it's gone. Wait was that just a movie I saw? He used to be on Twitbook I know that. Say do you want to buy some drugs?"

Someone who claims to like Jogging but does very little of it.For you it is a lifestyle choice not a way of life. I bet you also own a set of dumbbells that you never use as well don't you?

Unable to work or concentrate normally? Rushed to emergency units?AF: Oh all that goes away quite rapidly. I believe a few days should do it.INT: 55 deaths in the US? Deaths in Mexico Portugal India—BG: But due to people with underlying conditions! We can't honestly say whether the jab did it to them or what.AF: People die all the time. Let's not forget that.BG: I mean we have a health crisis here and and . . . we've got to have these lockdowns.INT: Woman 46 years old no previous health problems neurological damage can hardly walk?AF: There are always going to be exceptions.INT: So then 95% safe of 100 vaccinations would mean 5 not safe?BG: Ah let me do the math here.INT: 95% of 1000 vaccinations would mean 50 not safe? Meaning as we're investigating here all these adverse reactions?AF: Well we really need to define “not safe” a little further.INT: The 5% of one million vaccinations would mean 50000 not safe?BG: You know I really need to be getting back to the office.INT: 5% of a global population at 7.8 billion?AF: Thank you we'll get back to you at some point . . .The Pew Research Center poll on public confidence in the US Government “to do the right thing just about always” was 17% in 2019.

I feel that with another chance I would do it all differently.'America will see Donald Trump carry on the same line of thought every year knowing that the time has passed and sometimes all you need is one chance to ruin everything.America said: 'We had our time it was full of drama but really I was on the rebound after Obama a bit like I was with Nixon. The Bushes though that was a bad time too much alcohol and little impulse control.'

Who else could be behind last week's vandalism and ribaldry in the capitol?Was not the stolen laptop--with intent to sell it to the Russians--was that not proof enough?And what about Mr. Trump's phone records? Surely if released that walk he urged was a suggestion direct from the perspiring lips of Mr. Putin eager to have another go at bringing down America.Indeed as Ms. Pelosi said “All roads lead to Putin.”In fact isn't what happened enough to get up a new 9/11 Commission as with the previous attack on the United States 20 years back?Ms. Clinton: "Well as you say all roads . . ."Their discussion continued following the podcast according to an engineer in the studio (who must remain anonymous).“And take that boot on my desk” Nancy was saying. "Do you know how long it took me to scrub off the stains? My elbow still aches!”“Soviet style definitely! As with that ugly fellow wearing it?” from Ms. Clinton.“Not only that” assayed Ms. Pelosi. “You've heard about all these asteroids the size of The Empire State Building? Headed for Earth on inauguration day itself?”“Putin of course. Don't they have new battle systems we know nothing about?”“There it is! All roads don't you know?”Asked to comment on these developments Mr. Zuckerburg and Mr. Dorsey offered their views:Mr. Z: “Well there's conspiracy theory and then there's official theory.”Mr. D: “We don't do conspiracy theory only official theory. As with the 9/11 commission and 19 Arabs with box cutters. That thing.”Mr . Z: “Oh yes. Why US defense was unable to deal with those rogue planes over a span of about two hours is entirely explained in the official theory. Now as to the Trump administration and this capitol attack thing--”Mr. D: “We have to keep our eye on business relations. That's all it is.”Mr. Z: “Plus of course all roads . . .”Mr. D: “That's right! All roads lead to Putin—or maybe China. It's China now isn't it?”

He only opened the bog door so his wife could supply him with his favourite food local fried in wok veggies which keep his flatulent existence going at turbo speed.After reading a 1951 Guinness Book of Records left behind by famous Chinese explorer Lon Gon Loo he decided to sit on the bog and break the Guinness record for sitting on a bog recorded in 1945 by a Japanese soldier who locked himself in a bog on a remote Pacific island believing the war was not over and US GI's were searching for him. He sat there for 30 days surviving on cockroaches and other bugs until Man Friday dressed in a Hula Hula skirt appeared to inform him he was a total Nutter! In the interim he really was!Not being outdone by the Japanese again Wan Pong Poo took on the challenge and after sitting on his bog reading the thoughts of Chairman Mao backwards and forwards repeatedly news spread down the valley. Officials from Beijing decided to tell Guinness about this amazing record-breaking effort!They sent specialists to make sure poor old Wan Pong Poo was really locked in his bog and after 31 days needing a shower and smelling like a bunch of rotting Chinese roses he topped the Japanese Nutter's record!After being officially recorded in the famous book fame and fortune descended on Wan Pong Poo's village.

Boots the Chemist has offered their special creams to ease his pain and sent boxes to Wan Pong Poo for free including DHL postal costs as long as he sits on his bog once again to shoot a TV Ad for Boots and DHL ! He reluctantly agreed!

The former first lady then added tongue-in-cheek ”And troot be told tu ju Donaldo looks like a berry berry ugly fat-as-chit Marilyn Monroe.”

After all his own show The Apprentice was very much a lousy excuse to waste 60 minutes of their time. However he maintained that Kim Chloe and co were trying to make America great again and so deserved a better break.The pardon may have the horrible effect of the Kardashians who earlier this year said they wouldn't continue the series resuming production and pumping out more meaningless drivel than before.Such is life in modern America.

He knew that he had only minutes to spare his first 'online' lesson being due at a quarter to eight and as he pulled his yellow underpants up his eyes fell upon his telephone and he opened his Messenger service.This was a trifle premature.Students were already in the 'Zoom Room' waiting for their teacher to arrive."Good morning teacher!" came a cacaphony of voices.The scantily-clad teacher quickly turned his camera off so that he could remain unseen by his students but it may have already been too late.Students posted messages in the thread:"Look at teacher!"And:"He got no clothe!"Whilst one commented:"Kinky!"It's not yet known whether or not repercussions will follow.

"First his father-in-law conspired with Oswald then he committed election fraud in the 2016 Iowa Caucus against me. Now he tried to stop the election results in Congress what a loser!" continued Trump. "Did his wife improve her looks? I don't think so.""And then we have "Beanpole Josh" another loser. He's the one that signaled those nutjobs to attack the Capitol with that raised fist I had nothing to do with it. Very sad how that worked out."
Thursday 21 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/world/152106/pence-pardons-the-debate-fly-that-landed-on-his-head,Pence Pardons The Debate Fly That Landed On His Head,Washington D.C.- Vice President Mike Pence doesn't get the broad powers to pardon prison sentences for his sordid array of scumbag pals. Hell he doesn't even get to pardon the damn turkey.But on his last day in office Pence did take the time to make one very small pardon. Although not officially government sanctioned in any way the VP made the gesture anyway pardoning the fly that landed on his gleaming white hair and totally fucked up his debate night making him look like a fool for the next week in the liberal mainstream media.Although Pence couldn't be sure where the fly was now or what he'd been up to since the debate the good christian devotee took the nobel action to forgive the fly for ruining his debate night and probably costing the Republicans the presidency and most certainly ended his own chances at the highest office.The official pardoning ceremony was attended only by a few of his closest staff next to the dumpster out back of the White House. Aides threw bags of 'fly'-related mail and artwork that had been sent to the vice-president in mockery. Bags upon bags were heaved into the dumpster and lit afire by Pence himself. They held hands and sung a few hymns from the book of Mathew while the pile burned.The same fortunes could not be told for the person who after an intense investigation costing well over $1 million dollars was deemed to have let the fly into the auditorium in the first place. No that unfortunate delivery man who had propped the doors open while delivering jugs of water just a few hours before the debate was swiftly executed after a shadow military court hearing in Guantanamo Bay. The body was apparently buried at sea so as not to have a shrine for people to worship at.So Good for you Mike Pence. Glad to see you are able to move on from politics in any way shape or form.Adios amigo!And Gracias fly. We wish you well.(reporter's note: the trigger to the BBQ lighter was actually pulled by a senior staff member.)
Thursday 21 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152084/biden-spends-first-day-cleaning-up,Biden Spends First Day Cleaning Up,He may not have been in office very long but in today's rough-and-tumble environment of political shenanigans where things move quickly truth has become 'optional' and the victor is often the person who doles out the best nicknames Joe Biden is going to have his hands full.And it might only be one day into Mr. Biden's presidency but it's never too early to make an assessment of his work.We at TheSpoof.com thought it would be timely to assess the new president's performance thus far.Firstly Mr. Biden will forever hold a special place in people's hearts for getting rid of the previous White House incumbent whose name is on the tip of my tongue. Biden is seen as the opposite to that man: cool calm collected you might even say 'composed' whereas the 'other guy' was uncool anti-calm not collected and decomposed.Also he lied a lot.President Biden's first task this morning after he'd finished eating a bowl of muesli and milk washed down with some coffee like a normal human being instead of having a Big Mac and fries was to put right all his predecessor's clumsy mistakes.The erstwhile retarded thinking on immigration climate change race inequality and the Coronavirus all came under severe scrutiny and will be overturned in the coming days as if the former president himself were being thrown under the wheels of a bus.In a fitting end to his first day as POTUS Mr. Biden had a hot cup of cocoa brushed his teeth had a shower and went to bed - without accessing Twitter - falling into peaceful repose soon after.He seems to be quite reasonable whereas much of what Donald Trump did and said was treasonable.

As for Ginger-haired pussies well they're a riot!Famous Ginger Knobs include Paul Scholes ex-United superstar who banged them in with impunity even though he was born in Oldham (Where the fuck is that?). Rita Hayworth loved a good old fashioned Ginger Knob or two too!Ginger Rodgers also knew how to tap 'red-hot-splits' on the dance floor with balding Fred.Another famous Ginger Knob was Ginger Baker he also banged with impunity but that was on his drums and instead of being attracted to Ginger pussies he preferred giving them a bowl of Cream.A leading blond Swedish feline scientist Fru Johanna Johannsen confirmed the fact that Ginger Knobs tend to be more hyper-active than other rare-breeds. However she refuses to accept that balding men are any less active especially after stroking Ginger Pussies. The only problem is they are a very seldom race only to be found in northern areas of Scandinavia where red-hot-Ginger-Pussies are worshipped like Gefion a ginger-haired-red-hot-Goddess!

Trump tips the scales (literally) at 375 pounds.The tiny tot rapper had been convicted of printing counterfeit $3 bills bringing over 2000 illegal parrots into the U.S. from the Amazon jungle and operating a 747 without a license.Both iRumors and iNews report that they have no damn idea why the twice-impeached Nazi worshiper Trump pardoned the little bitty rapper since the two have never even met.Trump’s personal physician Dr. Yang Fu Fi told Kitty Segovia with iNews that the miniature singer paid the disgraced president $4.3 million to issue him a pardon.

But Bravo Network guru and man who knows everything about everyone Andy Cohen says he has a photo of Ted’s birth certificate which clearly shows he was born in Platanos Verdes Guatemala which is the mosquito capital of Central America.Even Fox News alarmist and man who makes Fred Flintstone look handsome Sean Hannity says that the flip-floppin' Ted Cruz has become more hated that jock itch yeast infections and Greg Gutfeld.

No more comb-over? No more distortions? No more misogyny name-calling pettiness rants and tweets?Did he really give it up? No more telephone calls to states to locate ten thousand or more votes so he could stay in office? Or other phone calls to find some dirt on Joe Biden’s son. And no cryptic messages to followers to start a revolution without him.Is the Trump nightmare really over? The send-off at Andrews Air Force base was a little sparse. A few cannons were fired but they had more smoke than boom. Trump didn’t look pleased before or while addressing the few there to send him off. Certainly Sean Spicer won't be announcing that it was the largest audience ever.His four older children were there with dates or spouses to kiss him good-bye and then they followed along the red carpet and boarded Air Force One.Whew!The world held its collective breath for the final departure of Donald Trump. Supporters may have called the election results the big steal but after Air Force One took off headed for Florida the nation and the world are experiencing the big exhale.Someone check the White House basement pantry to make sure he’s gone.Read more by this author:

Special to The Spoof. By late afternoon with the Inauguration festivities over and quiet descending on the press room at the White House correspondents from all the major wire services and media news outlets began asking each other what title should be used in referring to the former president Donald Trump."Since he was voted out of office by seven million votes" said the NBC correspondent "I'd refer to him as "The Unpresidented Donald Trump'.""I was going to suggest that too" responded Woof Blister from The Spoof "but in my version he's "Unpresidented" because he was impeached twice which has never happened before."The staid reporter for the New York Times chimed in: "We're a little more formal at The Times. He'll simply be 'Mr. Trump'.""That's not the way it's done in the American Legion Auxiliary" said an unidentified woman. "He'd be 'Past President Trump'."The man representing an academic publication the Chronicle of Higher Education offered: "How about calling him 'President Emeritus Trump'?"The correspondent wearing a military uniform from Stars and Stripes smiled: "No he's the 'Commander-in-Chief Ret'."A representative for the religious press ended the discussion: "He'll always be 'the Defrocked Former President'."At that point a message came in from the Biden press secretary noting that "the Ex-Prexy sends his regards to all of you."
Friday 22 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/152120/biden-s-surprising-new-executive-orders-stun-some-americans,Biden’s Surprising New Executive Orders Stun (Some) Americans,Apparently true to his word that he would not waste time merely legislating when executive orders would suffice President Biden has issued a new set of far-reaching orders that will fundamentally transform America.1. First the southern US border will be opened fully and immediately. “C.mon man” Biden was reported to have told advisors “we can’t keep 'em out so rather than risk a messy failure let’s be bold.” According to the Washington Post construction equipment is already en route to tear down the newly-built sections of wall as well as the old wall and any lingering fencing brush or other obstacles to entry. Pontoon bridges will be erected over the Rio Grande. Border checkpoints will be abandoned on the US side allowing a free northward flow. In a sop to north Americans troubled by the coming deluge Biden’s order also opens the border with Canada allowing Trump supporters to exit the US in a northerly direction.2. To create “lebensraum” or open space for the new arrivals Biden’s order places strict controls on reproduction by women from non-marginalized or privileged groups. For these women a new system of licenses will regulate permitted child-bearing and will be hard to come by without a degree from an elite Ivy League university. For couples rendered childless by the new statute but who wish nevertheless to have families the order further provides financial and other incentives to legally adopt immigrant arrivals. For example the Defense Appropriations Act now compels US corporations to divert manufacturing capacity to the production and donation of necessary goods including clothing tortilla flour refried beans backpacks sombreros and Mariachi band equipment.3. In the event of unplanned pregnancies in the wrong populations a third major order will grant the US Government the power to order illegally pregnant women to exercise freedom of choice. While this may sound ominous the Post admits in practice it is benign. For example the new Obamacare abortion mandate will be fully taxpayer-supported for the first unplanned pregnancy. Of course there will need to be a series of escalating penalties for each succeeding instance of unauthorized fertilization.4. To shield and soothe progressive sensibilities already bruised by the Trump presidency the fourth of the new orders proposes to rename certain states. Offended groups already busily rebranding offensively-named schools (e.g. Abraham Lincoln Elementary) sports teams (the Washington Redskins) and public facilities have eagerly answered the call. High on the list of states to be renamed is the state of New Mexico where the adjective “new” implies that there is or was something wrong with the original Mexico. Popular suggestions range from the simple expedient of dropping the “New” to more descriptive options such as “Mas Mexico” and “Mexico del Norte”. Other states will be renamed after icons of the new panoply of woke heroes; for example we may soon be referring to the new state of Kapernica instead of California while New York is slated to be renamed Cuomotopia.5. The final order directs the US Congress to reorganize state boundaries in order to maintain the number of states at fifty while admitting DC and Puerto Rico as new states. The idea here is to save tax dollars that would be incurred in designing and printing a new US flag with more stars. Proposals to admit DC (top state name suggestion: Hillaria) and Puerto Rico (Alexandriana) will require the offsetting consolidation of certain “red” states. For example Arizona and Nevada could be absorbed by the new state of Kapernica or Texas could be merged with Mas Mexico.In an concurrent editorial the Post editors express their hope that these far-sighted orders will go a long way toward solving the immigration crisis and at the same time put us on a path toward ending systemic racism. Even in these early not to say infantile days the Post is ready to applaud the Biden Administration’s surprisingly visionary bent. Citing unnamed but unimpeachable sources the Post cites as additional evidence for its visionary claims that Dr. Anthony Fauci has shared secret graphs showing how over time these new immigration and population control orders combined with the effect of the COVID pandemic will usher in a golden period of decline in non-marginalized populations that will last at least until they achieve marginalization and perhaps beyond.“Progress and the arc of history will not be deterred until all US citizens are members of marginalized groups. This is what progress is all about” one unnamed Biden official observed when asked about these reports. “People need to evolve and learn new ways of thinking. And if they can’t or won’t we will just have to get new people.”

I just can't find it anywhere! It was there earlier but it's just disappeared!"The Reds buried Crystal Palace 7-0 a month ago but have scored only one Premier League goal in their last five outings.Klopp moaned:"Ever since I took Mané off against Crystal Palace he's refusing to score and the fact that I relegated Salah to the subs bench that day has caused him to put his bottom lip out as well."A search is currently under way to try to locate the missing facility before Liverpool slide into the relegation zone.

The truck driver at his wits end attempted everything to free the truck to no avail.Then he had a brainwave! "Pigs love mud" he thought! "If I let them out they can grovel in the mud take the weight off my back wheels and then I can get out of the sticky mud! Then I'll reload them and nobody will know a thing!"He opened the rear doors of the trailer and the pigs super-intelligent as they are smelt freedom and bolted for it! "Sod the mud" they thought "I'm not ending up on anybody's barbecue!"In the interim the 'clever' driver managed to get his truck out of the mud hoping that his load of piggies would be enjoying themselves grovelling in the mud! He went to the back of his truck only to discover not a pig in sight!Later the farmer returned with his tractor stinking of dung and asked what the hell was going on and where were his pigs!The truck driver shrugged his shoulders told the farmer what had happened and why there were no pigs on board.Later that day a news report mentioned that car drivers should be careful just in case they hit a herd of pink pigs running for their lives in the direction a local veggie factory! After all pigs are highly intelligent and know where they are safe OINK OINK!
Friday 22 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152116/new-theory-of-politics-vigorously-denied-in-the-halls-of-social-media-and-congress,New theory of politics vigorously denied in the halls of social media and congress,Professor Floutus Dignit of MIT has just emerged to the world stage with a theory he calls “similar to the problem of delirium tremens in the old days.”The delirium tremens malady occurs as a consequence of withdrawal from alcohol with unpleasant side effects.In the present case according to Professor Dignit trauma is not so much caused by alcohol as it is by power and need for approval at the ballot box."Hysteria yes. Quite close."A wholesale delirium in the realms of exaggeration and delusion occurs which could continue for the entire length of an administration.An example is the recent deployment of 25000 national guards to the capitol at the time of Mr. Biden's inauguration.Clearly overkill in terms of actual danger plus accompanied by barbed wire and blockades similar to The Green Zone in Baghdad this action was set off by inadequate assessments following mob behavior earlier this month.Ms. Clinton's and Ms. Pelosi's calling that mob attack “sedition” and bringing charges against Trump as trying to create a “coup” are similar as delusion and exaggeration according to the professor.These behaviors also sometimes contain contradictions that the perpetrators seem unaware of.That pillar of health leadership Mr. Fauci has been caught in what some call prevarications on several occasions including on no need (then dire need) for masks and the number (increasing) that should be vaccinated to get to a safe zone.Official statements on mask wearing have been continually ignored by officials themselves who have been putting out mandates with the latest inconsistencies from Mr. Biden himself and his family.Moreover inconsistencies are occurring on estimates of damage from covid as with currently the 400000 deaths. A year ago the estimate was 2 million by June of 2020.Further the 400000 figure is not qualified in terms of age or even whether covid was the leading cause of demise (the was it covid with or from question).The WHO has just revealed the problem of "false positives" related to reports of an increasing number of cases.In short Professor Dignit says either politicians today are continuously lying or they are ignorantly afflicted with a delirium that favors exaggeration and delusion.In which case a majority of them need medical assistance and psychoanalysis.Professor Dignit has also said he will not take to social media with this analysis given the hostility there.He will content himself with an academic audience which typically draws 6 in an auditorium for 500.

We have to play it as though we are on different teams. But we're not. You're like a brother to me really.Thing is it is and never was about me. I'm not that different as you know.No. It was always about my base my fans who can get a little rowdy.(I mean they scared the hell out of Washington and they brought in 25000 National Guard! Then looked silly as hell for doing this!)Now Joe I've been through the routine in the Oval Office which is like having people step on your toes all the time and they're doing it to get to you and blow your cool.Take my advice Joe and there's plenty more available! Let me help you.Give up on this “Give me a break man” response you do. It just doesn't sound presidential.I mean suppose they had questioned Napoleon on one of his campaigns. Would he have said “Give me a break man”? I don't think so.(Plus Joe there are tanning lamps in the White House attic. You look a little pale man. Maybe dying your hair blue or green would also help).Now Joe if this Oval Office thing is too exhausting (and it is!) keep in mind you can always come here to Mar-al-Lago.We'll give you a residence on the house. We could hit the links together.And one more thing Joe. I can get Melania to give Jill some fashion tips if you like.You know having a FLOTUS at the quality of a top New York model does add luster to the office (plus gets votes).Fraternally Joe old budDonald

He said:"The word 'mmng-geh' and the sound made when saying it were very interesting. Indeed it brought back memories of the way Wayne Rooney used to say 'erm'. Very odd."The interviewer asked Sotnikov about Comrade Navalny's return to Russia. He replied:"I think that mmng-geh Sam is right that mmng-geh Navalny is not going to stay in Berlin and mmng-geh hide away somewhere in Europe..."Asked if Mr. Putin was nervous about Mr. Navalny Sotnikov said:"Mmng-geh it could be so because probably on the er mmng-geh mmng-geh coming up of the presidential elections on the mmng-geh more mmng-geh space for President Putin to er ur have these mmng-geh so-called ...The interviewer and the other two interviewees Mr. Soloviev and Mr. Greene could be seen trying to stifle laughter.It was very funny.

After fumigation with Lysol Clorox and Klieg lights is it safe? Is America back?You bet!Seeing three real former Presidents together at the January 20 inaugural and a fourth that should have been a President was an example of bringing the nation back to normal.There was a gratifying whew that followed. After hearing the various congratulations from heads of state worldwide they also seemed to express the same whew.Joseph R. Biden is now the new President of the United States.But nothing was more demonstrative of the power and beauty of the United States than the sight of the Washington Monument lit up by a splendid display of sparkling fireworks on the evening of the inauguration.A photograph of that sight could be a New Year card Valentine card Birthday card 4th of July card Christmas card Get Well card Wedding Graduation Birth Announcement an 'every situation' kind of card.The monument seemed to smirk I've always been here keeping an eye on things.My country right or wrong.

According to Tory MP Iain Duncan-Smith he wishes he was 22 again so that he could take advantage of those opportunities and start "buccaneering" again.But a pirate ship is no place for a bald old man with illiberal views so Duncan-Smith's grandson Geoffroy Duncan-Smythe-Duncan-Smith-Crump aged 22 will take his place.He will serve on the pirate ship Jolly Rogering which launched from Portsmouth this week and will head to the Caribbean. Once there it will establish a secret pirate base and begin privateering - raiding other vessels for sugar and rum - and sending booty back to the UK or burying it in a nearby tax haven.More buccaneering ships are due to be launched soon in the first wave of what has been billed as "Global Britain's comeback".Other countries including the US have warned their navies to be on the lookout for an old sailing ship manned by amateurs wearing pantomime costumes. If the Jolly Rogering attacks other ships then they will likely meet a heavy response from modern warships who have little tolerance for piracy.Iain Duncan-Smith was aroused at the ship's prospect. He beamed as he said "It's what Brexit is all about."

As was the assistant teacher.He tried holding his breath and then when this failed went over and stood by the open window inhaling huge gulps of fresher air from outside. When a female student put her hand up to ask a question Kenwood bade her come over to the window in order to avoid being overcome by the fumes.When she did however the fumes came with her and the owner of the stinking feet was discovered.Just then the bell sounded for the end of the lesson and clasping his bag in both hands Kenwood bolted for the door.Showing how much he cared for the welfare of others he left it wide open.

Today President Biden announced that he is replacing Christopher Wray with a man who has no boundaries a man who can’t be bought.Who is this masked man and why would he be chosen to replace the man chosen by Donald Trump to overhaul the FBI?Connect the dots. Inexplicably deep down President Biden yearns for the days of law and order; where cross-dressing and hard-nose enforcement of the law went hand and hand. James Comey tried this formula and failed. How many times had he unlocked the J Edgar Hoover Memorabilia Room and chosen his outfit for the day? This was where Hoover’s feather boas high-heel sneakers dresses and capes were stored. The whole room reeked of cigar smoke and cheap foo-foo juice.It was difficult to blame Comey for trying to emulate the iron-fisted Hoover. Even though Comey had lost control of the FBI how was he to know that the Love Birds - Peter Strzok and Lisa Page - were a hosin’ and a blosin’ while trying to assist the Democrats in their impeachment of President Trump?Although Comey’s replacement seemed to be a square-jawed no nonsense guy he achieved absolutely nothing in his tenure. It was time for a change.Enter the man who has no known friends. Even his dog doesn’t like him.

Trump wanted 10 free tickets so he and his family could attend the upcoming Pensacola 300 Race.The NASCAR board of directors took a vote and it came out 9 to 1 to ban the new citizen of Mar-a-Lago from all future NASCAR races because racing fans hate liars more than they hate Thanksgiving etiquette.Board member Eunice V. Millabrew who has just gotten off probation for hen rustling said she spoke for the 8 other nay voters who want the disgraced sexual pervert to not even get within two miles of any NASCAR race track.Member Rufus Gigglerock who is a life long Republican and has the biggest ping pong ball collection in Florida went further and said that if he even smells a Trump in the vicinity he will personally call the sheriff and have them all evicted and fined $14000.Most NASCAR fans who live in trailers now literally hate Trump and his lying band of arrogant conceited privileged pieces of crocodile shit children; especially Don Jr. aka "Dopey."Buckaroo Kazoo with The Turnstile Review stated that Trump demands to know why he and his family are being discriminated against; especially since they're white privileged and rich-as-shit.He was told that there are 18 reasons but the main one is because they are all just totally fucked up beyond fixing.Sports Territory Magazine reported that popular race car driver Tucky "Bubba" Dippdoddle remarked that he heard that the guys in the white frock coats are out looking for Donald Donald Jr and Eric Trump so that they can escort the three shitheads to the nearest funny farm.

Are you two-timing me now that there’s a new Joe in town?”“Sweet Potato you know I wouldn’t do that. The invite is all part of the Keep your friends close cliche. You however are more than just a friend. You are a grand slam home run with bases loaded.”“Thank you Bubbles! How did you like Blimpo?”“The man was so uncoordinated. We had to give him a straw to drink his tea. He did try to come up at-bat but Philip sent him back down to the dugout like greased lightning.”“Goodman Philip.”“But I understand the new president can perform an excellent ten minutes River Dance take a break by doing the spoons then finishes up with a combined spoon and River Dance routine.”“And he also sings Oh Danny Boy afterward.”“Well he sounds multitasked so he won’t need a straw to drink his tea.”“Bubbles I hear Michelle coming.”“I’ll catch you later Sweet Potato.”End of conversation.Read more by this author:
Monday 25 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/uk/152131/confounded-man-quarantined,Confounded Man Quarantined,A local man was admitted to a local hospital early today complaining of discombobulation and confusion. "I don't know what the f**k happened!" he said from his hospital bed. "Just a few minutes earlier I was fine. Next thing I knew I was flat on my ass confounded!"Word of the man's confounding spread like a virus resulting in the man being quarantined at his residence until more is known about the outbreak. Authorities are also said to be looking into possible links between this case and an outbreak of "total disillusionment' that struck Washington D.C. a few days earlier."This is more than a mere case of abject confusion so we are taking this potential case of confounding very seriously" said the local emergency response manager. "We have not only isolated the man physically but are also socially isolating him." The emergency manager further explained that "Patient Zero" would not be allowed access to social media or to speak with anyone until the exact confounding route of transmission is determined. "He does not need to be communicating with people and confounding them too" said the manager.Preliminary test results eliminated a common case of flabbergasted. "A dose of Flabbergast X would have fixed that" said a unidentified physician. "Results similarly came back negative on perplexed and bewildered. So we're basically back to square one."The confounded man is said to be resting comfortably in isolation to reduce further spread. But some suggest the crisis is bogus. 'We've never seen an outbreak of confounding in our entire contrived convoluted history" said one political advocate holding a protest in the stricken local man's front yard. "We've been had. We've been took. We've been hoodwinked. Bamboozled. Led astray. Run amok! But not confounded. There is no confounding outbreak just a wtf moment. It's all a hoax!"In an unrelated story stupidity has been classified as a preexisting condition and not subject to medical coverage. According to experts failure to remain informed is a preventable condition.

Trump said that he wouldn’t touch her with Rudy Giuliani’s weiner. And Trump’s alleged girlfriend Maria Bartiromo commented that the ugly bitch looks like an asshole with teeth.One of Taylor Greene’s goals is to get every elephant in America castrated.When asked why she replied that those big old humongous things eat way too many peanuts and that has caused the price of Peter Pan peanut butter to triple just since September.Another of her pet projects is for the United States government to pay a portion of the cost of KKK hoods and robes.And just a few days ago she commented to Tucker Carlson that she wants for every male over the age of 18 who resides in California to get a vasectomy.When asked why she remarked that the number of Democrats would go down.TMZ is reportedly checking Taylor Greene's DNA because it's quite possible that she could be Donald Trump's biological sister.

Kitty then added that Jen is not at all fat like "Sponge Cake Sarah".Jen commented that after each press conference she’ll have a drawing for a very nice door prize.She pointed out that some of the prizes will include 65-inch big screen TVs Jet Skis $200 gift certificates to Victoria’s Secret and 7-day and 7-night all-inclusive trips to exotic locations like St. Croix Hawaii Cabo San Lucas Mexico and Dubai India.When asked if the taxpayers will be funding all of these fantastic amenities Jen replied that it will not cost the taxpayers one single dime.“Then who is paying for all of these wonderfully amazing door prizes Jenny?” asked the Fox News douchebag reporter.She smiled and said that every single item will be paid for by an organization known as The Two Rich Guys.CNN reporter Jim Acosta asked “Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos?”“Bingo!” replied the beautiful redhead.
Monday 25 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152154/melania-calls-the-shots,Melania calls the shots!,Re-settling in his beloved Florida is proving the next great hurdle for poor old Donald Trump.Melania is not amused and is patently seeking to rule the roost. Go carts are a no-go for the Slovenian model so she has to walk or rather strut everywhere. And since almost all inhabitants are old folk meeting anyone under 70 is difficult. But hey that's Florida!She refuses to join her husband at bridge evenings and shuns the daily 'Jogging for Geriatrics' during which participants stop every 100 yards to down Margaritas and Fuzzy Navels. The course of 1 mile usually takes them 3 hours. She enjoyed Bingo but the couple have now been banned since Trump failed to win the first prize of a pill dispenser with timer claiming the numbers were stolen and sent in the Proud Boys to 'roughen up' the caller.Her husband has placed traditional plastic Flamingoes on the front lawn but Melania has acquired two blackbelted pigs and a herd of alpine ibex from her homeland - those with the beautiful horns - to roam in the garden. Mountains are sparse so the ibex climb to the top of any building they can find much to the joy of locals.And there's friction in the kitchen too. Now that White House staff are not present Melania does the cooking herself. Trump normally goes for shrimp and grits followed by key lime pie but the former First Lady prefers kranjska klobasa and strukli from her native cuisine which actually taste better than they sound."I can't even pronounce 'em let alone eat 'em" complained the hobby conniver. "But I'm working on our return" he said chewing on boiled peanuts."And 2024 will be our year" he cried whistling 'Florida where the sawgrass meets the sky'. "And this time only Republicans will be eligible to vote! Or maybe I'll form my own party The Nationalist Numskulls'."You'll still lose" snarled Melania.Asked if there was anything she missed from the White House her response was prompt."The bodyguards of course! They were all so obliging..." she smiled.
Monday 25 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152153/analysts-say-senators--erection--mistake-a-sign-of-dementia-among-democrats,Analysts say senator's “erection” mistake a sign of dementia among Democrats,Curious as it may be Mr. Trump's coming impeachment trial has aroused Democrats in unexpected ways.Speaking on the senate floor about Mr. Trump's upcoming trial Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer recently stated:“Make no mistake there will be a trial and when that trial ends senators will have to decide if they believe Donald John Trump incited the erection against the United States.” He then corrected himself to “insurrection” versus “erection.”A clumsy gaffe only?Comments such as “They really have a h*rd on for this thing” from politicians here and there in the halls of congress may be relevant.The “smoking gun” (note phallic imagery here) causing Democrat arousal in this case is the accusation that Mr. Trump “incited” a mob to “insurrection and a coup against the United States.”Democrats are generally overjoyed with these developments.TDS (Trump Derangement Syndrome) seems near its climax—although a deeper problem in the nation's government may be surfacing.That is physical arousal while considering a case may interfere with thinking and decision-making.Further peculiar the types of stimuli range from abstract matters such as trials to "phallic perpetuating" images.Explosive developments sometimes follow.Mr. Biden is being urged to form a special investigation on this matter.At stake is not merely Mr. Trump's trial but the reasoning faculties of those now in charge—including dealing with the virus and locking down the populace.Further in Mr. Schumer's case there is a history.Analysts indicate Mr. Schumer's biography shows a certain tendency which began well back in his boyhood.A syndrome known to school boys as “the jigglies” occurs just as a boy is about to step off the school bus at his stop on the way home.That is a child's member inexplicably rises right at the crucial moment he must stand up. An awkward hunched-over posture then occurs as he exits.The problem is no advance warning or presence of stimuli usually associated with arousal and lengthening this area of the anatomy.Theorists speculate Mr. Schumer's gaffe was likely a warning that a corresponding part of his anatomy was at that very moment engaging in its own form of erection (that is insurrection!)Mr. Schumer's hunched-over stance at the podium and when he retires from speaking may not be “stomach cramps” as previously thought.Whether additional members of the Democrats may suffer from this disabling pre-direction (that is predilection!) must also be considered.

Other than that we are fine out in our natural habitats. I mean we blend easily into the heather and the grass but sometimes we are seen which is when we are caught.'Professional haggis hunter Angus McCoatup said: 'They are a right timorous beastie but come November I am out there with my sporran and kilt driving them out with my atonal bagpipe music.'
Monday 25 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/world/152146/paper-was-stuck-to-pie,Paper Was Stuck To Pie,In news that is sure to come as a bombshell to those in culinary circles a man has revealed how a pie he bought from a bakery at dinnertime today had become stuck to the greaseproof paper casing upon which it was sat.Moys Kenwood 57 purchased the tasty-looking Sausage Pie from a city center bakery outlet and licked his lips as he hurried all the way back to the school where he 'works' in anticipation of devouring the savory treat.No sooner had he opened its styrofoam tray however than he noticed the pie and the paper were unable to move independently of each other and sliding his fingernail between the two to separate them proved in vain.This presented a dilemma.Faced with the options of returning to the shop for a replacement throwing the pie in the bin or just getting on and eating it - paper and all - he chose the latter and bit down into it.His earlier anticipation had now been succeeded by trepidation.Later he told reporters that he wished he hadn't bothered. He said:"I wish I hadn't bothered. It tasted like it had been left over from the day before. Very very bland and unsausagelike."And the greaseproof paper?"It was its redeeming feature" he admitted.
Monday 25 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/entertainment-gossip/152126/man-makes-breakthrough-in-18-month-old-sudoku,Man Makes Breakthrough In 18-Month-Old Sudoku,There were celebrations in one household this afternoon when a man who started a Sudoku puzzle from the newspaper nearly 18 months ago but stopped trying to complete it when it became rather too difficult made a chance inroad which may ultimately lead to its solution.Moys Kenwood 57 began the giant 5×5 puzzle published in the Hull Daily Mail on the 29th August 2019 at his mother's home in Hull England but struggled from the start.Each of the 25 large squares contain 25 cells and must be completed using the letters K to Z and the numbers 1 to 9. Instead of the regular 81 Sudoku cells the giant puzzle requires 625 cells to be filled.Kenwood pored over the grid for hours days weeks and months until he was sure he wouldn't be able to progress any further and put it with some other papers in a storage box. On Sunday however searching for something in the box he spied the Sudoku and decided to give it another shot.The breakthrough came almost immediately as looking at Square 17 he saw that letter Z could ONLY be entered into cell number (reading from top to bottom left to right) because vertically Square 2 already had a Z in column 2 Square 7 already had a Z in column 1 Square 12 already had a Z in column 3 and Square 22 already had a Z in column 5. This meant that the Z in Square 17 had to be in column 4!At this point in time the number 4 in cell number 14 of Square 17 had not yet been entered and so the column 4 cell numbers 14 19 and 24 were empty. Z had to go in one of those!It couldn't go in cell number 14 in row3 because there was already a Z in row 3 in Square 16 (in cell number 12 for those interested) and it couldn't go in cell number 19 in row 4 because there was already a Z in row 4 in Square 19 (in cell number 20) so the only cell left for it to go into in row 4 of Square 17 was cell number 24!Kenwood was overjoyed!With this discovery and because there was already a Z in row 1 of Square 20 (cell number 4) another in row 4 of Square 19 (cell number 20) one in row 2 of Square 18 (cell number 8) and the newly-discovered Z in row 5 of Square 17 (cell number 24 remember?) the Z in Square 16 had to be in row 3!Row 3 of Square 16 then had two empty spaces: in column 2 and column 5 - cell numbers 12 and 15 respectively. However looking up Kenwood could see that in Square 6 row 5 in cell number 10 there was already a Z! This meant that Square 16's Z had to be in row 3 column 2 - cell number 12!He carefully wrote it in. Now he was on a roll.Vertically Square 1 had a Z in column 3 at cell number 8; Square 6 had a Z in column 5 at cell number 10; Square 16 now had its Z in column 2 at cell number 12. This left either column 1 or column 4.Square 21 at the bottom left corner could not have Z in column 4 because of other Zs on row 2 in Square 22 and on row 3 in Square 24. This meant that Square 21's Z had to be in column 1 and that of Square 11 had to be in column 4.It was getting exciting!There were two empty spaces on column 4 - the cells at cell number 4 on row 1 and at cell number 24 on row 5. Looking to the right Kenwood saw that Square 12 next door already had a Z on row 5 in cell number 23 and this settled it! The Z in Square 11 had to be in row 1 at cell number 4!Now he was cooking!His eyes fell upon the number 5 in Square 2 in column 1. Looking vertically Square 7 had a 5 in column 5 Square 12 had a 5 in column 3 and Square Square 22 had one in column 2. That meant the number 5 in Square 17 had to be in column 4. In that column there were two free spaces in row 1 at cell number 4 and in row 4 at cell number 19. Further aling that row in Square 18 there was already a 5 so Square 17's number 5 had to go in row 1 at cell number 4.Two more discoveries followed: a Y in Square 17's cell number 3 and an S in Square 20 at cell number 20.Said Kenwood:"It's not everybody's 'cup of tea' but I like Sudoku and it's true what they say about patience and persistence."

Enter at your peril if one suffers from Arachnophobia!After months of poetical protest Jaggedone aided by his team of 'Cockroach Infiltration Army' foot soldiers have at last persuaded The Spoof management team to send a squad of 'Spider Busters' into the dense filled with green moss dark abyss to eradicate the cobwebs out of the joint.Arachnophobia experts say spiders can only spin their webs if there is much love and warmth in the house! Well these forums definitely prove scientists wrong because there aint no love or warmth there anymore! So spiders grabbing their chance have spun their webs so thick and entangled nobody with an inch of satirical off the cuff humour in their weird brains would dare enter!A squad of 'Spider Busters' will enter as soon as Covid-19 allows mind you readers their suits look the same as our fabulous hospital staff workers doing a fantastic job all over the globe but that's too serious this particular chemical-cleaning-operation is just for a laugh Ha bloody Ha!Many UK writers blame their US colleagues for 'Trumping' up the cobweb process because too many 'Trumps' would give anybody the 'Hump'. Luckily 'Trumping up Trump' is now history and once the place has been chemically cleaned of all cobwebs related to this rather pathetic satirical character there is now room for innovative funny entertaining Beatles and other Bugs to take the place over!PS: Please Jaggedone we beg you not another reference to that sad city perched on the edge of the Irish Sea they have suffered enough!

Dottie Bazooka with Sports Balls Illustrated noted that Tom the Terrific played like he can still play for 2 or even 5 more years.He said after the game that he knows he's 43 but his body still thinks he's 23.Brady who will one day be the governor of Florida laughed as he said that he usually drinks about 10 bottles of Papaya Gatorade during a game but this time he only drank two bottles.Gisele Bundchen's husband did mention tongue-in-cheek that the nachos he ate at the half really hit the spot. He noted that he did decide to pass (no pun intended) on the pico de gallo hot sauce.Buccaneers’ coach Bruce Arians remarked that towards the middle of the fourth quarter Tom was feeling so good and so confident that he actually saw saw him working a crossword puzzle as he sat on the bench.Meanwhile on the other side of the field Aaron Rodgers was sitting on the bench reading a script for an upcoming State Farm commercial.After the game Rodgers was asked how he felt. He replied that he felt fine and proudly pointed out that he had already memorized his State Farm lines.When asked how he felt about the game that the Packers had just lost Aaron simply said “Oh the game? Well like they say in Seattle you win some you lose some.”The Tampa Bay Buccaneers will now host the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LV at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa Bay.

Besides Trump has bills to pay and jail to avoid.He’ll crank up his Slovenian wife and take her with him along with the other center part ladies with the waist-length flat-ironed hair.

Pence also attended the Biden/Harris inauguration at the Capitol. A regular act but Trump didn’t participate. Trump suffers from the sore loser syndrome.However in payback Pence didn't attend Trump’s very sparse send off to Florida. Rumor has it that Trump had incited the mob to go after Pence who didn't overturn the election and give it to Donald Trump.Pence was trapped in the Capitol Building along with House and Senate members and a killer mob outside breaking through the doors chanting "Hang Mike Pence!" The Capitol Police called for help. Their call for help was bounced around and ignored.More than a little pissed Pence got on the telephone and demanded action.

He considered as many local 'gentlemen' do pissing up a wall in a shop doorway up a tree behind a bush or indeed anywhere else that is not a toilet but his civilized upbringing tapped him on the shoulder and wagged an admonishing finger in his direction.Instead he sought out and eventually tracked down some public toilets that had already seen better days 10 years ago and had gone downhill since then.He rushed in and spotting a free space at the urinals he made for it. Now desperate he ripped open his zip and pulled out his tool but as he did so he could no longer hold back the piss and it sprayed this way and that in the style of a fireman's hose or the incoming tide smashing against a sea wall.The man standing next to him recoiled in terror as he trousers took the brunt of the deluge as Kenwood looked on apologetic yet relieved.The Englishman then washed his hands and went to finish his shopping.

We couldn't lay a finger on anything. It was absolutely ridiculous!"Other revellers were of a similar opinion. One Kirsty Lightfinger said:"Every time I went to pick something up I was told not to. There was a painting I was looking at. He didn't elaborate very much. Just plain and simple told me not to touch it. Over and over and over again!"Another partygoer said he left the bash early after he experienced problems when he wanted to use the toilet. James Rick said:"I needed to take a dump but he saw me and as my hand hovered over the restroom door handle he went into one of his frenzied dance routines and told me not to touch it - several times. I had to go out into his garden and shit in some bushes!"MC Hammer is 73.

With the departure of Donald Trump and recent gains by Democrats in the Senate progressives had expected Antifa and others to refrain from their black block outings now that Biden had won and the goals of social justice were coming to fruition.Embarrassed local authorities have pledged new tougher policies against lawbreakers. On Saturday Seattle's interim police chief Adrian Diaz announced a new agreement with the city attorney to ramp up arrests against vandals following outrage over damage to a federal courthouse in the city."The events of breaking windows at a variety of different locations with no meaning …cannot happen" Diaz said angrily. "There was no discussion about what they were fighting for what type of social-justice message. We are going to immediately address those issues."According to a spokesperson for the new chief who clarified his remarks in a subsequent briefing Seattle police will not arrest and prosecute protestors who break windows set fires or attack pedestrians or police as long as there is a clearly articulated social justice message that gives meaning to direct action and legally transforms violent acts into protected speech. In order to assist protestors in their messaging activities the Seattle Police department will henceforth distribute free cans of spray paint sign boards sharpies and helpful lists of approved social justice slogans prior to or in the course of future riots.Slogans like “No justice no peace” “black lives matter” “all cops are bastards” etc. will all automatically qualify as valid excuses for any linguistic rioting articulate violence redemptive vandalism and metaphorical assault that arises in the course of an otherwise entirely peaceful protest. Gratuitous anti-ex-president Trump slogans will further reduce the length of pre-release detainment and qualify for one free in-custody sandwich and a Starbucks latte.Unidentified Twitter-based spokespersons for Antifa claimed that despite what appear to be accommodating police policies the cops are still being bastards in that several signboards with woke slogans were present at the sites they had attacked. “It wasn’t our fault that the f…ing cops set off all that harmful and polluting smoke and tear gas. No one could see shit” one complained.

James got 26 no-calls in a 115-108 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers along with 46 points 8 rebounds 6 assists.The 4-time league champion who is third all-time in points scored and eighth in assists said after the game "the no-call record is the career achievement I've worked hardest to earn." In an interview with Charles Barkley James said: "credit is due to myself playing the game I love with great teammates and blind referees for 18 years. When I'm done balling I'm going to be able to tell my kids about every one of those 25115 missed calls in great detail."The Cavaliers' JaVale McGee set the mark by challenging James on a layup with 3:53 remaining in the 3rd quarter. McGee looked bemused on the side-line and could be heard saying to teammates: "I didn't know what the hell 'Bron was doing first yellin' at the referee and then shoutin' with joy and everyone high-fivin' him."The game was momentarily halted while James received lukewarm applause from the limited number of fans in attendance. James saluted the crowd and proceeded to stare at the three offending referees while making an eyeglass gesture with his forefingers and thumbs encircling his eyes.

Trump,Hearing that Donald Trump had designs running for the Russian presidency Vladimir Putin lost his usual X-KGB cool. Dismissing his feigned pause during rolling expressionless translations Putin exploded and immediately blasted Trump for his threatened candidacy to campaign and run against him in the next Russian election. KAPOW!If it can be called one the conversation resorted to name-calling with Putin calling Trump fatso. At the same time Trump referred to Putin as twerp.Somehow both miraculously managed to secure accurate verbal descriptions of one another.After Putin suggested that Trump could not even speak Russian adding in a sarcastic aside though Trump also struggled with the English language Trump hung up on Putin in a hissy fit.Doubly enraged Putin promised to have his Oligarchs call in all of Trump’s loans mortgages utility grocery and shoe repair bills and have Trump evicted from Mar-a-Lago and rename it Putin-a-Lago.Then Putin also promised to reveal how some ne'er-do-wells in his government (who have already been executed) illegally collaborated in the 2016 election which was won honorably by Madame Hillary Clinton but given to Trump with Trump’s knowledge acceptance and continuous gratitude in return for apartments in Trump Towers along with lifelong membership at all of Trump’s golf courses.“Take that Fatso!"Donald Trump announced instead to run for a seat in the House of Commons in Parliament."Fatso is going to need two seats!”Read more by this author:

Seniors Caught Exchanging Explicit Photos,Leisure Land Senior Village Laguna Beach CA. Special to The Spoof. Authorities here are cracking down on a ring of seniors - men and women - who have been using computers in the community library to circulate what are referred to as overly explicit personal photos legally described as senile pornography. Several arrests were made today but no charges have been filed as of this evening."We were only doing what our great grandkids do all the time" said Mabel a 90-year-old female resident. "I thought it was fun and Harold was elated when he got my pics." She made her comment when interviewed at the rec hall where several of the elderly residents had gathered to discuss the arrests.After considering a recall of the elected sheriff they connected with the ACLU. Some of the seniors displayed their suspected elicit photos. Mabel offered one that the sheriff had not seized. "Here's that famous photo of Harold in the nude."Amid gasps from the other women present Mabel held up the picture for all to see."Yes Harold's nude but the photo only shows him from the waist up. I guess it was his belly button that disturbed the sheriff." Harold was clearly visible in the picture as were his plavix bruises large but irregular-shaped blackish-purple blotches on his torso caused by the blood thinner. Several of the women turned their heads away when the photo was first posted but eventually took a slight glance at it."That must be why Harold never takes his shirt off when he sits by the pool" said one. "It's yucky" said her companion.Mabel then offered a photo of herself one that she had sent via email from the library computer to Harold. In it Mabel was visible only from the waist down her brief discreetly in place."My God Mabel I didn't know you had such ugly varicose veins" said another elderly woman. "You meed to see a doctor."Mabel responded: "That's why when you see me with Harold at the pool I'm always wearing full length jeans... and he has his shirt on!"At this point the ACLU lawyer arrived and looked at the two photos Mabel had displayed. "This isn't pornography" he ruled. A sigh of relief came from most of those present. "However these ought to be banned. They're beyond gross."

He takes up the story:"Well I was just watching where I was going really. You have to be careful where you're putting your feet don't you? There are unseen dangers lurking everywhere - stones bottles used diapers dog turds that sort of thing."In his path a bottle top loomed."I saw it and for some inexplicable reason I had an unquenchable desire to step on it to crush it and to flatten it into submission and out of existence. It felt right."It may have been what is known as a 'power trip'. He said:"It may have been what is known as a 'power trip'. I felt better afterwards knowing that this sad lonely bottle top had been obliterated but I'm not really sure why."Experts have said that the case is a philosophical and metaphysical question of why Kenwood felt an air of superiority over the innocent bottle top and was so inclined to destroy it.One said:"It's possible he has some issues."

"It doesn't surprise me in the least. I mean just look at his untidy hair and his untucked shirt. Was there any doubt that he was a Muppet? And I'll just bet pounds to pudding that his father is non other than Animal.""I'd have to see him play a drum kit" added Alan Picklesmoocher also of Coxinghamshire after hearing his neighbour's paternal hypothesis. "To me he's always looked a lot more like Rowlf the Dog don't you reckon?""That's a complete load of poppycock" told Edith Claptrapper "Anyone with eyes can see that he's a dead ringer for the Swedish Chef. And on top of that apparently Boris is a complete disaster in the kitchen—food everywhere. So there you have it."So while wild speculation commences as to which male Muppet might be Johnson's father we couldn't find one person who questioned who his mum might be. "Well it's right there in the last line of Kermit's new song" pointed out Ms. Claptrapper. "Every Muppet with balls knows a pig who'll get sleazy for a plate of strawberries and chocolate."Rumours are now swirling about a possible Johnson appearance in the next Muppet caper movie which is set to arrive in theaters next summer titled: The Muppets Fuck Up Europe."I'll bet pounds to pudding he's in that one" said Ms. Whizzletooter.
Wednesday 27 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/152172/will-donald-j-trump-be-banned,Will Donald J. Trump Be Banned?,When it was announced that Donald Trump could be banned from holding public office again many questioned whether he ever held public office before. The White House gig? That was babysitting The Resolute known as the president’s desk. He was also known for tweeting.He proved to be a racist and a bigot and pro-Nazi but those qualities were nothing to write home about. Trump would have spelled it to r-i-g-h-t home about. Trump was also a bad speller.But he ate well. Or e-i-g-h-t well. Loved the chocolate cake hamburgers and French fries. Didn’t like reading writing or arithmetic unless he was counting up emolument gains.Other than that Trump could perform the same job as a bartender motel manager but not a dog catcher. A maligned group failures in life are often described in terms of “He couldn’t even get a job as a dog catcher.”But sometimes that prophecy is accurate as it is in the case of Donald Trump.If convicted a second vote will be taken in the Senate to ban Donald Trump from ever holding any future public office. Presumably that will even include becoming a dog catcher.While the Democrats have 50 votes 17 more Republican votes will be required. Fifty more from Republicans making it unanimous would be a direct stairway to paradise and safety for all dogs.“Nah! No way! Trump would not have caught any of us. And Trump would not have spelled way w-e-i-g-h.”So stay tuned to the end of the Senate conviction trial. If the Democrats fail to muster up the 17 more votes required Destry will ride again; side saddle or buggy.Read more by this author:

Knowing better he insisted COVID-19 would be gone in a couple of months; that COVID-19 was like the flu. It would go away with hot weather.Was it incompetence or ignorance? To be or not to be?It seems like people in the White House also took a leap and decided that only the blue states would be affected by COVID-19 and blue states were mostly Democratic. Therefore COVID-19 would be given a so-what attitude.War crimes come to mind because killing people is a 'no-no'! Letting people die is also a no-no. Ignoring a pandemic in the hopes of winning an election is another kind of no-no.Attempting to reverse a free election by claiming it was rigged is also criminal. People can get impeached or go to the slammer.Trump told his mob the election was rigged. That the election was stolen that his mob had to fight to take the country back and reverse the rigged election. So his mob marched to the Capitol to take the country back and reverse Trump’s election.No surprise a riot followed six people were killed numerous injured the building desecrated “Hang Mike Pence” was chanted a scaffolding erected a noose attached.Claiming rigged election for an election loss is the battle cry of a sore loser. It’s like blaming bone spurs for lack of service.What is worse claiming a rigged election or ignoring COVID-19?The number of the dead makes COVID-19 the greater crime.Read more by this author:
Thursday 28 January 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/world/152182/mans-cultural-experiences-make-his-blood-boil,Man's Cultural Experiences Make His Blood Boil,A man who says he is suffering from stress boredom depression frustration isolation gross mental strain and a mild psychopathic nature has admitted that from time to time he gets a bit angry.And often he becomes extremely irritable.Moys Kenwood 57 has been living in southeast Asia for more than eleven years and in that time has had to make significant changes to his way of thinking and behavior after having been bombarded with religion strange beliefs even stranger superstitions and to cap it all sorcery.There's also a widespread tendency to 'bend the truth' or failing that to lie outright.Much of this has made his blood boil.He said:"Yes it's been a learning experience I often think I could have done without. I'm not at all a religious person but cannot escape it here and am constantly reminded of it day and night. It makes my blood boil!"It's a similar story with the other 'issues' especially the sorcery:"Hmm" he said thoughtfully "every culture has its own belief system but trying to make oneself accept that there are ghosts everywhere dead ancestors lurking around the place and spirits to be accommodated in your own household who need to be placated by supplying them with a bowl of dry rice a couple of cigarettes and a small bottle of Fanta takes a rather large stretch of the imagination."He raised his eyebrows and went on:"And if a member of the family becomes sick in any way rather than visit a medical facility with trained staff who can diagnose the problem a trip instead to the family soothsayer is undertaken along with more gifts of rice cigarettes fizzy drinks and of course money to consult the spirits of those dead ancestors to see if they can be of assistance."Those dead ancestors are usually busy however.In lieu of the dead helpers candles are lit palm fronds are waved mantras are chanted and a wide-eyed 'high priestess' dressed in rags attempts to blow the illness away with big noisy puffs of air.I can't believe I'm telling you this but it's true.Blood boils at approximately the same temperature as water.

ENRN quickly shot past $150 with many fans expecting it to reach new highs as the short squeeze continues.“The sudden sharp surge in Enron’s share price and valuation likely has been fueled by a short squeeze given the high short interest” Jersey analyst Joseph Mannman said in a note on Monday. “We believe the current share price and valuation levels are not sustainable and we expect the shares to return to a more normal/fair valuation driven by the fundamentals.”ENRN has been a popular short target on Wall Street with more than 138% of its float shares having been borrowed and sold short. But an army of investors who can quickly jump into the stock market with apps like Robinhood has been on a ENRN-buying spree for months with social networks like Twitter and Reddit fueling the action.

It will be a world-beating referendum like Brexit was and we all know how well that one went don't we?'

Nevertheless it was deemed symbolically important to chalk up another symbolic victory over Trump and also to show everyone that Joe is anything but sleepy. In a surprise endorsement the Chinese communist party said it welcomed Kerry’s initiative and offered unemployed Montana pipefitters free lessons in Mandarin and subsidized airfare to China where jobs in solar manufacturing plants are plentiful unlike in the US where solar-related jobs have actually declined in recent years. The Chinese press release however took pains to remind pipefitters than there was no national $15 an hour minimum wage in China but $.15 an hour was still available.Despite taking incoming flak that missed his personal widebody aircraft by miles--being launched with surplus WWII armaments by hapless Proud Boys and their ilk--Kerry was undaunted.“Taking potshots at the “57 varieties” of pollutants emitted by my family jet may make conservatives feel better but I am the only one offering concrete suggestions to these deplorables—sorry to men in these deplorable circumstances--who have made poor choices not only in their chosen careers but in their electoral selections as well. ""A wise man once said that elections have consequences" Kerry continued. "These pipe guys need to get over it. Remember what President Biden said during the campaign. If you can mine coal you can write computer code. And while Joe himself doesn’t mine or write code he is president and he hails from a family with a long and deep tradition of coal-mining used-car salesmen.""So you folks need to listen now to a man like me who had the foresight to marry a catsup heiress: solar panels are the next big thing after the last big thing whatever that was. If you can’t fit pipe learn to build solar panels. How hard can it be to make little glass thingamajigs with a few wires hanging off the back of a doohickey. C’mon man!"

One is the one he signed prohibiting members of the LGBTQ community from owning pets.And the other one is the PEO that DJT signed stating that any white extremist organization such as the Army of Trump Anarchists will not have to pay any federal taxes whatsoever.When CNNs Jim Acosta asked how many more presidential executive orders President Biden planned on signing Jen whispered “As of now 914.”

But if you ever wished you were a fly on the wall here’s your chance:This past Tuesday President Biden was awakened from his Deep State sleep by the ringing of his ACME RED XXX TOP SECRET PHONE. This phone provides a direct connection between the White House and the Kremlin. During the Cold War it was first used in 1961 by Premier Nikita Khrushchev of the Soviet Union to ask President John F. Kennedy if he would set him up a rendezvous with Marilyn Monroe in exchange for not nuking Washington.Although there were other calls between the leaders of the two powers it has been reported that the phone was last used during the Clinton Administration when President Clinton gave access to the phone to Monica Lewinsky so that they might have privacy while engaging in phone sex chatter.THE OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT OF THE CALL:“Vladimir is that you Dude? What’s up?”“Yo Donald. Your voice sounds different. You got the virus?”“Vlads it’s me Sleepy Joe.”“WTF! The Trumpster just told me he won the election.”“Nah. I won it fair and square.”“Yo Dude. Keep telling yourself that. Eventually someone will believe you.”“Hey Vlads. Any chance you can introduce Hunter to some of your Russian oligarchs? I can make it worth your while. Maybe send you over a saddle so you don’t have to ride bareback.”“How about dumping a plane load of cash on my tarmac like you and Barry did with Iran.”“Yo Vlads. What should I tell the press we talked about?”“Just tell them we talked about Peter Doocy the young kid with FOX NEWS.”Dr. Slim: “I thought that the call was supposed to be confidential.”Dirty: “Yo Dr. Dude. It was. It was between two cons.”

Spotted at the Biden Inauguration last week it appeared that Bill Clinton was unable to keep his nose in his mask.Countless pictures of the former president were taken at the ceremony showing him greeting people elbow-bumping and generally being seen. In all of them his nose appears above the top of his facemask. Clinton however denies that there was any meaning or intention behind this.“When you have a nose like mine it just has to be out there” assured Clinton. “You can’t keep it hidden. It has to be free. It’s like it has a mind of its own. I assure you that my inability to keep it in my mask brings absolutely no metaphors to my mind.”

He said that 17 of the 18 tests came out negative but one showed that she may have Vagatintafucitis.Ivanka asked her doctor what the hell that was. He told her that VagaVaga is a disease that was first discovered in Mobile Alabama back in the early 60s.It is an STD and can be caught in one of two ways either from sitting on a damp toilet seat or by having what is referred to as Numerical Oralsucawacus or that number between 68 and 70.Ivanka was so shocked that she fainted in front of the suppository aisle.She was given mouth-to-mouth by a fellow customer who swore she knew CPR IOU and IUD.Ivanka was driven home by the Walgreen’s custodian since everyone else in the store was busy.Four days later the Walgreen’s pharmacist called her and said that she was fine and that her reading had somehow gotten mixed up with that of a local female streetwalker named Ivonda Trampi.

It's okay because if you have your very own gold toilet time doesn't matter!At 9:00 on election night Donald Trump was on his way to a second four-year term in the White House. So he went to bed.But clocks don’t go to sleep. Clocks keep ticking. Even though Donald went to bed. Time moved on. The world keeps going around.It isn’t as though the world slows down and parks on the side of space somewhere and goes to sleep—no Donald!No. Votes continued coming in continued to be counted mailed-in ballots opened sorted counted for both sides and the tally can and often does change.Because of COVID-19 - that Trump said would disappear in March (but didn’t) - people decided to mail in their ballots instead of risking the possibility of standing in line on election day and catching a case of COVID-19 that Trump said (remember?) was supposed to disappear by March.Mail-in ballots take a little longer to process. Envelopes had to be opened; ballots unfolded votes read and listed. The process isn’t as fast as changing channels from PBS to Playboy.It takes time. And by 2 in the morning Donald Trump and his gold toilet were not destined for another four years in the White House.It’s like when you’re in the second grade. Second-graders sitting in the front of the class will have their vote counted before children sitting in the back of the room. No conspiracy. No stolen election. It’s just the sitting arrangement.No need to start a revolution to storm the Capitol hang the Vice President. It wasn’t 9/11 Pearl Harbor Fort Sumter or the War of 1812.By the end of the week after all the votes were counted Donald Trump lost and Joe Biden won.Second-graders understand this and so should Donald Trump!Eventually.Read more by this author:

Computers have advanced to the point where movies can be further modified to mask up all the actors.“Therefore I dictate that all television and and computer screens shall never again show people without their masks being worn.“This will encourage all to comply and mask up.“Furthermore all animals will be masked in all images as well since it is known that they have tested positive in the past.“And since papayas and tomatoes have also tested positive all fruit and vegetables will be shown as masked.“I realize it may then be difficult to determine who is who in movies. Never fear! The computer generated masks will have the persons name displayed using the same computer generated image software.“Only my face will be shown unmasked. Because my dictatorship is now unmasked.“In addition all actors and actresses must have hypodermic needles hanging from both arms at all times. These must be added by CGI."Bow down slaves!”

I'm in a poor run of form I'm distracted uninterested and limp. I'm making the effort but when you're in a relegation dogfight nothing seems to go your way."Bruce's helper has indicated that although he may be able to help his boss to greater success between the sheets there's nothing he can do for the team on the pitch.They're as good as buggered" he said.

Let's spend it on pointless bureaucracy instead",Britain - but not Northern Ireland - left the EU at the end of 2020 and importing and exporting has not been the same since.Geoff Turnip is an importer/exporter from Bishop's Prepuce who exports beef and imports strudel. "Bringing in the strudel hasn't been a problem because the UK won't introduce any customs checks until May. The underground strudel pipe we built in 2008 is working well but we will need to hire more staff later in the year."For Turnip the real problem at the moment is in exporting. He exports animal produce so he needs to obtain a vet's certificate for every batch he exports. "It's going to cost us an arm and a leg in vet's fees as well as other parts that only the Europeans eat" said Turnip.The problem is not just on the UK side. Exporters in the EU also have to pay UK taxes if they send goods to the UK. Jean-Claude von Cliche is a cheese merchant from La Rochelle. He is no longer delivering his high quality luxury cheese to UK customers because of the extra costs.Cliche explained "We use only ze finest meelks known to man from ze breasts of poor Frenchwomen. Eet ees ze best cheese in ze world. But even zose greedy British will not pay ze extra costs to import it after Brexit. Stupid roastbeefs!"In total the extra paperwork required to manage the new Brexit rules is estimated to cost a total of £7 billion coincidentally almost the same amount that the UK used to pay for full EU membership.Nigel Farage was asked about the Brexit problems. "Yes I suppose it is a bit ironic" he didn't say.

This week computer manufacturer BigHard has developed the world's first non-binary computer.The computer is called Bernard but prefers to use the pronoun "it". It was developed by scientists in San Francisco who wanted to challenge traditional concepts of computing."Most computers use binary language that is 0s and 1s" said inventor Geoff Joystick. "But computer engineers often consider 0s to be male and 1s female because a 0 looks like a testicle and a 1 looks like what an engineer imagines a vagina looks like.""But computing language is really a spectrum. So we have developed a computer that uses a range of numbers from 1 to 3 million."The outcome of this extra set of numbers is that any computation made by the machine is bitchy and outspoken. The computer is also very insecure and doesn't have many practical uses but it looks fabulous.Many engineers have complained about the device. "I'd like to know if the machine was born as a 0-based binary system or a 1-based binary system" said critic Lionel Blair. "It must be one or the other. There's no such thing as a non-binary computer. They've been cross-wiring it but it must have a male to female socket in there somewhere."

In fact he was more than a very bad man he was a very very VERY VERY VERY bad man and one that had to be watched. His name was Donald Trump.Donald had lots and lots of money. He had SO much money that he could buy anything he wanted - even people. Donald bought a lot of people. Then he could do what he wanted with them. He liked to do what he wanted. He liked it very much!Donald liked to buy things. As well as people he liked to buy land and big buildings. Very big. Very bigly.He used his money to make some big buildings and then he let people live in those buildings and they had to give him money - a lot of money!When he got the money he used it to buy more buildings and people and he became very very rich. He became as rich as a king!Donald was very happy.One day Donald had an idea. He said to himself:"I'm happy and I'm rich but I want everyone in the whole wide world to listen to me and do what I say."So Donald used some more of his money to buy some more people and then he used those people to get him a new job. In his new job everyone listened to Donald and they all had to do what he said. Now he was very happy!But then the wheels started to fall off.Many people wanted to help Donald do his job but he didn't want to listen. He told them:"I am Donald Trump. I don't need to listen to you. I know everything!"He didn't listen. He did everything his own way and what a way it was!Donald started to make a lot of mistakes. He made really silly mistakes and said really silly things. He did really silly things as well. Everyone said:"He's a really Silly Billy!"He made a lot of people angry. They were very angry but Donald just smiled. He didn't care - he was the boss. He could do and say what he liked!So he did.Some people started to hate Donald. They said he was doing everything wrong and that he was bad and nasty and as corrupt as fuck and they wanted him to go far far away.But Donald didn't go away. He liked his job and he liked telling everyone what to do. He was a real asshole.Not everyone hated Donald. Some people liked him and they liked the things he said and they liked the things he did. They were morons.There were also people who were not morons however and there were more of the 'not morons' than there were of the 'morons'. The 'not morons' decided that Donald had to stop doing his job and so he had to go and play golf instead.He was sad that he had to stop doing his job but happy that he could play golf even though he was awful at it.Just like he was at everything else.

I would be doing something and something else would happen to disturb me and I'd fire off a volley of verbal filth."Those around Kenwood said his language could regularly be "quite colorful" and a bit "fruity".Kenwood confirmed this. He said:"Yes I suppose it was! Especially when those fucking bells started chiming at the nearby temple at 5 o'fucking clock in the morning! On and on and on and fucking on. Yes that really got my fucking goat that did! Cunts!"He was philosophical about using such filthy language. He said:"I think it was due to all the intense pressure I was under at the time. I was using those rude words to express my anger and frustration with the situation I was in. I call it my 'Expressionist period'!"Now that he's back at work however and some sort of normality has returned to his life the habit has disappeared. He said:"I'm over the fucking worst of it. I hardly ever fucking swear now."

Deciding to make some cash on the side she is opening a boutique called Melania's Leftovers.Her famous green jacket with I Don't Care Do You? written on the back should fetch a small fortune if anyone cares that much.However Donald thinks the Boutique idea is tacky no class and smacks of the poorhouse Slovenian clean out the basement garage sale before the divorce. However he has contributed miles and miles of red ties.Melania insisted on a 10% kickback for every tie sold but Donald reneged.“They’re my ties. Why should you get back a percentage?”“Then open your own boutique.”Donald knew he was stuck between a rock and a Slovenian place. He didn’t want to open his own boutique but he had enough ties to wrap around Mar-a-Lago twice.Ivanka to the rescue! She offered to sell Daddy’s ties on her website. Donald Jr. intervened asking Why should Ivanka sell dad's old ties make some cash on the side and I get skipped over like always?

Five minutes in he raised his hand for permission to leave the room and scurried out once this had been given.After returning to the class he gingerly sat down but didn't look comfortable and it was no surprise when his hand went up again five minutes later. Again he was allowed to go out.When however he repeated his request with two minutes of the lesson remaining Teacher Moys asked him to wait for the bell which was "about to" ring.In truth what was "about to" happen was something entirely different.As Kenwood turned towards the blackboard something akin to curtains ripping could be heard followed by a bubbling then the sound of a pail of water being emptied onto a concrete floor.Kenwood said:"I expected the worst and I expected right. The boy was stood in a lumpy brown sea and the tide was going out. The smell was already horrendous."The classroom was evacuated and left to the cleaners who it's hoped are of the opinion that it's better to have some work rather than no work at all.

Sensitive ex-patients have been observed screaming "Snorers ROB us of our sleep after operations and not everybody can afford luxury single-bed rooms!"German health authorities are sending scientists in to research the problem and have discovered that poorer patients end up feeling much worse after spending time in a multi-bed ward because it is impossible to get quality sleeping time.They have come up with several suggestions to defeat the problem and here are just a few:A) Night nurses are expected to sit on the edge of snoring patients beds and slap them on the head every time they dare to snort!B) A 15000 Euro fine will be imposed on snoring patients for disturbing the peace!C) Repetitive snoring patients will be ejected out of the wards and expelled to the cellar without food and drink for a day!D) Innocent non-snorers will be issued headphones with Richard Wagner classical music piped into their heads which is enough to send anybody to sleep!E) Smoker snorers dipping outside for a quick ciggy will not be allowed back into their wards and will have to spend the night in the open! Scientists hope this will have a double effect; make smokers kick their disgusting habits so they can start breathing through healthy lungs and nostrils!F) Repeat offending snorers will be forced to spend the night awake in a ward full of snorers to get a taste of their own medicine!The Snoring Fraternity are totally against any form of restrictive practices to thwart their favourite hobby disturbing the peace and will arrange a contra protest march lying in their hospital beds starting the 'FREEDOM TO SNORE MOVEMENT IN PUBLIC PLACES' including hospital wards and if non-snorers don't like it they should pay extra fees for a single-bed-ward!The EU is making a final decision to make snoring in hospitals illegal. The UK now out of the EU has washed its hands of any stupid legislation re snoring because in UK hospitals they are used to people farting snoring and hurling abuse at each other during their stays in NHS run hospices!More as we ZZZZZZZZZZ it!

Monday 1 February 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152211/out-of-state-man-disturbed-by-local-old-coot,Out of State Man Disturbed by Local Old Coot,A non-local man is reported to be "highly disturbed" by a chance encounter with a local old coot. According to local authorities a man new to the area made the bad decision to engage an old coot known to locals as "That Crazy Old Coot" in casual conversation. The man briefly shared a bench with the Old Coot in a local park Sunday and was left "shocked and appalled" by the vulgar visuals and crude allegories describing a local politician.In a police report filed immediately after the encounter the non-local man accused the Old Coot of being a public nuisance in loudly proclaiming the local city councilman to be "an alien larva emerging from the pulsating egg of local corruption wasting no time attaching himself to the face of legitimate politics and incubating himself in the viscera of the political body bursting forth from the body cavity amid a spray of criticism the acid of liberal politics coursing through his veins.""I just asked him how his goddamned day was going! I didn't need to be verbally assaulted with that grotesque visual imagery of local politics. What the hell? There were children playing in that park!" The non-local man became even more agitated when informed that no actual laws were broken accused the entire police department of corruption and left. Local reporters soon arrived.The local police chief held a press conference and characterized the Crazy Coot as annoying but essentially harmless. "That Old Coot has been a part of our community since...I can't remember when. Hell I think my dad was police chief when he was just known as 'Crazy Ted'. And apparently he was just as obnoxious" he told reporters investigating the complaint. He went on to explain that everyone who grew up in the local community knew never to engage that Coot in any conversation whatsoever. "This non-local man is new to the area and apparently unaware of our local norms" the police chief explained.It is widely known locally never to make direct eye contact with That Old Coot. One local recalls an accidental encounter with the Old Coot volunteering unsolicited mechanical advice and describing the sound of his starter. "It's the same strategically flawed failure despite superior technology hiding behind a false mask of accomplishment to conceal the truly ugly face of the gross inefficiencies vulnerable to common mud-caked chaos" That Coot allegedly said."I had my kids in the car" explained the irate man. "They didn't need to hear that! That Old Coot is out of his corn-cracking mind just like Jimmy!" the local man dragged up local dirt.That Old Coot is known locally as a teller of tall tales never to be taken seriously. Numerous stories from when the Old Coot "was in the jungle" led to local assumptions that The Coot fought in Vietnam. However over the years it was determined Coot was just in the Peace Corps. But that did not deter the Old Coot from continuing to spin disturbing yarns of spectacular nonsense within a context of utter bullshit. "Nobody knew that much about him because nobody listened to that Crazy Old Coot anyway. If he ever said anything that made sense it was an accident" said a different local.That Old Coot's feckless feats are too numerous to count even if anyone wanted to. But one incident stands out as locally legendary. The Crazy Old Coot once overtly expressed his dislike of a local restaurant...while still in the restaurant. "The last time I ate here I crapped out something that climbed a tree!" he expressed loudly almost clearing out the place before ordering the Bottomless Gumbo Bowl. Afterwards he allegedly visited the restroom and took a huge dump cackling as he departed "Better latch that restroom door!""WTF? That's the last thing somebody with a plate full of crabs wants to hear. And who does that and not even tip?" recalled the local manager incredulously. "I hate that guy! I wish he'd move."

How cool is that? Let's spread some crazy shit about Biden's dick looking like some pathetic vegetable maybe a baby corn. We could then link him to some second rate hooker from Philly who went South on him a few times. I know a few who'll do anything for a donation."The planning session then broke into a 30-minute brainstorm where attendees were asked to name fruits and vegetables that would make Biden seem more boring and diminutive than Trump and then rate each suggestion. The eventual winning idea remained a baby corn while a wilted celery stick came a close second and a kiwi a distant third.CNN anchor Chris Cuomo scoffed after reading the report exclaiming "that's pathetic. I bet Biden's wang is more like a butternut squash."When asked White House press secretary Jen Psaki would neither confirm nor deny the report stating she had "yet to see the President's schlong."
Monday 1 February 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152225/cuomo-and-newsom-can-twirl-but-can-they-hop,Cuomo and Newsom can twirl; but can they hop?,Analysts say the two foremost governors in charge of martializing the society at the cost of businesses dying suicides and other abuses appear to be shifting their positions now that Trump is gone.Mr. Cuomo of New York and Mr. Newsom of California have both indicated some easing of restrictions although why exactly is as usual not clear according to experts pondering the situation.Indeed Mr. Newsom's office recently indicated that the reasoning behind Mr. Newsom's profuse covid program was far too complex to try to explain due to being derived from computer algorithms.These highly technical brains in the place of human intelligence (or lack of it) have conjured the following solution:A very dangerous color in California is purple because this means a particular county is limited in certain ways now familiar in terms of "the lockdown ballet."Take an average sized county in Northern California (and this could apply to many counties throughout the country) at 100000 and about one hundred square miles. Its record during the panic has been 37 deaths total since last March. One person only is in intensive care. Less than 400 cases.Also as is well known the deaths are mostly (LA Times says 74%) elderly with additional problems.One consequence of Mr. Newsom's policies is the gathering momentum of a petition to recall him.Cold weather and patio dining might seem to offer a competitor for covid medical experts say . Breakfast at 39 degrees F (besides traffic noise and exhaust) would not to some seem a reasonable exchange for the danger.Additionally now that the WHO has announced a problem of "false positives" the problem once again appears to have been over-stated toward hysterical conclusions that also happen to benefit wealthy corporations.Analysts conclude Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Newsom may well be ready to hop on opening up the economy again before voters turn to them with the message "to hop it and move on back to your day job."
Tuesday 2 February 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152245/biden-to-ban-pygmy-dwarf-tossing,Biden To Ban Pygmy-Dwarf Tossing,BILLINGSGATE POST: With his forty-first executive order President Biden banned the use of Pygmy-dwarfs in any games which utilize little people under four feet tall in a game similar to dart throwing - except instead of using darts the contestants use dwarfs wrapped in Velcro and toss them at the target.Dwarf-tossing originated in Australia as a pub promotion and spread to America in the late 1980s. People with dwarfism wearing special padded clothing or Velcro costumes are thrown onto mattresses or at Velcro-covered targets. Contestants compete to throw the dwarf the farthest. In 1989 Florida enacted a ban on dwarf-tossing at establishments where liquor was served and New York followed with a similar ban.Being a small-minded man this is a very personal issue with Sleepy Joe. Tracing himself back to Lilliput Island a fictional island that appears in the 1726 novel Gulliver’s Travels by Jonathan Swift he identifies with small men.As depicted by Swift Lilliputians are men six inches in height but possessing all the pretension and self-importance of full-sized men. They are mean and nasty vicious morally corrupt hypocritical and deceitful jealous and envious and filled with greed and ingratitude. Today they would simply be called Democrats.Dr. Slim: “Evolutionarily speaking Biden is a full-sized man with a Lilliputian brain.”Dirty: “Yo Dr. Dude. It’s like he trying to be the life of the party in a Coma Ward.”

It's not Rocket Science!"Teacher Moys Kenwood had been wading through the unrelentingly boring subject of 'The Three States Of Matter' but one of his students persistently interrupted the lesson by asking about types of space transport NASA past Apollo missions and 'what the future would bring'.Kenwood knew exactly what the future was going to bring. He said:"I told the student to stay on the topic we were learning about rather than keep going off at a tangent or I'd have to punish him severely."The student however had other ideas. He asked Kenwood about the famous 1969 Apollo 11 Moon landing and details about the different types of craft used during other space explorations. He also wanted to talk about the likelihood of a manned trip to Mars in the near future and the type of rocket needed for such a mission.Kenwood had just about had enough of this troublesome youth and delivered his now-famous line.When questioned about the incident the student said:"I already know about that 'Three States of Matter' crap. I thought it would be more interesting to talk about space travel but obviously this teacher is in training for some sort of Tedium Award."Kenwood refused to confirm that he was in training for a Tedium Award.

He said:"Well you don't do you? I mean it's none of my business really is it? Just bite your lip and say nothing that's my angle!"But this morning that all changed.Kenwood finally decided to speak out about his environmental concerns:"Yes there's definitely something amiss. The foliage on the trees is certainly not as green as it should be and not as green as it has been in previous years."He went on:"Last year for example the leaves were a vibrant green. They were twice as green not like they are now when they are only half as green."And the reason for this 'ungreeness'?"Well I'm not really qualified to say" he said "but I'll wager it's got something to do with the weather."

"Many of us have put away a wee bit of skag to get us through the winter so we thought why no let us all have some?"Approximately half the population of Scotland are regular heroin users already the highest proportion in the world. Delivering the drug to the entire population will be the first time the 50% heroin-use barrier has been broken since the Second Opium War.Morag McTeacake is a retired tartan artist from Auchermuchty. "I've been an occasional user for the last few months" she said. "I used to be happy with a shortbread biscuit so when I discovered the H I was over the moon."McTeacake was first offered the drug at her local needle exchange where she usually replaces her knitting needles every two weeks. Fellow knitter Cumbernauld McIrn-Bru gave her her first sample of the addictive opiate and Morag loved it instantly."When I'm knitting on smack time just flies by" she said. "Last week I knitted a scarf three miles long and every time I dropped a stitch I had an orgasm. We can all do with some o' that."

Fisherman Geoff Flounder was optimistic. "I'm optimistic" he said. "We can save money by consuming all of the fish on the journey back to Grimsby. It's only going to go rotten if we don't eat it."

All had put forth the subversive idea that Trump had actually lost the election.Meanwhile the GOP approved of those who attempted to help the leader organize a coup including Ted Cruz Josh Hawley Louis Gohmert and the well armed truthers Lauren Boebert and Marjorie Taylor-Greene."We can't have people like Cindy McCain in the party any longer as they stand in the way of eliminating the Cancel Culture" said Greene in a recent interview.

Still its storyline of a man repeating the same day day after day after day until it is perfect has some resonance with Lockdown life.Sociologist Basil Numpkins said: 'During Lockdown our days are increasingly similar but unlike Groundhog Day they are not the same. We do not look out of our windows and see the same people at the same time. Other people's lives are changing and developing at the same time as ours is.'Also if you watch Groundhog Day backwards it becomes about a man escaping from Andie McDowell and that is something to be celebrated.

Mike has many years experience in predicting weather patterns based on nothing more than the visibility of his own shadow. Let’s all join me in welcoming Mike back to this annual pagan ritual. And don’t wake me up anymore!” announced Phil from a pre-written statement before ducking back into his hole.There had been concerns that weather patterns in the North do not necessarily reflect the on-set of spring in the South. In reply to such criticism in 1978 the Mystic Order of Groundhogs opened a regional office in southern Louisiana to address regional weather cycles. In 1993 Maringouin Mike joined the Maringouin LA office and served as chief prognosticator for one year before an unfortunate set of circumstances led to his ouster.In the early morning of February 2 1994 as Mike was being dragged from his hole half asleep by a handler he produced a firearm and fired striking his handler in the hand. The handler fully recovered. However Mike was sentenced to 3 years at a Louisiana work farm and 10 years probation during which time he was prohibited from working in the weather field.After his trial Maringouin Mike was forcefully removed from the courtroom during sentencing screaming “I ain’t got any idea how ya’ll Yankees do thangs up thar in Pennyvany but ya go jus pullin’ folks out dere hole down heah and ya gonna get yar ass blown off!”Mike was released after serving 18 months for good behavior and worked abroad until he rejoined the Groundhogs’ regional office in 2017. Speaking from a porch he constructed around his hole last summer Maringouin reassured the crowd that there would be no more such incidents as long as they knock discreetly then step back off the porch.“I’ll come right out heah and tell ya’ll eveythang I know” said Mike spitting tobacco off into the distance. Then gesturing with his thumb towards his hole he added “But don’t go jus stickin’ ya hand in dere!”In a related story meteorologists are predicting another intense cold spell for later this week after yet another unseasonably balmy weekend. When back up groundhog Canandaigua Carl Ph.D was asked if the recent weather pattern supports or disproves the concept of climate change he replied via Twitter “Who knows for sure? Until about 25 years ago we had crappy data."Regarding the remainder of the season Biff Winter could not be reached for comment.

Pruem is a town lodged between green hills faraway in the Eifel area of Germany.Locals have always wondered why such a huge cathedral was built in this rural town and now the answer to their prayers has been discovered! The stench arising from the catacomb always aroused suspicion but nobody in their right mind dared to enter the place just in case ghosts of past German 'misdemeanours' were released and the local sewer pipe runs under the building!However pilgrims visiting the glorious gold-coated Cathedral complained about the stench so the present priest sent a team of 'Ghostbusters' down to find out where the 'Hell' the stench was coming from!An abandoned hand-carved-wooden- foot-locker stood in the corner which had 'lost its religion' many years ago! The Ghostbusters opened the door and 'bob's your uncle' a pair of rat-infested sandals appeared! Luckily the date when they were made was engraved into a rusty buckle! Shock horror! 0020 AD and Made in Jerusalem!Jesus historians rushed to Pruem to confirm the fact that Jesus had actually worn the sandals whilst walking on water and after closer examination tiny particles of fishbones were found Jackpot! Jesus wore them while feeding the 5000 with fish and bread!It seems a Brit Crusader discovered the sandals after slaughtering non-believers in Jerusalem. He stuffed them in his leather pouch and on the way home to the UK stopped off for a quick prayer and glass of holy water in Pruem. By that time the sandals stunk to high hell so he threw them down into the catacomb where later a German choir boy found them after being locked away because he refused to blow-away the priest's candle!The choir boy threw them in the foot-locker (is that plagiarism or blasphemy?) and escaped via the sewer which was an open subterranean stream in those days!Jesus's sandals now stand proudly behind a panzer-glass window for global pilgrims to admire. Israel is demanding they be returned to Jerusalem because they now have proof Jesus only wore sandals because he had sweaty feet which made them stink not fish particles! Israel claim that's fake news invented by him in The Vatican!

It will also withstand quarterback sacks of 94 PSIs.The new technological system mini-computer is called the Apple Pi 101 Gazelle. It was devised in Osaka Japan by a scientist who has the largest collection of autographed NFL football helmets in the world.Hiriki Yamaha 61 is also credited with inventing The Saki 7 Cell Phone that can send text messages to the North Pole Siberia and the Moon even in the most inclement weather.Goodell has fallen in love with Yamaha’s invention and has agreed to implement the Gazelle for the 2021-2022 season.The commissioner added that each Gazelle will cost each team about $1.3 million but he added that each mini-computer will pay for itself by the 5th game of the season - the 9th if you’re the New York Jets.

The dancers will descend the steps of the Capitol legs swinging in sync and then return to the Chamber where Al Green will perform 'Let's Stay Together' with all eyes on Mitch McConnell and Kamala Harris attempting a Paso Doble on the Senate floor which may evolve into a Kentucky Shimmy and when all have retaken their seats Cruz swings back into the Chamber and dumps Pelosi on her seat her blue neckerchief is gone and she now wears Sparrow's sea-dog bandana. Tickertape falls the GOP brings out three cheers for thugs and mobsters Pelosi calls Trump to tell him he can go back to sleep and they all live happily ever after.Republican leader McConnell was confident this was the right thing to do. "Some claim we're not taking this seriously but hell dancing with Kamala is an act of retribution in itself. And I mean that in the nicest possible way. I sure do..."

Not so well-documented is that he shares his daily rations with Champ and Major.The White House chef noting that his boss was losing a step or two both mentally and physically decided that instead of feeding the dogs leftovers from the President’s evening meal he would feed the President leftovers from the dog’s bowl - all for the President’s well-being of course.It seems that the President’s favorite meal is anything with Hamburger Helper a packaged food product that is added to hamburger to create variety. You can have Hamburger Helper Cheeseburger Macaroni Deluxe Beef Stroganoff Chili Macaroni Tomato Basil Penne and several other classic meals - enough to get you through a week without duplicating the menu.Champ the chef says is especially fond of the Stroganoff while Major prefers the Chili Macaroni although this is not good for his pesky hemorrhoids. As far as Joe is concerned whatever the dogs eat is good enough for him.In a related story it has been reported that when Kim Jong-un met with President Obama he couldn’t keep his eyes off the Obamas’ Portuguese Water Dog Bo.Dr. Slim: “I understand that President Obama was offered a McMuttley’s franchise in Pyongyang if he would let Kim take Bo back with him.”Dirty: “Yo Dr. Dude.

He drifted into a wonderland where Sleep was king and where Work was an evil enemy who roamed the wastelands of the mind preying on those too innocent too gullible to stand up for themselves in today's capitalist society and tell their bosses to go and fuck themselves and stick their crummy-paying jobs up their arses.Suddenly he snapped awake. It was 6:20. Like a man possessed and fearful of telling his boss to go and fuck himself and to stick his crummy-paying job up his arse Kenwood showered and dressed in one motion and roused his wife from her slumbers to go and make his dinnertime sandwich whilst he swallowed his breakfast.Those tasks completed the pair roared off on their motorbike and reached Kenwood's school with a minute to spare at 7:29 a.m.Said the 'teacher' to his wife:"Seeing as we were early I might start getting up at 6 instead of 5 in future."

This was then followed by strong sulfur smells noticed by visitors. That resulted today in the eruption at the top crater of the sculpture (Roosevelt) sending tourists and rangers fleeing.The Memorial was completed in 1941 at the top of one of North America’s most active volcanoes. To this point the National Park Service has been lucky. That luck ended as lava came pouring down Lincoln’s beard and Jefferson’s nose. The flow reached the Visitors’ Center and has stranded hikers.“Teddy’s head just exploded today” reported Park Ranger Jeff Henner. “There’s not much of him left. Jefferson’s left side is gone. Washington is still intact. But poor Abe. His head is crumbling before my eyes. First Booth and now this. I just can’t stand to watch.”

In addition she has threatened BOJO; if there is no new Brexit referendum she would dump Scottish rotting lobsters on his doorstep!Boris Johnson was not available for comment but he told his main spin-doctor secretly he prefers Middle American caught in the Pacific lobsters anyway because they do not squeak as much as English ones during boiling!

He said:"I was furious."The comical scene drew bemused looks from passing pedestrians and token street vendors. One woman told her friend:"Oh look! The strong wind has blown that foreigner's face mask off. How mildly funny!"Kenwood scowled at them.A man who was sitting idly astride a parked-up motorbike scrolling absent-mindedly on his phone looked up just as the gust blew the mask off Kenwood's face. He laughed:"Ahahahahaha!" in a somewhat contrived way.Later the breeze dropped and life returned to normal.

She is a member of QAnon the terrorist group claiming that: Satan-worshipping cannibalistic pedophiles are running a global child-trafficking ring and plotting against Donald Trump.QAnon people were part of the group that attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6 tried to overturn the 2020 election killed six people broke down doors shattered windows vandalized offices and stole property.QAnon people love Donald Trump and think he is god. QAnon people also think Tom Hanks is the devil. Go figure.So this QAnon lady packing a gun expressing a desire to shoot and lynch people a member of the House of Representatives from the state of Georgia should be censured.Right?Wrong!Kevin McCarthy the guy in charge of the minority Republican Party in the House is too chicken.

They later discovered that the gene that controls lying and decency was missing.

Trump is innocent.Donald Trump wasn’t firing up a mob. Nah! No way! All Trump said was “Make your thinking known.”Or: “Folks” (referring to a mob of goons and killers defecating in the halls and urinating against the walls of the Capitol Building as FOLKS immediately sanitizes their situation) "Folks express yourselves.”And that they did on the marble floors and against the walls stealing equipment vandalizing offices breaking down doors windows furniture and the most egregious chanting that they wanted to hang Vice President Mike Pence and kill Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and perhaps every other Democrat they could locate.Express yourselves. Make your thinking known.Well yes Trump did say “You’ve got to fight to take your country back.” Hinting that a free election stole the country. He also said “You can’t be weak.” Another innuendo that if you don’t kick ass you’ll be known as a bunch of weak sisters. And lord knows no one wants to be known as a weak sister not even a nun!Trump even promised to march with them to the Capitol Building. However he must have developed an attack of bone spurs because he was a no-show. He watched and cheered on his folks from the safety and comfort of the White House living quarters.There are also rumors that he directed the security forces that could have stopped the violence to stand down.But basically that is the legal defense of his attorneys. Trump is a good guy and innocent.Hopefully before the verdict Trump’s attorneys already received full payment for their legal fees.Read more by this author:

He was mystified as to why the yearly American football extravaganza is still called the Super Bowl.He said:"Yes that's my point. That's what I would like to know. The game has been known as the two-worded Super Bowl since the mid-1960s but it's not known where the original bowl is - that is the one that the game was named after.He clarified:"It is only known that it was 'super'.Other words containing the adjective 'super' such as superstar supernova superman superstore supervisor supersonic supernatural supertanker superstructure and supermarket all became compound words because it made perfect sense to do so but 'Super Bowl' has steadfastly refused to fall into line."Indeed" said Kenwood "calling it the Super Bowl makes absolutely no sense whatsoever."

This is a practice in which the butler of one gentleman is put in a pit with the butler of another gentleman with whom there is a disagreement. What follows is a fight to the death. The honor of the winning butler is upheld and disgrace follows the gentleman whose butler was defeated.“These barbaric events must and will end now“ stated Lamont. “We must move forward to a more advanced time when the good gentlemen of our state settle their differences with pistols swords or boards with a rusty nail sticking out.”In an outraged response GOP state senator Lewis Tweed III blasted the new law. “I have spent decades training the finest staff of warrior-butlers known across Connecticut. This is ridiculous! What’s next? Will I have to feed myself as well?”

It is believed that a curse was placed on the movie by John Whale the director of the original Frankenstein movie on anyone who tried to re-create his movie in a satirical manner.“There is no way that all of these deaths could be a simple coincidence” stated noted Hollywood psychic Terrence Lookman. “You put the pieces together and it becomes obvious that the curse is real.”Teri Garr could not be reached for comment. She is believed to be in hiding.

Studsteen stated that the reason is due to the mosquito infestation that has hit the city and ravaged it beyond belief.Local citizens are comparing it to the problem caused by the Crawfish Attack of 1959 when millions of crawfish invaded the city from the Gulf of Mexico wreaking havoc as they destroyed over a dozen businesses including the infamous Buccaneer Jean Lafitte Whorehouse.The governor and both U.S. senators from Colorado are thrilled to have the residents of Louisiana visit their fabulous state where marijuana can be purchased at literally any fast food restaurant in the state.The governor of Colorado understands that the city of New Orleans had not seen such devastation since the War of 1812 and before that when it was raided and pillaged on Halloween night of 1727 by the notorious pirate scourge Crimsonbeard.The mayor of Denver noted that he had relatives living in New Orleans and they texted him telling him about the dastardly marauding gunk-carrying mosquitoes from Florida's Okefenokee Swamp.These mosquitoes which originally migrated to Florida from Denmark have been known to suck upwards of two gallons of blood from unsuspecting elderly adults and toddlers in a mere 2 minutes.Meanwhile the ABC affiliate in Denver has announced that Mardi Gras visitors from the Big Easy will be allowed to take back to Louisiana up to 1.5 pounds of Durango Bango Marijuana.

Georgia senator Marjorie “Shithead” Taylor Greene a woman who looks like a worn out mop has proved stupidity comes in all shapes forms genders and bitches.Pelosi and the Democrats are insisting that the evil woman with an anorexic-looking ass needs to be arrested for 51 different reasons including viciously attacking a pack of pit bulls saying her gynecologist molested her during her last four monthly visits and for stealing a hook and ladder fire truck and taking it to a pawn shop.Pelosi remarked that Greene who used to work as a tampon tester back in her home town of Crackerhead Georgia has shown in just a few short weeks that she is the spitting image of Donald Trump except that Marjorie has lots of tattoos nauseating cellulite and of course a well-used muffin.Many political pundits have said that she makes KKK grand dragons look like effeminate ballet dancers.Even Melania Trump chimed in and said “My gootness chakes dees beach from shorsha makes my Donaldo seem like a chugar ploom ferry.”Meanwhile Howard Stern said that Greene needs to have her crotch inspected because as ugly as she is there is no damn way in hell she could possibly be a woman."

The nosey and somewhat rather plain Jane reporter asked him where the former president is going.Without thinking as all of the Trumps are prone to do Eric blurted out that his daddy is moving to Scotland.Needless to say Bartiromo was shocked since it’s really no secret that she and Donald have been alleged to have a passionate relationship.Eric tried to correct himself by saying that he meant his dad was going to be going to the Scotland Bagpipe Company which is located in the Bronx.CNN’s Anderson Cooper recently mentioned on his show that Maria and Donald share a fondness for golf lying Big Macs lying John Wayne and lying.A visibly shaken Maria began to cry and told Eric to have his daddy call her ASAP. Eric asked her what ASAP meant.Maria shook her head and walked away muttering in Spanish that Melania was right the boy is definitely missing several crayons out of his Crayola box.

Apparently before his program began recently there was a disclaimer.“That’s kind of an insult” said Giuliani.Not kind of an insult it is most definitely an insult as well as an insurance policy so the television station would not be sued.Like Giuliani's hairdresser should have announced a disclaimer indicating he was not responsible for Giuliani's dripping hair color that ran down the sides of his face neck and settled beneath his shirt collar.Not good for business or attracting new clients.“They could have told me they were going to do that” Giuliani continued to lament.He apparently believed he could get away with rattling off any kind of dreamscape.Like: “Donald Trump wears fishnet stockings under his navy suit and a bra and I won’t mention the thong.”Or: “The election was stolen by Adolf Hitler who designed the voting machines that Osama Bin Laden purchased for the Democrats and the machines bounced every ten votes that went to Donald Trump over to Joe Biden.”Then add in rapid succession: “Everybody knows this.”“Adolf Hitler's voting machines were crooked.”“The election was stolen.”“And Donald Trump is still the real president of the United States and wears a thong.”Those statements could put the incorrect spin on the news. Some people might actually believe the newsflash and encouraged by Donald Trump to storm the Capitol might actually storm the Capitol which they did storm.The news station would be responsible for Giuliani’s misinformation and be liable for all the damages caused after storming the Capitol.So better the disclaimer before Giuliani begins his newscast regardless of the size of the insult.Read more by this author:

He sniffed up hard and gruffly coughing negotiated it into his mouth before launching it out into the fresh countryside air.This was a mistake.No sooner had the snot started to move away from Kenwood's mouth than its progress was halted by the backward flow of air created by the motorcycle's forward momentum.Stopping as it were in mid-air the snotball waited the split-second it took Kenwood's face to arrive at the same place and told him it was nice to see him again.After a short pause during which a handkerchief was used to remove the snot clarted across his cheeks the journey was resumed.Said Kenwood:"I won't make that mistake again in a hurry!"There was much sniggering at the front of the motorbike.

Sunday 7 February 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152314/pelosi-adds-strip-search-now-required-of-all-reps-entering-house-chambers,Pelosi adds strip search now required of all Reps entering House Chambers,Capitol police are not sure they have the personnel to carry out Ms. Pelosi's new orders especially for bathroom breaks from the House floor.The issue rises from a purported metal detector violation by two Republican House members Reps. Louie Gohmert and Andrew Clyde.Representative Gohmert stepped off the House floor for a bathroom break and did not use the detector leading to his $5000 fine for a first offense ($10000 for a second and following).Mr. Gohmert has said that it is not possible to secrete a weapon inside a toilet tank in a House bathroom so the fine in his case is “a non-issue.”Meanwhile GOP leaders accused Ms. Pelosi of avoiding the detectors herself despite saying earlier: “It is tragic that this step is necessary but the Chamber of the People's House must and will be safe.”Whether Ms. Pelosi must now pay a $5000 fine is moot due to the possibility she is exempt from her own rules.Analysts have pointed out avoiding the rules by the rule-makers has been common in recent months indicating that “virtue-signaling” is more important than virtue itself.Further no one so far has suggested Ms. Pelosi may be packing as within the sacrosanct regions of her underwear.However this last possibility has apparently occurred to The Speaker of the House as the next security measure to keep The People's Chamber safe.Henceforth all representatives entering the chamber will be strip-searched by capitol police even those leaving momentarily for a bathroom break.(The search includes bending over and "spreading" as within the prison system.)Those avoiding this procedure will be fined $10000 for the first offense and $20000 henceforward.It is fortunate these representatives can afford the fines with their $175000 annual salaries as base start for their personal economy while serving the public.Ms. Pelosi's worth for example is estimated at approximately 135 million ranked at the 15th wealthiest member of congress.Meanwhile Ms. Pelosi has responded: “I have never packed anything in my life and certainly not in that region of the anatomy.”“As to not walking through the detector I perhaps forgot for a moment engaged as my mind is with the Trump business."“Now as to what next what advance beyond a strip-search as may well be needed that is not clear to me at the moment. But I am working on it!”

However he’s on film with audio (his voice) speaking on January 6 in front of the White House saying "Fight like hell."Guilty as charged. Bingo!But there is more. Unable to face the loss of his reelection he decided his reelection was stolen. That’s like if Tom Brady were to lose the Super Bowl is he justified to claim it was stolen? According to Donald Trump yes.Trump’s logic would be: Tom Brady is the incumbent Super Bowl quarterback year after year after year and should have won the 2021 Super Bowl and because he didn’t win it was stolen.According to the rest of the world viewing the Super Bowl it was a great game one winner not Brady. So should Brady hold a rally in front of his Florida mansion and tell fans to fight for him? Pardon to go "Fight like hell" for him?Just a little bit crazy. But it worked on January 6. Fans listened to Trump marched down to the Capitol Building broke in vandalized threatened murder and they were fighting like hell for him. Just like their leader told them to fight.Double guilty as charged.So the impeachment trial starts Monday February 8 2021 the day after the Super Bowl. While Donald Trump sent his supporters to the Capitol Building to fight like hell for his stolen election he will not testify on his own behalf.What? No fight like hell for his own innocence?Researchers say there are 20 sounds a chicken can make (Google it). By not testifying Trump is making at least one of those sounds.Read more by this author:

Pete Burns.Sadly John Joe dressed in a pair of tight Nureyev tights plus a bulge and a tutu with matching pink skinny top twisted a disc too far! His rare 45 single copy was twisting on the turntable like Chubby checker once did so fast JJ pirouetted out of control! His extra-long false eyelashes zoomed off blurring his eyesight! He then crashed into his favourite antique mirror purchased for 5've-Bob down the Portobello Road and in a slippery frenzy slipped his disc!A London ambulance arrived after his/her mum heard the din upstairs. Originally she thought it was a South-Eastern train crashing past her council flat heading towards London Bridge. But John Joe screaming with agony on the floor managed to raise the alarm and was carted off to hospital by two masked ambulance men.John Joe's mum has now dumped his Jurassic record player and replaced it with an ancient CD player. She feels spinning around to ancient 45 discs in a tiny upstairs bedroom is much too dangerous for her rather wild son wannabe daughter after his/her slip because she'd rather have him/her 'alive than dead.'As for Pete Burns better less said because he was rather a pain in the arse!

We share the biscuit and tea-making responsibilities equally and apart from the Urinal Cake debacle in 2018 we have never had any drama. I wish we could have a meeting that is as exciting as the Handforth one. I didn't join the Parish Council to have a nice time and make some low-level changes to Chutney on the Fritz; I joined it to be rebellious.'Fellow Parish Council Member Diana Brassingthwaite said: 'Of course before COVID-19 and we had parish council meetings in person we would go to the pub afterwards Gary never joined us but I tell you now some of the language that was used about Gary would make a Sailor blush.'

Kennedy High School in Dirty River Wyoming in a few months.Boone told Buckaroo Kazoo with the Turnstile Review that he personally saw young Ballyhoo throw the ball at 107 mph. He added that he can also throw both right- and left-handed plus he can even throw perfect strikes while wearing a blindfold.The 17-year-old phenomenon also has a fantastic knuckleball that is almost impossible to catch. Baseball scouts say that the catcher actually has to take off his catcher’s mitt and use a huge butterfly net in order to catch the fluttering ball.When asked what he attributed his tremendous throwing speed to he said he got his speed from his Grandma Matilda who used to throw 91 mph rocks at wolves that would attack her flock of flamingos.Ballyhoo’s parents Gregg and Ginger are midget trapeze artists who perform for the Ringling Brothers Barnum & Bailey Circus.Boone said that Kyle will be sent down to the Yankees minor league farm club The Duluth Doodlebugs where he will pitch one game before joining the “Bigs” after signing a 2-year contract worth $14 million.

The girls ate hamburgers and fries and Andy had Vichyssoise Smothered in Sauteed Mauritanian Mushrooms with Refried Lobster Newfoundland on the side.Cohen asked the lascivious all-female trio about the rumor that started in Cleveland that Trump had grabbed each one of them by the pubic playpen last summer while they were having Mango Margaritas on his yacht on Lake Erie.Band member Hooha said that one minute he was talking about how pretty his hair was and the next he had her two lower lips in his little bitty sissy fingers.Beaver chimed in saying that when he grabbed her vajayjay she came very close to biting him on his hand but resisted for fear of possibly catching some sort of weird communicable disease.And the third band member Muffin said that when he grabbed her taquito she hauled off and kicked him in his testes causing him to scream out like a female opera singer in his native German.Meanwhile the titillating trio told Cohen that each band member has dozens of nude photos of Trump and they will be making them available to the X-rated version of Wikipedia Sikipedia in a week or so.

Nancy Poozleosi said she couldn’t believe that President Biden would sink that low even though he is a baritone.This same bar was in the news earlier this year. It was reported that Congresswoman Maxine Waters had her neck bitten by her own false teeth while singing a James Brown hit "Papa's Got A Brand New Bag". Maxine explained that she had removed her false teeth and put them on the bar because when she attempted to hit the high notes her teeth kept slipping. One of the other singers - it might have been Nancy Poozleosi - picked up Maxine’s dentures and used them to bite her neck when she missed a high note while singing the song. All in good fun of course.Despite the COVID-19 restrictions Little Miss Whiskey's Golden Dollar has never closed down. The bar is located in the Atlas District near the nation's capital. Described as having "mismatched seating and offbeat accents" (neon signs crystal chandeliers lots of purple) it is not a joint where you would usually find older gentlemen frequenting much less adversaries such as Trump and Biden. But in a place where there is often a "unity vibe" with folks "dancing and singing the night away" anything can happen and often does.Although Trump has said that he doesn’t drink President Biden may have been taken in by "friendly" staffers who offered a "wide variety of whiskeys" and "frozen alcoholic slushies" that are a "guaranteed hangover but so good."NOTE: Slim Everdingle is still recovering from his own hangover having been caught up in the revelry of the evening.Dr. Slim: "It's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it."Dirty: “Yo Dr. Dude. I hope you didn’t make a fool of yourself.”

He’ll be forgotten in a thousand years.”But Planet Earth argued that if Liz Cheney were censured in Russia or North Korea or China maybe but this is the United States land of Freedom Of Speech and Liz Cheney is Dick Cheney’s daughter and this isn’t going to end right. Oh no! Remember what happened to Saddam Hussein? He hid for over a year and Cheney found him in a spider hole. And that was just the start of his problems.“Keep moving. The world can’t stop turning. Liz Cheney will be just fine. The Southern District Court of New York will take care of Donald Trump and the rest of his cronies. Just get the world turning again.”Planet Earth was stubborn and argued that the Republicans acted just like Vladimir Putin trying to shut up Russian dissident Alexei Navalny. The Republicans were an embarrassment. Can’t they see freedom of speech is bigger than Donald Trump? Democracy is bigger than Donald Trump. That the rest of the world is watching this debacle?It’ll be alright. The Republicans want to piss in Trump’s golden toilet. They’ll be taken care of soon enough. Just move along and start turning Planet Earth.With one foot on a skateboard Planet Earth pushed off and started turning again. "Humph we'll see about that!"Read more by this author:
Monday 8 February 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/152326/blame-democrats-for-riots-not-trump,Blame Democrats For Riots Not Trump,The Trump defense is basically: Blame the riots on the Democrats but finish with the theory of free speech.Accusatory and hopeful but no cigar.It’s like the little kid who got caught with his hand in the cookie jar. “You filled the cookie jar. I was only eating cookies for you.”Therefore Trump is innocent of inciting a deadly riot. A supporting footnote to this defense is:"Well the Democrats rioted after George Floyd's death."Psst lawyers Democrats aren’t on trial. Donald Trump is on trial. He told the crowds in front of the White House "You've got to fight like hell..." adding "You can't be weak..." also "Take your country back..."Those are fighting words and the same words Trump used to denigrate all of his opponents Americans taxpayers just each time with a different target.However Trump's message wasn't the same as kneeling on someone’s neck for eight minutes until that person is dead.Trump's crowd reacted to his words with cheers applause and action. On January 6 they marched and stormed the Capitol Building where six people were killed terrorized numerous others who feared for their life and vandalized the building.It’s as though Trump had been looking for that fight ever since he came down the escalator. He finally got it.Lawyers don’t blame the Democrats. That is a weak sister defense.Read more by this author:

In addition wearing masks will aid innocent commuters stuck in trains buses and the underground from suffering too much from farting men and women giving the German public a sense of freedom back lost last year when lockdowns began.Signs have been set up all over the nation reading; FARTING HERE IS NOW LEGAL! The reaction of reactionaries has been incredibly positive as they are now allowed to fart all over the place without having to hold their combustible rear-ends until they reach a public convenience to let rip!Scientists have also proven farting reduces angst stress and aggression and as long as masks are obligatory the stench is quite bearable apart from if heavy vegan consumers of sauerkraut or cabbage happen to enter a train carriage or crowded bus!Farting in public places will remain legal until wearing masks is no longer necessary. However a growing number of students studying Henry the Eighth's debauched parties are preparing protest marches all over Germany demanding that farting remains legal in public! They are organising a massive 'Stink-In' in Berlin offering tons of sauerkraut free to enhance their 'FFF / Freedom For Farters' movement after Covid-19 masks have been buried with impunity! Scheiss Dinge!
Monday 8 February 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/152320/how-to-cope-with-americas-coming-drought,How to Cope With America's Coming Drought,Conservation Nuts Inc. Waterloo Iowa. Special to The Spoof.In the midst of massive storms throughout much of the country talking about drought may be a bit out of place. But snowstorms to the contrary climate warming presents a potential water shortage in nearly all of the United States. We can't rely on government to solve this problem because government-sponsored projects will produce more pork than water. Furthermore they do almost nothing immediately to conserve that vital resource. The immediate solution is to curtail water usage in ways no one has yet suggested. Here are six possibilities:1. FEWER NOT SHORTER SHOWERS. Octogenarians can still remember when the Saturday night bath was all that was needed to be clean and presentable. Now the standard is a daily shower. That's a flagrant misuse of our limited water supply. Even shorter showers urged by conservationists still waste water. Suggestion: Apply to shower frequency the odd/even system Los Angeles has used for lawn watering.Residences with odd-numbered addresses will shower on the first and third Saturdays each month while even-numbered addresses shower on the second and fourth. Not only will that save water but it will be a boon to the economy. Deodorant companies will make windfall profits as they develop new aromas. Face masks will be in greater demand prompting up-scale designer fashions. Sociologists and cultural anthropologists will mine the data relating shower frequency to divorce. Another benefit may be that you know friends or relatives are near before you see them.2. KEEP A BUCKET IN THE SHOWER. Unless you have great insulation around your pipes or your water heater is close to the bathroom the first two gallons that come from the shower head are too cold to stand in. Instead of sending that water down the drain direct it into a bucket that you keep in the shower. Dump that water into a planter bed. If you have one of the early low-flush toilets that sometimes require a double flush to do what one flush should have done use the bucket water to assist the flushing process.3. ALTER YOUR TOOTHBRUSHING ROUTINE. The government has urged us to turn off the tap while brushing teeth. Better yet use no water while brushing. Or give up brushing completely and limit dental hygiene to flossing the rubber tip on the toothbrush or those new-fangled little brushes dentists are giving away that slide between the teeth. The amount of water saved may not fill a reservoir but it will make you feel that you have done your bit.4. ELIMINATE INDOOR PLANTS. Like changing your toothbrushing routine this isn't likely to save much water but it will make you feel better about watering your roses and azaleas. You gave up a gloxinia and saved a rose. The greatest benefit however comes from knowing that you would have killed the plant anyway through neglect but you can feel that you got rid of it for a more legitimate reason.5. THE BACKYARD ICE RINK. Forget the native plants as lawn substitutes because they still take some water. Ignore those pool companies that claim a pool takes less water than an equal area of lawn. Instead consider an ice rink. Two inches of water - about as much as you pour on the grass in a two-week period - will be enough to create a frozen pond that will provide enjoyment all year. You may have the next Michelle Kwan. And solar panel telemarketers will have a new sales pitch about how they can provide the power to freeze the water.6. DON'T FLUSH FOR EVERYTHING. It's difficult to remain tactful while discussing this subject but let's try. It was the government official who mentioned this conservation approach so it must be all right to discuss it. Most of us will distinguish between what must be flushed and what can sit a while. Some zealots however will wait too long creating a bit of discomfort within the family. Others will be chided for too frequent flushing. We would suggest the installation of a urinal except for the sneers that it would bring forth. So follow this rule: "If it's yellow let it mellow. If it's brown flush it down."Now if we do all of this don't expect the water experts to cheer. Instead it will only encourage continued sprawl - both out and upward - and a decade from now we will be as bad off as we are now.

Baconmiddle with the TBPD who admitted to betting $4000 on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers stated that most of the 900 arrests were due to parking lot tailgaters not wearing medical masks shoes or pants.One genius beer-bellied fan told police officers that the only way he could eat six hot dogs and drink six beers without taking off his mask was to insert them anally.The officer arrested him and told him that he was going to charge him for not wearing a mask but for also being one dumbass perverted dipshit.Two very attractive buxom Kansas City Chiefs fans who drove to Florida from Joplin Missouri were arrested for taking off their bikini tops and molesting each other’s tatas next to the nachos pavilion.And a die-hard extremely overweight 93-year-old New York Jets fan was taken into custody for flashing her wrinkled-as-hell vagina at two nuns who had merely pointed out that her gigantic panties were sitting on her ankles.The game turned into a blow-out as the Bucs clobbered the Chiefs 31-9. The Chiefs coach stated that his team lost because of huge amounts of Tangerine pollen that was floating all over Raymond James Stadium.

Tuesday 9 February 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/149603/history-for-children-2-adolf-hitler,History For Children #2: Adolf Hitler,Once upon a time there was a little boy called Adolf who lived in a cold snowy country called Austria. From a humble beginning Adolf grew up to be a famous man who everybody knew about. This is his story.Adolf lived in a town called Linz. He hated school. The other students listened to the teacher and did what the teacher told them to do but Adolf folded his arms put his bottom lip out and planned something sinister for the teacher in the future.Adolf also hated some of the other children in his class. One that he hated was called Ludwig Wittgenstein. Ludwig liked to think a lot.One day Adolf's teacher was asking the students about what they would like to do when they left school and went to work. Some said doctors some said soldiers some said nurses some said hairdressers one said a policeman. Adolf said he wanted to be a painter or failing that a 'tyrannical despot'.The teacher looked at him for a long time.When it was time to leave school Adolf left school left home and left Linz. He went to a big city called Vienna. It meant nothing to Midge Ure. In Vienna Adolf became a down-and-out and unhappy about everything.Also he was a terrible painter.He decided to become a despot.In those days there were no colleges or universities that held courses in despotism so he had to teach himself. He went to Germany to get some tips.Whilst he was in Germany a big war broke out and Adolf became a soldier. After it had finished he was angry and frustrated. He was angry with the Jewish people.He was going to teach them a lesson!Adolf met some other men and they became friends. They were all very angry and went about the place wearing frowns and glaring at people. They made a gang and the gang grew very big.One day Adolf was thrown in prison. Inside the prison he had an idea for a book and got another man to write it as he shouted out the words.Later when it was finished lots of people read it but it was a difficult read.When Adolf got out of the prison he decided to take over Germany. With the help of his gang he told everybody he would make things better and they believed him.When he became the leader of Germany he designed lots of nice clothes for his gang to wear and they built lots of beautiful buildings to match their fairytale ideas. They even made a building in a mountain and another one under the ground in Berlin.Also they invented stories about Germany's mythical past.Adolf never seemed happy and it was no surprise to his gang when he decided to invade Austria. He told the army to invade and they did. Next he invaded Czechoslovakia. Then it was on to Poland! Now he was having fun!But the other countries started to get worried. They thought he was going to invade their countries and make them all speak German and abolish laughing.The other countries decided to fight back. Adolf didn't like that. He became very very angry. He was angry every day. In fact he was furious!He was the 'furious Fuehrer'.Things didn't go well for Adolf. He wanted Russia to give some of its countryside to Germany but Russia didn't want to do that. They had a fight. At first Germany was winning but then it lost.The Russian soldiers English soldiers American soldiers and other token soldiers all ganged-up against Germany and beat the shit out if it.Adolf knew his enemies were going to get him so he killed himself. Then he got some of his gang to pour paraffin on his body and set fire to it so that it burnt him down to a tiny little cinder of evil.Then they put it somewhere very very safe.
Tuesday 9 February 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/sport/152328/comatose-kansas-city-fan-awakens-to-horrible-reality,Comatose Kansas City Fan Awakens to Horrible Reality,(NOT EDITED) An avid Kansas City Chiefs fan who has been in a coma since 5 minutes into the Super Bowl has finally awakened to a horrible reality. And close friends are unsure how to break it to him. According to witnesses Gunter Chang III a University of Kansas senior passed out with approximately 5 minutes into the first quarter and didn't regain consciousness until days later.“We’d been doing Jello shots since noon getting ready for the pre-game activities” said one man who declined to be identified but described pre-game activities as a game of “Bong Tag”. “We wanted to be in the right frame of mind when the Chiefs annihilated the Fuccaneers in the most undignified manner possible” said a friend of Chang. By all accounts Chang had consumed a massive amount of alcohol and 'epic' number of bong hits by the time the dumpster fire started in Tampa.“We knew something was wrong when Chang jumped up with his hands in the air and screamed ‘SCORE’ during the coin toss then threw up behind the couch!" said another disaster witness. “He throws up behind the couch all the time but usually not face down on the carpet. Later he thought the Chiefs scored a touchdown or something and it was just a commercial! Chang is not the most informed guy I've ever known but damn!” he added.Fortunately several people at the party rolled him out of the bubbling Jello pool of his own stomach contents when the sound of his gurgling distracted from demolition derby on the big screen TV. But not before getting some good video of the grotesque performance art taking place on the floor. A few tequila shots later Chang was just as good as new.In an effort to shake off the embarrassing spectacle on television as well as in their own living room the disillusioned dickheads hastily self-medicated with another round of bong hits. These were estimated to have been completed shortly before the second Chief's penalty and just after Chang exclaimed in a drunken slur "Man Ozzy Osbourne is looking a lot better these days!" while taking a staggering piss in the corner of the living room. Apparently Chang was oblivious to the fact that the crowd was made up of 30000 cardboard cut-outs. Or that the bathroom was down the hall."Chang is not the best informed guy I ever knew. Except about parties" said another friend who witnessed the entire train wreck. "He's the kind of guy who would light his own farts if he read it on the internet" admitted one frat brother who confessed to showing him exactly that on the internet. "I got good clicks on the video but I felt bad about him having the skin grafts on his balls."None of the other party goers even noticed when Chang had slipped into the netherworld in his chair a mere comatose shell of his normal drooling drunken self. Depressed and disillusioned they departed just deserting the drunk dude. Only days after the Super Bowl did it become apparent that Chang had been drunker than usual. In fact all in attendance had seen him in this condition many times before so no one panicked until Chang failed to show up for work Wednesday.“It was kind of strange for him not to show up for pay day” said a co-worker who was not at the Super Bowl event because he absolutely despises Chang enough at work. “Sure he’d miss Monday maybe even Tuesday. But never Wednesday. We get paid on Wednesday. So I knew he was either dead or in jail. Probably dead. Both I hope.”An unidentified friend of Chang fortunately returned to Chang's house to recover a bong he'd left to discover him in exactly the same position from three days ago in the Cheeto stained urine soaked chair. He rushed him to the hospital and dropped him off on the sidewalk after playing a few games on the XBox and getting stoned.Chang regained consciousness earlier today and immediately asked how big an “ass whooping” Kansas City inflicted on Tampa Bay. Things went south from there when another friend showed him a highlight photo of Tom Brady in a Tampa Bay uniform and convinced Chang he was in an alternate reality. "Chang is not the best informed person I ever knew. I know I'm going to Hell for this but the look on his face was priceless! I'm getting good hits on the video too.According to the attending physician “We’ve got him heavily sedated and convinced he doesn’t really want to know anymore about this reality than that!"

Silence was witnessed for the first time ever at the school."On the yellow line unlucky for some number 13" said Kenwood.Two students said:"Yey!"They'd put number 13 on their card. The rest of the class said:"Noooooooooo!"They hadn't.Taking an eternity to draw the balls from the bag under the pretence of trying to build up even more of an exciting atmosphere Kenwood eyed his watch and the super-slow motion on its second hand as it traversed its way around the dial."Blue. Two little ducks 22!""Yeeeeyyyyy!" said some little voices.In this fashion Bingo fought Time. Numbers were called and excited responses given. Eventually after what seemed like an eternity somebody said:"Bingo!"But this was a false call highlighting the importance of the correct pronunciation of the numbers 13 and 30.The game went on and on and on until the point when there was only one number remaining in the bag. Said the teacher:"Top of the shop green line number 50!"At this the roof was raised as every single one of the students called:"BINGO!"Then the bell sounded.

At that point the soldier kicked her in her vaginal area sending her smack dab into the snack dispenser that was directly behind the cockpit.Three bags of Tamale Flavored Corn Chips popped out which Septiano her emotional burro quickly ate.At that point Mrs. Johnson had lost her skirt and her granny panties were now hanging down around her ankles exposing a sight that sad to say will not be easy to un-see.A flustered nun sitting in the first row directly behind the fracas reached into her purse and took out a family-sized can of mace. She emptied the entire can all over Mrs. Johnson.The burro kicked the nun in her left ear and she fell onto the lap of a card-carrying vegetarian. He got up and the burro kicked him in his balls causing him to scream out 17 curse words; all in Yiddish.Finally airport security arrived and took Mrs. Johnson the Green Beret the nun the vegetarian and the burro into custody.Meanwhile the plane took off 14 minutes late with the remaining passengers all happily singing the theme song from Gilligan’s Island in Spanish.

Stifled because he can’t tweet about his displeasure of what an amateurish unprofessional bungling team he has defending him Donald Trumps regretting not having stuck with Rudy Giuliani.“At least Giuliani could talk. These two clowns are putting me to sleep and I don’t sleep much. Their hair is wrong; too dry and frizzy. And the suits they‘re wearing? Either wear black or navy blue but not that light blue crap. Biden dresses like a prince but those two look like census takers or morticians.”What difference does it make? The Senators will stick with you no matter what your lawyers do say or wear. The Senators will never vote to convict you at least not 17 of them. Maybe 10 or 11 but never 17. But then there's always that number 12 surprise. That guy looks like a maybe.But it won’t be because of the lawyers. The film of the riot was damaging. Your motivational speeches. Your propaganda saying the election was stolen. That they had to take their country back brainwashing what little brain they have sudsing it up with lies. All that makes it a slam dunk for your conviction!“Would you shut the f- -k up?”I can’t shut up. I’m your conscience. Forget the lawyer's frizzy hair. The Senators wouldn’t vote to convict you even if you had O.J. Simpson Louie Gohmert or Vladimir Putin defending you.“Maybe I can still get Giuliani…”I don't know about Giuliani. $20000 a day? He might want payment upfront. But those Senators will never vote to convict. At least not 17 of them.Read more by this author:
Wednesday 10 February 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/152323/football-pundits-talk-bollox,Football Pundits Talk Bollox,When Liverpool put seven goals past Crystal Palace just seven short weeks ago on 19 December the talk amongst football punditry was of "how far ahead of other football teams Jurgen Klopp's team are" how they were "uncatchable" and how "exquisite" was the football they were playing.One 'expert' said the title race was already over and that the other teams were merely playing for Champions League places.They're not saying that now.After the game on 19 December Liverpool were 5 points clear of second-placed Everton with Manchester City 8 points adrift. The Premier League title race was all but over.Fast forward 49 days however and everything has changed.After the Reds crumbled to a 4-1 home defeat at Anfield against their most dangerous rivals Manchester City on Sunday and last Thursday's humiliating 1-0 humbling by struggling Brighton - again at Anfield - the question has to be asked:"Aren't the 'experts' just talking a load of shite?"Their observations on events during a game are one thing but predicting that a Premier League season is over before Christmas has been reached seems unwise.Especially now that the prediction looks like a sick joke.At the same time as Liverpool were being hailed as "back-to-back champions" Manchester United were said to be "struggling". They were in 7th spot also 8 points behind Liverpool. One pundit said that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's men were "out of the picture" whilst another offered:"United are living in Liverpool's shadow."Not now. Indeed it took only two short weeks for these stupid comments to be tossed into the ever-growing skip of ridiculous tripe spoken by ex-footballers with nothing better to do than roll out of bed and drive their luxury cars to the nearest TV studio with a chin full of stubble and some ill-thought-out assessment of a team's prospects swimming around their empty heads.First a New Year's Day 2-1 victory over Aston Villa put United level on points with Liverpool and then a 1-0 victory at Turf Moor against Burnley on 12 January sent them top.The point of all this? Ex-footballers known about as much as I do or you do. Their comments and opinions are about as useful as background music in a supermarket or a lift. Something to fill the void before and after the game and if you must sit lifeless in front of the telly instead of going to make a cup of tea at halftime.There are droves of them: Don Hutchison Dion Dublin Tim Sherwood Leon Osman Robbie Savage Chris Sutton Glen Johnson Lee Dixon Michael Owen and a whole host of women football players whose names are unimportant. All with assured opinions that are about as accurate as that drunk at the bar last Saturday night or that bloke sitting behind you on the bus pouring shit from his mouth into your ears.Social commentator Moys Kenwood who is as irritated by ex-footballer football pundits as the next man said:"Fair enough they were decent players but that doesn't make them good speakers. Far from being satisfied with the rich undeserved trappings of their overpaid playing careers they now can't resist 'hugging the limelight' from the warmth and comfort of a studio spouting endless 'in-the-know' bullshit."Plus the host is always a woman.

While all the Republican Senators (except for Mitt Romney) got it dead wrong House Representative Liz Cheney Dick’s daughter got it 100% tap dancing right!Speaking as a patriot and knowledgeable of the Constitution Ms. Cheney said Donald Trump’s attempt to overthrow the 2020 election and the transfer of power by mob rule was an impeachable offense.Seems logical.So the Republican House members censured Liz Cheney.What?Apparently they believe attempting to overthrow a legal election by storming the Capitol Building vandalizing terrorizing destroying property stealing equipment and causing the death of six people is an okay part of Democracy.Maybe those very same Republicans who censured Ms. Cheney would find that kind of behavior okay if people were to break into their homes vandalize terrorize destroy steal property and carry on the same way the MAGA crowd did at the Capitol Building.No one would okay that kind of behavior in their home. Why would Republicans claim it’s okay in the Capitol Building? Donald Trump okayed and encouraged it. But Republican House members censure Liz Cheney?Are Republicans being hypocritical? Mon Dieu! Say it ain't so Joe.Liz Cheney said “There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution. I will vote to impeach the President.”Bravo Liz Cheney! Shame on Republicans.Read more by this author:
Thursday 11 February 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/uk/152315/britains-first-nail-bar-for-dogs-opens,Britain's first nail bar for dogs opens,Many businesses have been forced to shut down during the pandemic some of them permanently. But not all shops are suffering badly.This week in Chaffinch St Cock Britain's first nail bar for dogs opened. Canine Chaffinch Nails is subject to the same COVID restrictions as any other business but because it caters for dogs its customers do not need to break any rules to enter the shop.The dogs must enter alone while their owners wait outside. The pooches have access to a menu of full French manicures and pedicures while their owners are given a copy of either Razzle or Glamour while they wait.Rex Bone 47 is a happy customer. His dog called Geoffroy Hamilton is a St Bernard with perfectly manicured nails. "Woof" said Geoffroy when asked about how he was treated."People always thought I was mad to give my dog a manicure at home" said Bone. "But I'm happy to pay for it instead. It saves on the varnish. Geoffroy always likes to lick his claws afterwards and the varnish I use makes him excitable and puke a lot. Also when I go to Canine Chaffinch Nails I can have a wank while I wait. Everybody's happy."Dog nail bar owner Rover Barking 51 is a peculiar man. "I love nothing more than nice bright hyponychium. I used to run another shop. It was a combined nail bar and DIY shop called El Condor Pasa but I had to close it down what with the pandemic."So then I spotted an opportunity. I always used to get people in the nail bar saying they wished they had extra fingers so that they could have more nails to paint. I would offer to paint their dogs' nails as well. Now those are the only ones I can do. It's the dog's bollocks."I practice on my own dog. She's called Julie Williams. There's only one thing I won't do and that's the dewclaw. If you want that painted you'll have to go to Uncle Spot's Dewclaw Emporium across town."

'I mean there were the three Expendables films the one with Miranda Hart as a secretary and Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels but then we looked at it all on the Internet and there are more than forty films he has been in. If we watch one a day that is nearly six weeks of our lives gone.'Lorraine continued: 'Yes I forgot he had been so prolific. I mean there is Parker with Jennifer Lopez and a film with James Franco which I think I would much rather miss.''We don't have to do it' said Gary hopefully.'No I said we would like our marriage and gold' replied Lorraine cryptically.

I was hoping for more than this maybe some sexual activity or a few other people to look at and listen to but no nothing like that at all.'Barrington said: 'Oh I remember taking the cone home but I regretted it as soon as I did it and now I am stuck with it but it is a defining part of my existence and personality so I guess that we are stuck with each other now.'

I am simply delivering a package you bought from Amazon. We delivery drivers and postmen and women are here to do social service.

Stefano's Somewhat Inaccurate Movie Reviews,Here's a bunch of movies you'll want to check out after you read my somewhat inaccurate reviews."Star Trek - The Motion Picture" - A bald chick flies the rocketship Enterprise straight into a galaxy gravity pull and needs the crew to fix her really big cable TV satellite dish."Taxi Driver" - Robert De Niro breaks the Fourth Wall 30 years before Deadpool did by asking the audience if they're talking to him. They were. So was I."The Godfather" - This is the greatest movie of all time with the greatest actors and the greatest musical score and the greatest EVERYTHING!!!! (Hey it's about the MOB-- do you seriously think I'm gonna say anything negative about it???!!! Get reall!!!) Most excellent of excellent movies!"Planet Of The Apes" - A monkey man touches Charlton Heston with his sticky paws and pisses him off. That would annoy me too. If you're going to eat bananas with your bare hands wash them before you approach a guy like Heston! (He was kinda touchy about those things!)"Ghostbusters" - Bill Murray plays Bill Murray and uses a gun with radioactive silly string to catch fat hungry ghosts."Raiders Of The Lost Ark" - Han Solo plays adventurer Idaho Jones and shoots a poor slob that brought a knife to a gunfight. Hijinks ensue."The Notebook" - A depressed woman has a diary with all kinds of entrties about a depressed man. Hijinks ensue."The Silence Of The Lambs" - A confusing movie where Jodie Foster never visits a petting zoo or even owns a lamb. Later she talks to a guy wearing a mask that inspired WWE superstar Mick Foley to wear a similar one."A Clockwork Orange" - Here's my review: e4384hebskdnaidbsgwt wuwl^&nswhw2393h3bdbdjdkekekene beajdjjrkkepwonn33od jdndm@soejebe7. And a half. My review makes about as much sense as the actual movie."Ace Ventura Pet Detective" - Jim Carrey plays a viscious cold-blooded hostile killing machine that relentlessly follows a harmless guy around town uttering threats and nearly blowing up his apartment building because the guy looked at his sister on the subway. Oh wait-- that's my real-life situation! (Honestly Bugsy I was just looking in your sister's direction at a photo of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau when I yelled out "You suck eggs you girly-man!"

He was given the water and the sandwich but the commanding officer asked him why he wanted a cell phone.He replied that he wanted to call his camel insurance agent so he could cancel his camel insurance policy.Swiss authorities have agreed to turn the Taliban leader over to the United States government who will be imprisoning him in the infamous Guantanamo Bay Prison in Cuba.While at Gitmo Mohammed will be fed a diet of squirrel balls tree leaves and aardvark milk.

Even so I wish I had a tenner for each one!"The United captain explained:"The one about Jamie Vardy was true and that temper tantrums one but how could anybody possibly believe there was any credibility in the one about me being seen mincing in the Arndale Centre or that ridiculous one about the Norwich City fan abduction? Plus I thought Albert Camus was the left-back at Paris St. Germain."But he admitted:"Someone did shit in me football boots. That was real."There was little sympathy for the player however bearing in mind he receives £189000 a week salary whilst many families and old people in Britain struggle to make ends meet often having to make a straight choice between whether to eat something or turn the gas fire on.

Trump. He claimed his reelection was stolen. Boo Hoo!Every loser’s lament.Trump failed to win the popular vote and didn't come near winning the electoral college vote. A loss is a loss. Why cry about it and make the scene more embarrassing? Man up!It’s called sportsmanship. Does Trump cheat about his golf score? Well it was revealed he cheated on his three wives but golf too? What about his tax returns? His school grades at Wharton are said to have been consigned to Davy Jones Locker.Trump's lie about his loss started the day after the election on November 4. It continued for weeks and months through the Holidays belly-aching with tweets at rallies Fox interviews and continuing until January 6 the day the Capitol Building was vandalized.Who knew Trump would turn out to be such a crybaby? Hillary Clinton showed more cajones than Trump. Hillary was ahead in the polls and afterward a bipartisan Senate report affirmed the U.S. intelligence community’s conclusion that the Russians interfered with the 2016 election to benefit Trump.If Republican Senators fail to convict Donald Trump for the dead and injured terrorizing House and Senate members and the vandalized Capitol Building the travesty of January 6 will remain a permanent stain in this nation’s democracy.As though stopping the certification would have legally thrown the election to Donald Trump giving him four more years in the White House.It’s an example of pure Donald Trump bird-brained thinking!Read more by this author:

"He wanted them to write or call their congressmen immediately and tell them to change their votes that's all."

I try to make the site as presentable as possible and to weed out the rubbish. So to be criticized in this manner was almost too much for me to withstand. It's very upsetting."Kenwood wondered the organization being as "crass" as it is whether or not the gentleman might decide to take his material somewhere that more readily appreciates it in the future.He said:"I'm no twit. I don't even do Twitter."
Friday 12 February 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/uk/152358/anthea-turner-overdrive,Anthea Turner Overdrive,Pub band Anthea Turner Overdrive are cursing the fact that while the erstwhile Television Presenter is trending on Twitter they have not seen an upsurge in visits to their website or Twitter feed.The band are a popular live act around the Norfolk Area playing songs from the 1960s and 1970's as well as their own Progressive Rock epics such as Iron and Fishmongers of the World Unite and Fly Scratching itself with a confusion of legs. They have not been gigging since March 2020 but have been working on an album during the lockdown.Lead singer John said 'We called ourselves Anthea Turner Overdrive as a joke like Bachman Turner Overdrive did but it caught on. I mean our audiences tend to be older than their forties so most of them know all about irony and remember Anthea Turner as a judgemental cleaner so we just went with it. I must admit I am disappointed that no-one new is following us it seems to have been a great opportunity to increase our marketing strategy'.Rival band Sue Pollard's Innertube have seen no more demand for their work following the Penny Crayon stars outbursts on Myspace.

Turner has shown herself to be a humanitarian with a firm grasp on the Covid-19 situation. We will never need doctors and other health professionals sharing their years of experience with us ever again will we?Twitter tells you what strangers had for breakfast but it also reminds you of the horrors of your youth.Next week Zammo from Grange Hill will be giving his opinion on Roman History.

In a budget-saving program De Blasio stated that the City’s maintenance crew had to repaint the red fire hydrants every two years because of the rust caused from dogs pissing on them while doing their daily walk.Upon the installation of the revolving hydrants it was found that the dogs would attempt to keep up with the slow revolution of the hydrant while trying to walk on three legs the other one lifted as is customary among most breeds of canines.As documented by Maintenance Chief George Mahoney the average dog lasted approximately 31 seconds before getting vertigo and falling into its own urine. Once trained the dog would avoid hydrants from then on peeing on trees and tires instead. Mahoney estimated that while each new hydrant cost $67000 to install the City would amortize the cost of the revolving hydrants in approximately 44 years.Dr. Slim: “The only answer is robotic mutts.”Dirty: “Yo Dr. Dude. Just charge their battery and watch ‘em hump.”

It’s water under the bridge. Those who died can’t be resurrected. Those injured will recover. It’s a 'so what?' situation. Get over it! Tomorrow is another day. January 6 will be so last month.Maybe Donald Trump made an oops.Sometimes sounding like a combined Valley Girl and Scarlet O’Hara Republicans continue to defend Donald Trump blindly. Former Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said “Get over it!”Was the wisdom of Solomon ever more flippant?If Republicans were jurors at Nuremberg the Nazis would have gotten off. Their next try would have finished humanity.If Trump’s actions are ignored during his present conviction trial before the US Senate and Trump is cleared he’ll be back or his nemesis will be back and next time a Trumpian could win and as Solomon never said “So long Democracy.”Republicans aren’t stupid. They recognize what a high crime and misdemeanor is and what an attempt to overthrow the government looks like. But they’re afraid of the big bad angry bull crouching in Florida that’s going to get them if they don't watch out.They’ll go for splitting the baby in two destroy Democracy what our parents cherished and what men and women have died for in wars since the American Revolution.George Bernard Shaw said it as eloquently as Solomon has never said Democracy is a device that ensures we shall be governed no better than we deserve.Those who value truth and justice deserve better.Read more by this author:

One Tom Smith 62 said:"Yes his wife likes a bit of 'slap and tickle' if that's what they still call it. She'll be over the moon!"Ron said:"My wife Madge is a keen 'bedroom player' and is often too keen for me. It's true to say that I sometimes have trouble 'keeping up' with her if you know what I mean. Now I won't have to!"Madge 38 already has a dildo that Ron doesn't know about.

He then told his mother they should go to the farm at the end of their street and that she should hide a needle in one of the farmer's haystacks for her son to attempt to find.Off they went. As Woodson hid his eyes his mam hid the needle. That having been done the search commenced.There were two interruptions for snow but Woodson kept at it until the search had to called off as darkness closed in.This morning however they were back at the site at 7 o'clock and at 11:40 came the breakthrough.Mr. Woodson admitted later:"It wasn't as easy as I'd thought it might be but not as difficult as she said it would be."

She said she hated the color blue with a passion and up until she was 2 only wore pink.Her current record is 17-1. She is planning on traveling to America to appear on her favorite American daytime talk show The Ellen DeGeneres Show.

Trump confessed in tears that he was guilty yes guilty of inciting the mob and should be punished. But not too much.Republican House and Senate members were shocked speechless and underwhelmed.No way they insisted. Trump was definitely not guilty. He would never be found guilty during his present conviction trial. Republican Senators were ready to aquit Trump of any charges weeks before any testimony was even presented.Some had even managed to place bets in Vegas that Trump would be acquitted. Any criminal confession on Trump’s part would produce a Vegas loss. A not guilty verdict is in the bag. No need to confess anything they insisted.He was also reminded of what Nikki Haley had said: "Get over it.""No no no" Trump insisted while drinking his strawberry milkshake with the chocolate sprinkles. He planned all along to overturn the election because he believed the election had been short-wired.Like a choir in perfect harmony the Senators all rolled their collective eyes. “This time he’s definitely gone off the tracks.”After listening to a recording of his January 6 speech which Trump hadn't heard while reading it on the teleprompter he realized: He was guilty of inciting the riot. He had to take the punishment and he was going to man up.Ted Cruz fainted.“Can I have another strawberry milkshake and no chocolate sprinkles because they get stuck in the straw? But add lots of whipped cream and chocolate syrup.”Read more by this author:

The verdict was 57 to 43. There’s a 14 point difference. In a football game that would have been a loss. Even Donald Trump can see it wasn’t a unanimous win or a real victory.In the world of Albert Einstein Galileo Jeff Bezos and God a 57 to 43 score is a loss for Trump. Getting impeached once is horrendous. Getting impeached twice is a tattoo on the forehead reading Incompetant Turd.Pass the MAGA hat.Voted for conviction by the Senate and ending up with 57 to 43 is a conviction. Sugarcoat it as much as Republicans would like with the claim of a required two-thirds majority or a 67 vote majority is as Nostradamus might say “Baloney.”So Republicans are giving one another high fives. “Beat the rat again!”No! Barack Obama was never impeached. Neither was Hillary Clinton. Bet money Joe Biden won’t be impeached. Neither will Kamala Harris.If articles of impeachment were never brought upon Donald Trump yes that would be a win. It would also be a miracle. But it happened twice and it ain’t anything to brag about or call a victory. To be impeached from the highest office in the world? Yikes!How did Trump get there in the first place? Oh yes the election was stolen from Hillary Clinton. No wonder Trump knew exactly how to accuse Joe Biden of the various steps in stealing an election.57 to 43 is a conviction.Read more by this author:

It will be constructed of Tungastillican-4 which is about 168020 psi. and can withstand the fury of a category 8 hurricane.Musk says that the USS Vesuvius will orbit the Red Planet (Mars) at a speed of 893000 mph.He noted that it will fly so fast that scientifically it will be where it was a mere 1.2 seconds before or as his personal secretary the current reigning Miss Louisiana Zoe Jo Bedloe 19 stated the belt station will fly like a damn mothereffer.The cost of the belt station will be about $8.8 trillion 25% of which will be funded by USS Vesuvius donation funds from the elementary school children of the states of Texas Oklahoma and Vermont.Musk is really excited about the project and adds that if things go as planned Mars could conceivably have an NBA basketball team by the year 2027.

"How could this pointless charade not come to a slightly less meaningless end?" he asked while making today's batch of special sauce. Bette Midler who some say was once a dancer or something said that Trump "probably killed at least a hundred people" and would get away with it because everyone but her was stupid. Meanwhile congressional page Eric Swalwell mistook the word “CALvary” to mean “CAValry” in a bombshell twitter post that proved as he put it that Jesus rode a horse while carrying the cross. Swalwell was picking his nose at the time.I would say something about Alexandra Ocasio Cortez but it’s just too easy.Soon-to-be former senator Mitt Romney whose contribution to his constituents is making up a fake Twitter account bragged that if he ran for president again "he would lose to ANYONE in the Obama family!" For his part former president Trump extended an olive branch by admitting “I made some significant mistakes while in office. But being nice to these wipes wasn’t one of them.”

She told Ron:"Bye!""She didn't even call a taxi" wrote Ron on Facebook. "She caught the bus."Madge was confirmed by immigration officials at North Sea Ferries Alexandra Dock terminal as having boarded the overnight service to Rotterdam.The man who checked her passport said:"She was in a real hurry and travelling light. She had just two pieces of carry-on luggage - a small bag and what looked like a large Black Pudding."

Amazingly it grasped the groove inside and slid into position!Kenwood was triumphant. He stood Malina on the floor and in a little girl's dolly voice said:"Oh! Thank you for putting my leg back on Daddy! You're so clever! Now I can walk again! Hooray!"He then dressed her in her black shorts to protect her dignity.Kenwood said later:"Well she'll have to tread carefully for a while but she looks OK for now."
Sunday 14 February 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/uk/152371/the-valentines-day-tradition-that-gets-the-cream,The Valentine's Day tradition that gets the cream,Many Valentine's Day traditions are modern commercial and trashy - the giving of cards the pressure to send flowers - these are all recent inventions. Yet there is one popular tradition that is still going and started all the way back with St Valentine himself.Sir Duncan Valentine was no saint - at least until he was canonised by Pope Sodom III a thousand years later. Valentine often frequented prostitutes particularly enjoying what he called "a happy hand" but which later became more widely known as the "creamy glove".Today hookers across the world have their busiest day on Valentine's Day when lonely men or husbands whose wives are incapable or unwilling to strain their wrists will hire them for some creamy glove action.Even the current pandemic cannot prevent the mass wanking. Many whores are respecting social distancing measures and happily jerking off their customers through letterboxes and air vents retooled as makeshift gloryholes.In Japan the tradition has taken a sinister yet futuristic turn. Pleasure robots called Wifey-wanku sell millions and perform exactly the same function.Japanese businessman Jeffu Ono is one of many men who actually married his Wifey-wanku. "It very convenient" he said. "Never complain and can also be useful to stuff turkey on Jesus-brunch day."One advantage of the Wifey-wanku is that it takes up so little space. This comes in extra handy when considering the limited space in Japanese apartments many of which are the size of a Portaloo. (Incidentally this is what led to the large number of Portaloos currently available as rental properties).So wherever you are and however you get your creamy glove have a satisfying Valentine's Day. Nggh-sorry-I-kumu-nau as they say in Japan.

Now he can run again and cause another coup attempt. Next time thanks to the 43 he might get lucky.History won’t be written on paper towels. But history will remember Trump as an anomaly a joke a buffoon a traitor who wanted his vice president hanged attempted to overturn the election he lost caused an attempted coup but was cleared and vindicated by 43 Senators who took a knee to Donald Trump. Amen.Granted maybe Donald Trump is politically recognized as the bottom of the barrel a draft dogger an adulterer a Jeffrey Epstein pal but what about the 43 Republican Senators who voted to acquit him?Ted Cruz fainted. Again.Do they ever use mirrors? Can they look at themselves without squinting? Do they tell their children and grandchildren:"Yep it's okay to give the green light to hang your Vice President?Yep if you lose the election you can scream cheater cheater. The election was stolen start a riot kill a few people vandalize property and threaten to put a bullet in the House Speaker's head.All of that is okay son. Mary Jane go to the kitchen with your mother.Really?The rest of the world watched on February 13 and witnessed how the Democracy of the United States works or should not have worked. The date of 2/13 is worse than 9/11.On 9/11 an enemy came from across the planet. On 2/13 the enemy was in the US Senate. Just 43 United States Senators voted to acquit Donald J. Trump.History remembers Benedict Arnold. The 43 Senators will also be remembered by history.Read more by this author:

At 06.00 AM the snow and ice was still frozen. However after six-hours hiking in the Black Forest Germany suddenly the snow underfoot started to melt rapidly!Knowing they still had 4 hours to go Siegfried Laufer hobby hiker looked down at his boots and realised the surrounding melting snow was gradually entering his hiking boots causing massive discomfort. He asked his colleagues to stop for a minute so he could drain his boots. Removing a pair of soggy woolly socks he managed to get the melted snow out but replacing his soggy socks was not the solution.An hour later Siegfried's boots were now brimming over with water and step for step drowning his feet! He could not manage another step so his colleagues called the emergency service and told them their colleague was drowning in his boots!They sent a helicopter out to save him from drowning. After arriving at the scene of the pending disaster the doc on board realised there was no deep water in the vicinity and nobody drowning. He rushed over to the group of hikers and asked where the victim was.They pointed to Siegfried's soggy socks and boots filled with water then the Euro dropped! Siegrfried was flown back to base given a bill for 2000 Euros and was advised to buy a pair of decent hiking boots and not those from Aldi for 10 Euros!Siegfried is now suing Aldi but they have told him to "Fick Dich" because their hiking boots Made in Swaziland are not suitable for hiking in the freezing Black Forest only in dry desert regions and he should have read the safety instructions!

Not just because no one will be around to validate the prediction but because very few colleges offer courses on the subject. Other than La Fontaine College the Harvard of the Caribbean there is no other school in the Western Hemisphere that includes this course in their curriculum.Offering a doctorate degree in the discipline La Fontaine’s Department of Doomsday is headed by Eoj Nedib a descendant of the first Mayan medicine man and soothsayer Hokum Nedib. Of ancillary coincidental value - some say it’s more than that - is the fact that Eoj Nedib spelled backwards = Joe Biden.In an interview with CNN’s intrepid reporter Don Lemon President Biden when informed of this factoid tilted his mouth into a crooked smile telling reporters that he was somewhat aware that his Irish ancestry might have been tinted by a chance encounter of one of his forefathers with a Mayan princess on holiday in Dublin around 500 years ago.Moving forward Professor Nedib wearing an ancient Mayan headdress similar to the one worn by Carnac the Magnificent a “mystic from the East” who could psychically “divine” unknown answers to unseen questions was handed the envelope containing the ultimate question:Putting the hermetically-sealed envelope to his forehead Professor Nedib rolls his eyes upward and responds:“The end of the world.”Blowing the envelope open the Professor purses his lips and reads the question from the previously hermetically-sealed envelope that has been certified by a nationally recognized accounting firm:“What happens when Kamala Harris becomes president?”Dr. Slim: “Only a seer with mystic gifts could divine an unknown answer to an unseen question.”Dirty: “Yo Dr. Dude. Makes you wonder if the guy is on to something.”

She sang "Gosh Darn Damnit All If I Ain’t With Child Again" by Loretta Lynn.She did not please any of the judges who said she should stick to being a waitress at her local hometown Dairy Queen in Cricket Balls Mississippi.Her father got so upset at his baby girl being rejected that he slammed his $27 Walmart guitar against the American Idol's $13000 piano.Security rushed in put him in handcuffs and took him away with Darlene crying and saying that her daddy has had a drinking problem ever since an egg-laying hen bit him on his scrotum back in 2011.Next up was Marco del Marco from Passaic New Jersey. Marco was dressed as a New York Jets football player. He sang the Celine Dion hit song "I'm Not Anorexic I'm Just Short as Hell".All three judges hated him and he got three nos.

I've never quit anything in my life and I'm not going to start quitting now!"There was some murmuring and a giggle.The Senate had earlier found him not guilty of inciting an insurrection at Capitol Hill on 6 January and an abuse of power.Trump complained that the wording used in government business was often archaic and difficult to understand. He asked:"What's a 'buse'? Can anybody help me with that?"

"Thank God Vince didn't get anywhere near my Mollie Sugden Russ Abbott or Robin Nedwell."An unpublished version of a story bearing the same headline like this one which involved Starr's corpse being devoured by rabid hamsters which had gnawed their way into his coffin was shelved as it was felt it was in poor taste. One would also assume that the taste of Starr's rotting corpse would also have been somewhat 'poor'.

Legends of lost gold mines and the crusted white skeletons of dead miners who stood sentinel over their staked claims while grey-bearded vultures picked their bones give testimony to the dangers that await anyone who dares to challenge this scorched hell.Anyone who understands the Quasimodo Effect realizes that even one mistake in this unforgiving environment might lead to one’s demise. And that is why there are ten million stories in the naked desert. This is but one of them.The searing rays of the sun crept over the horizon later than the day before; it was the day after the summer solstice and the sunlight was less menacing than yesterday’s by a matter of seconds. Moisture was nowhere to be seen but evident nonetheless. The Saguaro cacti with thorny arms reaching for the sky cast long shadows that offer precious shade for rattlesnakes and armadillos to embrace each other free and oblivious to the spider mites who were unwilling spectators to the rapacious carnality of reptiles gone wild; possibly a plus for non-binary casual observers.And now for the rest of the story:TO BE CONTINUED....Dr. Slim: “I’m beginning to smell a rat.”Dirty: “Yo Dr. Dude.

However every dark cloud filled with sleet has a silver lining!Jo Johannson of British decent but now 'Double-Dutch' was driving his old-timer Volvo through black-ice-covered-streets when suddenly his Volvo without ABS or ASR safety gadgets skidded and hit an ancient lamppost. A freezing stray dog had just peed up it making it even more slippery!The reason Joseph was driving in lockdown was; he was heading to a local hospice because of his agonising back-pain caused by a slip disc OUCH! Locals rushed to the scene and helped Joseph out of his car.After three weeks of agony whilst attempting to get out of bed he stood up and screamed "Eureka!!" The locals stood back in astonishment! One onlooker rung up the local loony bin! Joseph then started 'Dancing in the Street' to a Bowie/Jagger classic coincidentally playing on his Jurassic cassette recorder.He leapt up and down the street resembling Nureyev without his tights and yelled "painless I am painless at last I am painless I want to be free!" (After reading this garbage Queen will be suing the writer for plagiarism)A huge white van arrived the male hunky nurses captured Joseph stuck him in a straight-jacket and sped off to the local Cuckoo's Nest. Later in the day a Nutty Professor called Ziggy Freud realised why Joseph was dancing like a loony after seeing his appointment at the hospital for a slipped-disc operation! The collision jolted his slipped-disc back into place and Joseph now painless decided to celebrate as if it was carnival 2021 which has been called off because of Covid-19!His ancient Volvo is now a write-off but a local Volvo dealer offered him a brand-new hybrid version with ABS and ASR. Joseph declined their offer and demanded they repair his ancient model. They refused so he is now busy painless searching for a Volvo-Old-Timer-Bone-Shaker just in case his disc slips out again!"Crash therapy beats any op neurologists can offer" he now proclaims!
Tuesday 16 February 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/world/152388/following-airline-tragedy-red-bull-will-no-longer-give-you-wings,Following Airline Tragedy Red Bull Will No Longer Give You Wings,The National Transportation Safety Board reached the conclusion of their investigation of flight 267 today reporting that the aircraft’s left engine had suffered a catastrophic failure after a 6’2 34-year-old man with wings crossed the plane’s flight path.The investigation corroborates eyewitness reports on the ground who said that the man identified as San Jose resident Brandon Enzinger had phenomenally sprouted wings after drinking a Red Bull energy beverage.“We were coming back from lunch” recalled Mike Boyd a friend and co-worker of Brandon’s. “He said he needed some pep so he chugged a Red Bull and next thing I know he’s levitating above us like some sort of superhero.”According to Boyd two sets of wings grew from Brandon’s heels and proceeded to lift him off of the ground. “He was amazed - I mean we all were we cheered him on. He just kept going higher. You know that scene in Willy Wonka when Charlie drinks the soda and floats uncontrollably toward that big fan? That was basically what happened except Charlie was Brandon and the fan was a Boeing 737.” When asked to recount the details of the crash itself Boyd stated “Well he got sucked into a fucking jet engine.”The NTSB investigation revealed that when Enzinger collided with the engine his large frame and body mass created what aircraft mechanics have described as a "meat pie" - a catastrophic mix of flesh and bone that will spell disaster for any aircraft.Outrage has poured in since the incident but the company is not alone when it comes to stirring up controversy. In fact Monster Energy has also come under fire recently after a bevy of reports revealed that consumers had been transforming into werewolves and mercilessly beating their wives. While they have yet to make a public statement experts have suggested that the lycanthropic side-effect may be attributed to the drink’s demographic which is primarily made up of white men in their late-20s with an affinity for dirt bikes Kottonmouth Kings and the movie Alpha Dog.Even the relative newcomer Bang Energy has had to adjust its business model. The company was forced to alter its recipe after the original was deemed a Class-A narcotic by the DEA. The decision was made following the infamous “Rainbow Unicorn Incident” in which 15-year-old Trevor Brooks managed to obliterate half a city block after ingesting a can of the bubblegum-flavored drink.The tragedy of flight 267 is only the most recent in a string of events that have brought to question the necessity of energy drinks with many wondering if the risks are even worth the below average taste that they provide. In a response to the investigation and the crash Red Bull released the following statement:“We here at Red Bull are super-sorry about your dead family members. This most recent event does not represent the values and culture that we’ve built here at Red Bull. Red Bull isn’t really a drink it’s an idea; created by children. Going forward we have decided to discontinue the old Red Bull and bring you…the new Red Bull which promises to be a safer Red Bull without compromising the satisfying and refreshing flavor that you’ve come to know from Red Bull. Enjoy Red Bull. Fuck you.”Backlash mounted online after the statement’s release criticizing that the announcement was tone-deaf and did little in the way to bring closure to the victims and their families. Acknowledging the criticism Red Bull followed up on the statement by promising to donate all 2% of the proceeds to black-owned businesses.On the heels of the investigation and looking down the barrel of a time-consuming and expensive legal battle only time will tell if Red Bull will ever be able to fully recover. In the meantime a recall has been issued for Old Red Bull while New Red Bull is slated to hit shelves on March 15th.

And the hair? What kind of personality defect produces that repeated aberration? Remember the navy blue tent overcoat used to hide his hips and belly the under-eye white concealer and the spray tan?Biden is streamlined.Now at last the White House has a GQ Vogue model who can wear Ray-Bans a bomber jacket and jeans or a pinstripe suit with a striped shirt white-collar and check tie. And Biden’s hair doesn’t look silly.The guy is a fashion plate. Who knew?Only a couple of weeks in office Biden hasn’t picked a relative to take over his presidency and excuse himself to watch television all day. Things are getting back to normal. COVID-19 is still a bear to wrestle with but at least it isn’t being ignored.“Let them drink Lysol!”Who could have thought Marie Antoinette’s Let them eat cake would one day be a reasonable suggestion?Biden is offering policies to rebuild the nation. Ahhhh infrastructure repairs by Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg. Finally bridges that don’t collapse paved roads without roadkill potholes and high-speed rail reducing pollution.Martha would agree “Now that’s a good thing.”No more dictators as pals. Mr. Putin how many rooms in your new palace? The palace you won't let your people see? The one that's supposed to cost millions and millions of rubles?And finally that wicked wall is coming down.

Exclusive to The Spoof. Early this morning on President's Day activists from the various groups that have been toppling Confederate statues invaded the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall and vandalized the monument. The famous statue of Abraham Lincoln sitting as in deep thought was toppled his head severed and the statue destroyed."We did this because Lincoln was not the abolitionist we have been taught to believe. Instead in his famous letter to New York Tribune editor Horace Greeley Lincoln made clear he had no intention of ending slavery with his Emancipation Proclamation. Its purpose was to coerce the South back into the Union through a promise that if the Rebellion ended they could keep their slaves. What kind of abolitionist is that?"George Washington owned slaves. Will his monument topple next?

Pillnitzer of Doc Holliday Medical University in Tombstone Arizona has said that this sports withdrawal malady is the worst he has seen in his 42 years of medical practice.He noted that most men are refusing to get medical help for their NFL football withdrawal syndrome which can become a potentially devastating illness. He added that this malady does not affect women; noting that their sports hormones are a whole lot stronger.The Sports Bet Gazette disclosed that many wives and girlfriends of these individuals are extremely concerned as some men have gotten so bad that they refuse to go to work mow the lawn or in extreme cases drink beer.One woman in Norwegian Wood Kentucky said that her husband went to the store a few days ago to buy beer cigarettes Tostitos and a head of cabbage and has yet to return.Another woman in Guacamole Grove California told her husband's mom that her husband has refused to eat and has dropped down from 372 pounds to 341 in just one week.Dr. Pillnitzer suggests that wives girlfriends and children can get help for their husbands boyfriends or daddies by calling 1-800-ITSOVER.

Initially the then owner wanted the team to be called the Winchester 76ers but that name was already taken by a semi-pro soccer team in Costa Rica.So after having a ‘A Name My Team’ contest the name Colt 45’s was chosen from a list of 14103 names; which included; the Blue Bayous the Red Riders the Yellowjackets and the Purple Possums.When Crane was asked why he wanted to drop the name Astros he said that there were two reasons. One he wanted to get rid of the reminder of the infamous sign-stealing scandal. And two he never liked the first two letters of the name ‘as.’Crane told the sports media that he has just purchased 9000 more fan cardboard cutouts to give the stadium a more fuller look.He pointed out that 36 of the new cutouts will be of the entire Dallas Cowboys cheerleading squad.

He claims this was Alisson.The allegation gained weight at Leicester at the weekend when Alisson again blundered - this time in the style of a local Sunday League player - presenting Jamie Vardy with the simplest of opportunities to score the Foxes' second goal.Police say they will leave no stone unturned in their bid to bring the guilty to book.

Wednesday 17 February 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152397/donald-trump-announces-3rd-divorce,Donald Trump Announces 3rd Divorce,Stop the presses! This is a surprise. Guess who is getting a divorce? Donald Trump! But here's the real surprise: it isn’t from Melania but from of all people Rudolph Giuliani!It was the dripping hair color. Soooo un-Trump! One inch maybe. Ivanka’s roots show for about an inch once in a while. But Giuliani’s color drip wasn’t at the roots and the drips went all the way down his face and neck. And on both sides. Say what you may about Donald’s hair the fake color has never been seen to drip.What was even more disturbing (and may have hammered the final nail in the coffin of marriage) was holding a campaign press conference on the street in front of a porn shop and a crematorium.Downer.So the divorce is on. Trump blames Giuliani for losing the election.Losing? What?Wasn’t the attempted coup/revolution at the Capitol on January 6 because the election was stolen? Hasn’t Trump been predicting that if he lost the election it would be because it was rigged and would be stolen? Isn’t that why Trump told his followers that they had to march down to the Capitol to fight and stop the certification or they would lose the country because the election was stolen?No judge is going to grant a divorce with that kind of conflict. Certainly Giuliani didn’t steal the election from Trump. Why would Trump blame Giuliani?Maybe it's just a lover’s spat? The judge might recommend counseling to get these two folks together.Read more by this author:

He claimed it was an overnight stay.All that was sufficiently incriminating but the belly over the belt was the real second atrocity.He may think he looks cool but he looked a mess. The visual was bad. The good news if it can be called good was that he was wearing a shirt. Short sleeve ugh but at least the shirt covered a full-frontal naked view.He claimed after he was caught to be chaperoning his daughters on the flight. Yeah so why the pregnant suitcase for an overnight flight? You have maybe an inflatable mattress folded up in there?Chaperoning daughters also traveling with their mother? Gee the girls sure don’t look like a pair of wild savages who must be restrained from climbing into the overhead playing tag in the aisles or smoking in the laboratory.Good try with chaperoning but no reprieve.But the belly? Caramba! Do some sit-ups wear a jacket or stay home behind a desk a large desk representing your constituents. People are dying from the freeze in Texas. People need running water. They're told to boil water. They have no gas or electricity to boil water or to stay warm. They need generators for warmth. Also food in other words stay home and do your job.Or quit your job give it to Beto O'Rourke and go back to Cancun.Read more by this author:

Now with some license requested the reader will be transformed into an imaginary world where they will be made witness - as earlier promised - to the epic confrontations between Wile E Biden and the Trump Runner.Using the mandatory list of rules instituted by Chuck Jones to set strict rules of engagement between the two original adversaries - then implementing arcane counter-reverse Quasimodo shuffle techniques to apply Anthropomorphic animal characteristics to humans - namely Joe Biden and Donald Trump I promise to take no liberties as I apply them functionally to the epic battle between Wile E Biden and the Trump Runner in a series of stories that will knock your socks off.THE RULES:RULE 1. THE TRUMP RUNNER CANNOT HARM WILE E BIDEN EXCEPT BY GOING "MEEP-MEEP!”RULE 2. NO OUTSIDE FORCE CAN HARM WILE E BIDEN - ONLY HIS OWN INEPTITUDE OR THE FAILURE OF ACME PRODUCTS.RULE 3. WILE E BIDEN COULD STOP ANYTIME - IF HE WERE NOT A FANATIC (REPEAT: "A FANATIC IS ONE WHO REDOUBLES HIS EFFORT WHEN HE HAS FORGOTTEN HIS AIM.") - GEORGE SANTAYANARULE 4. NO DIALOGUE EVER EXCEPT "MEEP-MEEP!"RULE 5. THE TRUMP RUNNER MUST STAY ON THE TRUMP - OTHERWISE LOGICALLY HE WOULD NOT BE CALLED TRUMP RUNNER.RULE 6. ALL ACTION MUST BE CONFINED TO THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT OF THE TWO CHARACTERS - THE WORLD STAGE.RULE 7. ALL MATERIALS TOOLS WEAPONS OR MECHANICAL CONVENIENCES MUST BE OBTAINED FROM THE ACME CORPORATION.RULE 8. WHENEVER POSSIBLE MAKE GRAVITY WILE E BIDEN’S GREATEST ENEMY.RULE 9. WILE E BIDEN IS ALWAYS MORE HUMILIATED THAN HARMED BY HIS FAILURES.Dr. Slim: “LET THE SERIES BEGIN!”Dirty: “Yo Dr. Dude. Move over Leo Tolstoy.

This snow blizzard which has dumped a record 67 inches on most Texas cities and towns came from Guatemala.The blizzard called El Nino’s Grandmama entered Texas from Guatemala by way of Mexico. Reporters from El Paso to Texarkana are all saying that the damn border wall did not work worth a damn.Leland T. Bumble a cattle rancher outside of San Antonio was out gathering up his stray cattle when he came upon what looked like an ice statue. As he got closer he saw that encased in about 55 pounds of ice was the ugliest-looking creature he had ever seen.Bumble said that when he got real close to it he noticed that this astonishingly grotesque creature looked like a cross between Ted “Count Dracula” Cruz and Marjorie “The Human Scarecrow” Taylor Greene.Leland who has a degree in Horse Castration and another one in Cowboy Cuisine said that his four bloodhounds tried to bite the ice figurine but they didn’t even make a dent in it.The life-long rancher then called up the local game warden Francisco Tampico who drove out to his ranch El Rancho Sancho post-haste.After looking at the ice statue from eight different angles Tampico decided to load the ice figurine into his pick-up truck and take it to Solid State College in downtown San Antonio.Tampico said the ice creature will be examined by expert veterinarians who will take DNA samples to see if it is in fact the dreaded infamous La Chupacabra.Meanwhile recent sports reports that the 2024 Winter Olympics may be held in Texas have been greatly exaggerated.

Facebook Group Deleted,A Facebook Group created calling for a boycott of Facebook after it took the extraordinary step of banning users in Australia from accessing news in a row over paying for content has been deleted by Facebook.'Delete Facebook' 'Boycott Zuckerberg' and 'Facebook We Need To Talk' began trending on rival site Twitter today as fury at the move spread around the globe.Angry Facebook users created their own Facebook Group "Delete Facebook" which encouraged members to delete their Facebook accounts. At one point the group had over 80000 members but today the group is no more."It just shows you that Facebook is a monster" said one angry user "They deleted our 'Delete Facebook Group' without any warning!"A Facebook spokesman though countered by claiming that they did not delete the group."The owner of the group deleted his account therefore deleting the 'Delete Facebook Group'. If people want to form a group calling for the deletion of Facebook then for it to remain active they should not delete their Facebook accounts. We encourage free speech; therefore if you want to discuss deleting Facebook and create a 'Delete Facebook Group' please remember not to delete your Facebook account."Confused? So are we.

Punters entering their stores are offered a quick Covid-19 jab at discount prices and there are no invitations necessary.Porta-Cabins have been erected where recycled bottle machines once stood. They have been moved outside so the German giants can make even more money.Punters who pay a £500 charge are whipped into the cabins after dumping their empty plastic bottles outside given a quick jab and then ushered into the supermarket where they can continue their shop!Aldi and Lidl are hoping to jab at least 5000 punters every day of all ages because they do not give a crap about who gets a jab first as long as they pay and OAP's in nursing homes do not shop in their markets anyway!The EU and GB are at last in solidarity over this latest discounter initiative! They are flogging vaccines at £150 a shot to the German giants. Meaning a win-win scenario because Aldi and Lidl earn £350 a jab and expensive vaccine centres are no longer necessary!However there is one slight 'spanner in the works'! Due to lack of space and the removal of bottle crunching machines in the supermarkets a huge mountain of plastic bottles is building up. However BOJO and Frau von der Leyen have a perfect solution up their crafty sleeves!All non-recycled Aldi and Lidl plastic bottles are being shipped to the Sahara Desert where gangs of African refugees captured by Libyan terrorist groups on their way to Europe are working for £010 pence an hour burying them in the sand! Hence killing two irritating birds with one foul swoop! Again a win-win scenario supported by BOJO Frau von der Leyen Aldi and Lidl in a post-Brexit-mega-EU/GB-trade deal!Rat-Pack leader Nigel Farage will oversee the 'Desert Rat' operation earning £250K a year. He will reside in a 6* star luxury container fully airconditioned Made in Germany plus a private French jet to fly in bucket loads of his favourite dish fresh Italian pasta!Every dark Covid-19 cloud has a silver lining!

Whete?"His wife was not born yesterday however and was not to be put off. She used her finger to indicate on her own face the position of the mark on his."Here" she said.He touched his face again then went to look in the mirror. Returning to the table he told her:"Oh it's nowt."His wife shot around the table to have a look for herself then sat back down again shaking her head in disgust.Kenwood reiterated:"Really it's nothing. I did it shaving."Then they finished eating their meal in silence.* Herpes Simplex is a viral infection only one of the causes of which is pushing one's face up against a vagina.

I was tinkering around changing some computer coding in order to try and weed out some of the less-funny material being submitted."But he immediately sensed something was amiss."Yes I immediately knew something was amiss" he said. "I went into one writer's stories and awarded 16 of his shite efforts 1-star ratings. On checking that writer's points total however I noticed it had shot up by 1600 points! Imagine my surprise!"The mistake has not yet been rectified meaning that for a few more days at least any writer whose material is 1-starred will benefit by 100 points for each story so dealt with.Said Mr. Lowton:"Yes that's right. It's just as you wrote it. Any writer whose material is 1-starred will benefit by 100 points for each story so dealt with. For a few more days at least."

"Listen it's a great tune. But we are all stuck here OK? We can't go back and we can't get into Europe. So we do actually have to live like refugees...and it sucks crap. Mr. Petty has no idea what he is talking about in my opinion. He is riding a nice tour bus around America some place. With plenty of toilet paper."Camp official Kurtmus Ingersoll said that they play the song as encouragement to get people's spirits up. And also because it's one of the few tapes they have at hand. "Our P.A. system is an old ghetto blaster with only the A side of the tape deck working right now. And that tape is stuck in there. It's my tape I brought it from Belguim. I don't want to break it. So we don't have a lot of options. If we play any of the other songs on that side people piss and moan about that too. "Even The Losers? Forget about it. If we try to play any ethnic local music on the radio we seem to always start a riot fire somewhere in the camp and 50 people lose their shelters. So we just keep playing Refugee.""I was beaten tied up and taken away" tells Melda Mericus. "I am sick of hearing that song. It gives me flashbacks and nightmares.""Yes I too. Kicked around some and held for ransom. I don't want to hear it anymore either. I can't sleep. I do have to live like a refugee" agreed a frail weeping woman wearing a hijab who wished to remain anonymous for fear of an inside hit job on her family for complaining about the radio music.Still others say that they have become very big fans of the song and it's having positive effects. We met Shzar Shavniz crawling out of a small tunnel near the back of the camp. "Shh we are digging a very small tunnel all the way to Europe! Don't tell anyone. Especially that weird little woman in the hijab" said Shzar. "Then soon we will be in America to see Tom Petty in live concert and play this song. That is what we all wish for most now. I'm sure a lot of other lovers been burned but we are gonna make it! You gotta feel to be true! That's catchy."Dig!!A 'Tom Petty live!' chant then broke out around Shzar who anxiously tried to quieten the crowd.We left Shzar and his crew of small digging children without telling them that A we are on an island so digging will be tricky. And B Tom Petty won't be doing any live shows on this planetary existence anytime soon. We just patted them on the back and offered them gum.And our own encouragement.Honey it don't make no difference to me everybody's had to fight to be free!
Thursday 18 February 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152410/texas-is-freezing,Texas Is Freezing,How can the citizens of the fuel capital of the nation be freezing? Yes there’s a storm of biblical proportions but Texas has always been regarded as the nation’s fuel capital.People in Texas are burning old clothes not fuel bringing barbecues inside to burn old clothes and warm homes burning furniture in those good old reliable fireplaces not just to preserve warm memories but to stay warm alive and survive.Hopefully Texas is experiencing what one day will be remembered as the last old freezing year of 2021. As though COVID-19 isn’t bad enough now Texas is hit with this freeze.It seems with several warnings to insulate The Grid after major storms the people in charge have ignored the advice. In defense of their incompetence (Isn’t incompetence Trump’s label?) the present Governor of Texas Greg Abbott is blaming THE GREEN NEW DEAL and renewable energy sources!How did he miss blaming Mexico for the freeze and saying Mexico is also sending their murderers and drug addicts who are adding to the freeze?It seems that AOC female (who should be home having babies cleaning the house and making meals for her husband) pointed out to the Governor that Texas runs on 80 to 90% fossil fuel and not renewable energy. House Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez also said the failure is not in renewable energy but in his leadership.Footnote: Iceland and Norway run 100% on renewable energy and it works year-round.

Trump is just bad history. And he receives a D mark for his performance in the White House. Maybe even an F for his failure to represent Democracy and attempting to overturn his failed reelection with his failed insurrection.No potshots at opponents during Biden’s Town Hall meetings on CNN hosted by Anderson Cooper. However he was asked whether he had heard from any of the former Presidents.Biden replied “All but one."No name needs to be mentioned. The one is sulking with the crocodiles in Florida calculating his next assault on the freedom of speech.Besides coming across as a fashion plate (trim and slim pin-stripe) during the Town Hall President Biden spoke with sincerity hope and honesty. There was a battle in his tone when addressing COVID-19 climate change minimum wage and Putin. Still he didn’t lapse into any personal vendetta about racism misogyny past opponents or future opponents. Any hint of self-aggrandizement was missing. Whew!But what a relief! After four years of muck Biden made a Town Hall a grand slam out of the ballpark event.Read more by this author:

Promises of being supplied with the advanced ACME ANTI-GRAVITY ANVIL WITH NUCLEAR COMPONENT convinced Wile E Biden that it would be worth his trouble.On the other hand the Trump Runner was very wary of this deal. For years he had been able to defy simple gravity MEEP-MEEPING his way to victory each time watching the conventional ACME ANVIL unerringly doing its Quasimodo switchback and dropping on the Wile E one’s noggin.Iran had been attempting to build this nuclear anti-gravity anvil for years. Flush with billions of cash furnished by Wile E Biden’s old boss Barack “Boom-Boom” Obama they were nearly there until the Trump Runner took over.Deep in their hidden underground processing facilities where the ACME CORPORATION secretly was assisting the Iranians in reaching their goal of fission grade uranium thousands of centrifuges were humming away; each one seeking the ultimate goal of providing Wile E Biden with an advantage over his arch enemy the Trump Runner.Would the Trump Runner continue his unbroken stream of victories over the hapless Wile E Biden?Only the Shadow knows what evil lurks in the heart of Wile E Biden....Stay tuned.Dr. Slim: “I will sitting on the edge of my BarcaLounger trying to stay awake.”Dirty: “Yo Dr. Dude.

So hot Cruz could defrost the grid and reconnect gas and electric power for the still frozen Texas community.“I wanted to be a good dad” he defended.Who can fault that? Certainly not his constituents. Mrs. Cruz even had an open text invitation for friends who might want to join Ted and her along with their children in Cancun at $350 a night at the Ritz-Carlton because “It’s freezing here in Texas.”Though the Cruz house had a fireplace they could have used more than 14 million other people in Texas were in desperate situations.So Senator Ted Cruz jumped ship left Texas and his responsibilities flying to Mexico the same place he was pushing to wall off for a stay at the Ritz-Carlton.Similar to the Italian cruise ship captain who jumped ship in a speedboat after his ship hit rocks and sank. At least the Captain did not claim he had to rush home to replace the babysitter. He was however sentenced to 16 years in jail for the resulting manslaughter.“I was just trying to be a good dad” defends Cruz. Also he says he was planning to work remotely from Cancun.Good idea! Way to go!Too bad freezing Texans couldn’t also remotely enjoy the warm weather running water electricity food mariachi music and a nice night or two in Cancun.First it was the Ritz-Carlton in Moscow now it's the Ritz-Carlton in Cancun.

Friday 19 February 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152426/man-defers-wank-for-another-time,Man Defers Wank For Another Time,A Fort Lauderdale man postponed a highly anticipated wank after realizing that he ran the risk of getting caught in the act by either his wife his daughter or the guy who 'does the garden'.The man whose identity cannot be revealed had planned on 'knocking one out' after taking the day off work. Unfortunately after spending the best part of the day searching the internet for adequate material to put in his 'wank bank' he simply ran out of time to actually masturbate."I am very specific; there are only certain images movies Facebook profile photos of people I know that actually get me in the mood. I kind of went down the internet rabbit hole and before I knew it it was already four o'clock. I toyed with the idea of maybe bashing one out but I was conscious of the fact that the guy who blows the leaves in our garden usually does so at around four coupled with the fact that the kids finish school and the wife could get home from work at the same time - I could not risk not hearing them due to the noise of the blower coming in the door or fumbling for their keys.

Friday 19 February 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/science-technology/152422/oceanic-scientists-discover-that-the-bermuda-triangle-is-really-a-trapezoid,Oceanic Scientists Discover That The Bermuda Triangle is Really a Trapezoid,MIAMI – (Satire News) – A group of oceanic scientists have just announced that the mysteriously mystical Bermuda Triangle is actually not a triangle but a trapezoid.Dr. Filbert R. Fibbingshire stated that the somewhat scary somewhat legendary Bermuda Triangle was first discovered in 1741 by the 16-year-old phenom Portuguese explorer Porto Marimba-Marimba.He found it by accident when Hurricane Miley wrecked his ship and he and his crew of 291 sailors where shipwrecked on the Caribbean island of Santa Claustrophobia.Marimba-Marimba’s men survived for 47 days and 46 nights by eating sand crabs palm tree bark and praying mantis.Dr. Fibbingshire noted that we now know that the Bermuda Triangle is actually the Bermuda Trapezoid due to graphic photographs that U.S astronauts Mr. and Mrs. Rusty P. Striesner recently took from 800 miles up in the spacecraft Americana Oh Susanna.There are some skeptics who say that the Bermuda Trapezoid (nee Bermuda Triangle) is merely a figment of the very imaginative imaginations of some silly individuals.Well like Dr. Fibbingshire has said tell that to the crew and passengers of the Siren of the Monogamous Mermaid of the Sea cruise ship which disappeared in 1959 the crew and passengers of JetBlue Flight 1313 which disappeared in 2013 and also to Mississippi native Riley Belltocker who just two weeks ago was riding his jetski from Buloxi Mississippi to Barcelona Spain and is still missing.

What if the girls wanted a Pina Colada?“Like a good dad I said sure.”He used the term chaperone his daughters to Cancun. Chaperone? Really? They look like sweet little girls but Ted Cruz makes them appear to be demanding little ladies running him ragged.“The girls wanted to move to Disneyland for the rest of the school year and like a good dad I said okay. In hindsight it may have been the wrong perception.”Or “The girls wanted fur coats and to start wearing high heels. Like a good dad I said okay!”So Texas welfare services are taking a second look. Just in case.The SPCA is also looking into the abandonment of the family dog Snowflake. Snowflake was left home alone like Macaulay Culkin looking forlornly out the window. Sure Snowflake already has a fur coat (no high heels) but did the Cruz family leave the dog with enough food and water or just a bathtub filled with pop tarts?“Well I wanted to take the dog but the girls said NO. So what’s a good dad to do?”Read more by this author:
Saturday 20 February 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/152433/a-second-helping-of-lamb-tagine,A Second Helping of Lamb Tagine,According to many experts if you are ever tempted to coprophagia or the eating of feces it is by far best to have first eaten a solid meal of the fragrant middle eastern dish called Lamb Tagine. This dish which I sampled recently myself is a stew-like concoction of tender lamb chunks slow cooked in a sauce sweetened with apricots and set off by the wonderful middle eastern accents of coriander saffron cardamom cloves and nutmeg. I can vouch for the fact that the amazing aromas survive the process of digestion and the excreted portion although slightly altered in form still has the remarkable power to stimulate one’s appetite the next day.Now you may be asking why anyone would want to even consider the prospect of eating a lamb tagine a second time however wonderful its aromas. And I confess that while mightily tempted I have not chosen to indulge the impulse to scoop up a handful. And yet in a powerful epiphany driven in part by the terrors of the recent power failures in Texas that left millions cold and hungry (and probably also by a dystopian film I watched the night before) I understood that in the event of imminent starvation one might readily choose a pre-digested lamb tagine over let’s say butchering and eating nearby children. Or—another thought--in the event that you are being tortured in some Taliban or Al-Qaeda cell and forced to eat your own infidel waste you you could do so happily—suppressing a sly smile—if only you had a prior meal of lamb tagine.Of course there are other ways to practice coprophagia. For example one can read the New York Times or watch CNN. Experts advise against doing both at the same time as this is certain to induce a worrying logorrhea which would have to be drunk rather than chewed. I suppose some might object that these are metaphorical examples of coprophagia but no. The bad taste in the mouth that inevitably follows exposure to Don Lemon is quite real and in no way measures up to the pleasures of a previously eaten lamb tagine.Listening to Nancy Pelosi speak is also often compared to coprophagia but those who say so go too far. For her speech to qualify her words would have had to have been understood and digested at least once by someone preferably Nancy herself. But they pass if I may extend the metaphor through her system undigested like the new synthetic fats that let people eat potato chips without weight gain. When Pelosi speaks words are emitted without ever having been modified by any biological process like the waste pellets excreted by a child’s realistic doll.Looked at philosophically the near perfect circularity of coprophagia is its most satisfying quality and one that lets us touch the eternal and the infinite in our daily lives. We are what we eat and we eat what we are. It is only this coprophagic sensibility that allows us to glimpse the deep nearly inexpressible lode of truth within a fine dish of lamb tagine.So eat and enjoy! And remember to flush CNN.

He frowned again harder this time. Contorting himself a grimacing Kenwood applied reverse pressure to his ringpiece.Now bent double the hapless wannashit writhed in agony as he struggled to keep the cack inside his cackpipe. And finally after ten minutes during which only brushing their hair had taken place the two bathroom-hoggers appeared looking like they had never heard of the word 'urgent'.And not a moment too soon!Like the Batmobile thrusting out of the Batcave the dirty brown trout emerged from his arsehole and splashed down into the muddy bowl.Later he said:"I was worried that I was going to have to dump it on the floor!"

We've made a complete hash of this planet - why should we go doing the same thing to Mars Ars Venus Penus or Youranus? Leave them alone I say! They've done nothing to us."And whilst there are countless problems here on Earth yet to be solved such as poverty food shortages the vast inequality between rich and poor children's issues debt war and climate change investigating whether plants could be grown on Mars' surface seem almost irrelevant he said.NASA's budget for 2021 is $23.3 billion.

She said she first discovered it a week ago when she and her live-in boyfriend Dilbert Mackle 19 were engaging in some hot-and-heavy carnalistic knowledge.Skeggy said that halfway into the sex act her muffin started yodeling. Her boyfriend immediately stopped the boom-booming session and just sat and listened attentively.Lea Jo commented that the yodeling actually brought tears to Dilbert’s eyes as he recalled watching movies starring Roy Rogers who was known as the King of the Yodeling Cowboys with his grandpa.She remarked that she had never heard of Roy Rogers but mentioned that she had heard of Clint Eastwood the Trumpapalooza Ass Kickin’ Band and Dolly Parton.Dilbert immediately called up his mother and told her about his girlfriend’s new-found beaver yodeling talent. At first she was a bit skeptical but soon suggested that he sign her up to appear on America’s Got Talent.As of press time Lea Jo and Dilbert are still awaiting word from AGT.

Musk said they will turn Bezos-Musk Inc. into a newer version of Amazon and are already planning on building 500000 sq ft. mammoth warehouses in Osaka Japan and Green Ice Greenland.He added that their short term goal is to put the U.S. Post Office out of business as well as FedEx UPS GrubHub and eHorny.WOW.One of the pet projects of BMI will be to corner the Glow-in-the-Dark Condom industry as well as to purchase the Snow White Diamond Nipple Ring Company and distribute nipple rings worldwide.Bezos chimed in saying BMI is currently in the process of purchasing 85 oil-producing wells located in East Texas and West Louisiana so that the U.S. will not have to rely on extremely expensive overseas oil.Both men noted President Biden will be able to tell all of the foreign oil producing Arabian countries to keep their effen oil and feed it to their camels.The two gazillionaires are now looking into purchasing the entire state of Rhode Island to use as an east coast distribution center.

The frustration must be enormous to think that after all those minutes and seconds putting together some of the most humorless gubbins ever to make it onto the page in the English language some arsehole like Kenwood - who is handsomely paid for his services - just sits there not approving the 'unapprovable'. It really gets my goat!"Unhatched suggested that from now on the editor anticipate what the site's writers intend to write write it correct it and publish it before those artists have even got out of bed."Just bloody well get on with it!" she said.Spoof boss Mark Lowton thinks it's a great idea. He said:"Eh?"* Thanks to DW for the idea
Sunday 21 February 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/uk/152442/able-rodriguez-wins-nobel-prize-in-literature,Able Rodriguez wins Nobel Prize in Literature,STOCKHOLM (World News) - American writer Able Rodriguez won the 2021 Nobel Prize in Literature for works exploring comedy in spoof writing an "unmistakable...voice that with intelligent perception makes humor universal" the Swedish Academy said on Friday.Academy Secretary Jacob Manchester said that Rodriguez also a multiple winner of U.S. literary awards and top writer at the Spoof.com  was "surprised and happy" at the news when it came in the early morning hours U.S. time.An avant literary genius Rodriguez first rose to critical acclaim in the sports world with his spoof story entitled " The New York Yankees Sign a 17-Year-Old Pitcher Who Can Throw 107 MPH" and went on to become the most celebrated writer and comedian in contemporary America.The Swedish Academy said that in Rodriguez's works "the self listens for what is funny of dreams and delusions and nobody can be harder than he in confronting the reality of the hilarious".Drawing comparisons with other authors the Academy said Rodriguez resembled 16th-century English playwright William Shakespeare in his "severity and unwillingness to accept simple tenets of faith by walking a road others can't see."While describing his work as "engaged by the errancies and shifting conditions of life" the Academy said Rodriguez was "also a writer of radical change and rebirth where the leap forward is made from a deep sense of motivation."Rodriguez becomes the first person to win the literary world's most prestigious distinction in writing since the Nobel prizes were launched more than a century ago.While he draws on his own experiences in literature Rodriguez explores universal themes that resonate with readers in the United States and abroad.Erica McAlpine associate professor of English at Britain's Oxford University said Rodriguez "has managed to feel urgently contemporary and yet simultaneously timeless humor."
Sunday 21 February 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152441/the-condemned-no-longer-fear-the-reaper,The Condemned No Longer Fear The Reaper,A U.S. government think tank has concluded convicted criminals no longer sufficiently fear the reaper and have come up with a novel idea to ensure there are no more botched executions like the ones occurring in recent years. The U.S. has traveled a long and winding road to find alternatives after a shortage of execution drugs created by European drug manufacturers banging their opposition to capital punishment like a cowbell.Thus far states have been unsuccessful in finding suitable alternatives as exemplified by West Virginia’s “meth gun powder and white lightening” concoction that just seems to make the condemned more hostile.“It’s fair to say that those are drugs that would not expeditiously achieve (death)” said Daniel Nyhan a professor and former interim director of the anesthesiology department at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.Thus far the American drug manufacturers have failed to step up to the grim plate and reap the market with their own effective brands of fatal execution cocktails. “There’s just not enough market share to research this particular consumer segment. Not until you start executing a hell of a lot more people” said a Big Pharma rep who declined to be identified.Botched executions in Oklahoma and Ohio in recent years have added tension to an already volatile situation resulting in desperate execution methodologies including tying the condemned to the rail road tracks. But the governmental REAPER Project (Righteous Executions Are Purely Evil Rituals) has uncovered what they claim is a foolproof manner of ensuring executions are as certain as death and taxes.REAPER’s final destination was an Office of Inspector General for Health and Human Services study initiated in 2010 that determined bad hospital care contributed to the deaths of 180000 patients in Medicare alone in a given year. After pausing and reflecting REAPER scientists made a bold suggestion.“We conclude that 180000 is too low a number. We estimate between 210000 and 440000 patients each year who go to the hospital for care encounter some type of f*ck up that contributes to their death” says Dr. Gunter Chang lead scientist of the REAPER Project. “This makes medical errors the third-leading cause of death in America behind heart disease and cancer. Unfortunately we can’t give the condemned cancer. It’s allegedly illegal. So I propose we toss their condemned asses into the hospital. They’ll be dead in no time. Our time has come!"There is a bit of irony noting that medical doctors are more efficient killing machines than executioners. “Gone are the good ole days when a family could have a nice picnic and watch a man hang” said Leroi Earp self-professed great-great nephew of the famed Wyatt Earp. “We’re losing our cultural heritage to schmucks in smocks! Here but now it's gone.”Some doctors bemoan replacing the Hippocratic Oath and "turn your head and cough" with "turn your head and die". You still get that thumb in the butt though. Others in the medical community have embraced their new role as executioner...as long as the condemned have insurance. “Providing execution services is a market expansion for us. Screw professional executioners. We have become as they are” said Dr. Buck Dharma newly named Director of Death Services. "Baby I'm your man!" he told reporters. "As long as we have 40000 new clients coming everyday we can make a profit!”

Waterwood one of the best tattoo artists in the deep south told GOP Gushings reporter Jimbo Zoopy that most of the women are members of the ex-president's highly-devoted base but added they just don't like wearing tattoos of losers.When asked what the cost of having a tattoo lasered off was Waterwood said that it really depended on the location. He stated that tattoos on arms legs and necks can be removed for $235.He explained that tramp-stamp tattoos will cost $395 and that tattoos located on breasts bikini lines asses and both labias range from $875 to $990.Alabama’s premier tattooist said that one lady came into his tattoo parlor last week and told him she wanted to have her “I Love Trump” tat removed from her right ovary.He shook his head and told her that he’s a tattoo artist not a friggin gynecologist.Waterwood added that he removed a Trump tattoo from the tongue of a Wyoming woman who weighed 395 pounds.He said that he had to charge her $1265 due to her 140-decibel ear-piercing screams biting him on his ring finger and for kicking him in his Waterwood family jewels.Meanwhile Marjorie Taylor Greene Hope Hicks Sean Hannity and Rudy Giuliani have all said they have no plans of getting their "I Love Trump" tattoos removed.

Cruz couldn't even convince a few Congressmen to overturn the election".Cruz's wife Heidi seemed to support the idea. "Ted's doing a great job handing out water and the girls could use the experience for their Civics classes."

According to the magazine the Senator's mittens "happen to be in the top 1% of mittens ever created." The magazine later suggested that Bernie's mittens be cut up and redistributed to all other mittens in an attempt to achieve fairness and equality in the classist mitten world. Senator Sanders is also reported to have considered breaking his award into over 300 million pieces and sending an equal piece to every American.In other news America has become such a dumpster fire that Senator Ted Cruz has fled to Mexico. The attack on the capitol Biden inauguration and the Texas snowpocalypse are all suggested to have played a part in the senator's decision to get him and his family to safety across the border. While critics are attacking the public servant's decision to leave the public to serve itself some Texas citizens don't blame Mr. Cruz. As one Texas resident put it "With Biden in office sending massive storms to exact revenge on Texas for voting for Trump I would move to Mexico too."

Our airline is a world class carrier and the image of a service that is in any way associated with nasal or throat mucus is one we would prefer not to be associated with."This isn't the first time there have been problems with similar-sounding names. Just last month Portuguese football player Pedro Neto and the German international discount supermarket chain Netto were in protracted discussions about a possible change of moniker for the Wolverhampton Wanderers striker.

One might possibly make an inductive leap that perhaps Wile E has taken too many ACME ANVIL hits to the head.A crack reporter from CNN asked if he could distinguish the difference between MEEP-MEEP and QUACK-QUACK?“That sounds like a trick question” responded the Wile E one with a crooked grin. “Can you rephrase the question as a multiple choice?”Dr. Slim: “I think it would be a mistake to over-estimate his ability to think.”Dirty: “Yo Dr. Dude.

Absolute drivel. Monumentally boring pieces of turd hardly worthy of being made into snippets cynically stretched out into rambling stories with no humor in them above what you might hear in a school playground. A primary school that is!"Meaner may be a moaner but others appear to feel the same.Several writers have voiced concerns that during the last year TheSpoof.com has gone from being a beautiful lush field of tall golden literary wheat to a Glastonbury-style quagmire with puddles of mud and piss where nothing would grow during the next 100 years.One Theobald Monk wrote:"(Deleted) has 42000 points.

Halfway through she forgot the words. She was told to start over and stopped at the exact same spot.She was asked by the trombone player to please exit the premises.Video porn store manager Simon Placentia of Bison Spit Montana sang the song next and started sneezing uncontrollably. He was quickly asked to leave the room because he had released thousands of germs towards the judges.Luke Bryan threw one of his Lone Ranger boots at him and Lionel Richie flung a bowl of grits at him. Katy crawled underneath the desk.Panfilo Guadalajara of Loose Woman Georgia then began to sing but the judges stopped him and asked him to please sing it in English.

The thing is Medvedev was playing his heart out and playing great tennis but nothing seemed to work.It started with a reasonable 7-5 score in the first set. But after that set everything went straight downhill. It was as though Djokovic was sitting in a chair easily returning winners to Medvedev who was scrambling left and right to the net back to the baseline hitting winners but every winner Medvedev hit was just not quite good enough.Sitting in his recliner Djokovic would return another super winner and win the point.At one time during the match Medvedev finally won a truly impossible magical point. God took pity. So amazed by the win Medvedev waved his arms asking the audience to join him in celebration.Sportsmanship! Beautiful! Not claiming the match was rigged or stolen.Not sending in Medvedev’s team friends and supporters in an attempt to overthrow the final match result. A win was a win and numbers are never disputed in a civilized world.Afterward during the trophy ceremony Medvedev graciously congratulated the winner mentioning that years ago when he Medvedev was ranked 500th in world tennis and Djokovic was Number 1 Medvedev said he didn’t think Djokovic would even speak to him. But Djokovic did speak to him and asked many questions treating him as an equal.Djokovic congratulated Medvedev in return predicted future grand slam wins “But not just yet.”All this with COVID-19 still an enormous threat but sportsmanship and humanity still thank you god still reigns supreme in Australia and tennis.Read more by this author:

But Joe Biden has two both German Shepherds that were adopted by him before he moved in.There have been countless variations of the story about a dog with two assholes. Never as far as has been chronicled and with dogs having been domesticated sometime between 27000 and 40000 years ago has there been a story about two dogs with four assholes both of whom happen to have as their master the most powerful man on the face of the Earth.And to add another element to the story a curious mind might wonder if one of the dogs had three assholes and the other just one.It was on page one this morning a picture of the President with his two dogs Champ and Major in the Oval Office. Also in the picture were Nancy Poozleosi Chuck Schumer and Adam Schiff. It was a photo op of course. President Biden was memorializing a new shipment of two billion dollars to Iran so that they could buy more centrifuges to reach their goal of nuclear bomb grade uranium before Trump comes back in 2024.The first to check on the meeting was Press Secretary Jen Psaki. She poked her head into the Oval Office walked over to the dogs looked under their respective tails and walked out shaking her red head.Then a couple of minutes later Ron Klain Biden’s Chief of Staff stepped into the office. After greeting the President Nancy Poozleosi Schumer and Schiff in that order he casually sauntered over to the mutts patted them on their heads checked under their tails and with a understanding wink he left the office chuckling.The President was befuddled which was not unusual. He called Jen Psaki back into the office:“What the heck is going on? Why did you guys check under Champ’s and Major’s tails?Psaki had a wry grin on her face. “We heard there were two dogs in the Oval Office with four assholes.”Dr. Slim: “I hope he gets another dog so we can do this all over again with six assholes.”Dirty: “Yo Dr. Dude. With so many assholes in the White House this could go on ad infinitum.”

The plan is to ease restrictions in stages to minimise the chances of the coronavirus spreading out of control yet again.The PM's fingers are clearly visible in the plans. In phase one married men will be free to visit their mistresses and married women free to have affairs. Apart from that the full lockdown will remain.In phase two businesses run by friends of cabinet ministers will be allowed to open. Businesses who have paid a suitable bribe to the government will be considered as well.In phase three pubs rugby clubs and fee-paying schools will open while restaurants selling foreign food public parks and state schools will remain closed.Finally at the end of June everything will be opened again and the PM has announced a parade and a national holiday to celebrate his great victory in leading the country out of the crippling virus.In Scotland a similar plan will be followed but with each phase following two weeks after England in order for the parliament in Edinburgh to claim moral superiority.

Ms. Thunberg who should be in school right now told Senator Cruz who shouldn't be in Cancun right now that the US is welcome to return to the agreement. With Ms. Thunberg's blessing the US can now rejoin the agreement knowing that the teenager who runs our world climate policy and is almost certainly not in school right now is behind them.In other news Gavin Newsom signed an executive order shutting down the recall effort. In a speech for the Newsom Administration a spokesperson called the decision "hard" and "unfortunate" but "necessary to protect the health of millions of Californians." According to a statement from the administration "the recall effort threatens the safety of every Californian. If Newsom is recalled many of the draconian measures protecting Californians will come to an end and people will inevitably die. Therefore it is necessary to protect the people by keeping Supreme Leader Newsom in office indefinitely." According to our sources the 2022 Gubernatorial Election in California has also been closed out of vigilance for public health.

As of today they wish to be termed 'they' and 'them' which of course makes little difference to Pelosi and co. since they always saw it as 'us and them' anyhow. It does however make it more difficult for people wishing to storm the capitol. Cries of "Where are they?" will then have little meaning.Instead of the macho approach yoga sessions have been initiated in coffee breaks at the building where only Republicans may attend. In fact Ted Cruz and his side-kick Lindsey Graham offer the 'One Taste' method of 'Oming' or orgasmic meditation where female senators remove their clothes from their hips downwards and relax on cushions. Their coochies are then gently massaged by other senators until they reach well orgasm. This refreshes them for the upcoming session."It's a win-win situation" explained Cruz while 'caressing' Deb Fischer of Nebraska to his left before turning his thumb and palm to the needs of Wyoming senator Cynthia Lummis. "You get to appreciate your colleagues from a whole different angle.""Whoa you gotta be careful these days" sighed a shocked Mitch McConnell "but you have to go with the flow. I don't participate in this 'stroking' thing bit rusty on that front but I'm not gonna argue with pronouns and nonbinary sure sounds better than genderqueer. I only hope they or the other ones don't confuse us or them with those...or them...or her...or whatever...hell I'm gonna have to practice this with my wife. Far as I know she's still binary."There's now been a massive influx of members to the party helped by the promise of such orgasmic meditation being conducted prior to each GOP rally.

Ouch!After denying paying hush money to porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy bunny Karen McDougal days before the 2016 election Michael Cohen was convicted of perjury and sent to jail.Cohen perjured himself to protect Trump. Spent time in jail for Trump. But was never pardoned by Donald Trump for committing perjury to protect him.Hence the relished prediction of jail time for Donald Trump and the suggestion of the custom-made orange jump-suit. Ole!A true reversal of fortune. How many lawyers even horrible lawyers end up going to jail while their client goes scot-free resumes his good life with free room and board servants in the lap of luxury at the White House and gets to fly all around the world with Air Force One at his disposal?All this while Michael Cohen sat languishing in jail wearing his orange jumpsuit.On the morning of February 22 2021 the US Supreme Court decided that the Manhattan District Attorney could have all of Donald Trump’s financial tax records.WHAT? Stop the world. Trump wants to get off.Trump is said to be stunned. He's described as walking into tables and lamps questioning how this could happen particularly after he hand-picked the majority on the Supreme Court! Was there no loyalty? What kind of justice was this? He gave them lifetime appointments high on the hog!Twenty years ago no one thought Bill Cosby would end up in jail.Maybe Trump could escape to Russia?Maybe Putin would not take his calls?Read more by this author:

Wear your masks for god's sake" preached Biden adding "And no sneak-up-from-behind shoulder rubs in the office fellas. C'mon. Use some common sense. Hair sniffing gone. Foot rubs maybe... No gone. Right?""And let all those stumpy flagpoles out there across this great land be a reminder of all those we have lost ...because of you-know-who."Biden officials did seem confused by questions about whether flags would still have to be lowered by half of the new flagpole height. "We will get back to you on that one" was all press secretary Pantski would say.According to White House sources the Biden administration is also seriously looking into having the Washington Monument turned into a giant candle with the flame serving as a constant vigil for those who have fallen from Covid-19."Or maybe even cut the monument down halfway...what about that?" Joe was overheard saying by a staffer as he tottered off for an afternoon nap....Maybe that plan has a bit of ironing-out left.

However Donald Tump’s former attorney Michael Cohen predicted that Trump would be in jail and wearing an orange jumpsuit by 2024.Stargazing for both men is at opposite ends of the chart.Maybe Romney knows better but is sounding positive because he wishes to garner support from the Trump militia as Romney may desire to become the 2024 presidential nominee?Michael Cohen doesn’t have any interest in running for president. He’s basing his prediction of Trump’s future on his experience as Trump’s attorney. Metaphorically speaking Cohen knows where all the bodies are buried. Michael Cohen even went to jail helping to bury some of those bodies.Meanwhile Ted Cruz says “What about me? I’m a contender. People will forget about Cancun by 2024. I want to be the nominee.”Will his girls say it’s okay? Besides Ted Cruz is a Canadian. That’s as though Justin Trudeau were to decide to run for president of the United States. No can do.Josh Hawley the US Senator from Missouri is shaking his fist at Cruz insisting that he’ll be the new face of the Republican party in 2024. However Josh also shook his fist on January 6 giving support and inciting the Capitol's riot to overthrow the election. That might also land the haircut in jail.Joe Biden keeps steaming along.Read more by this author:

"We're not just striking for pride" roared union boss Lionel Richie. "We want better claw grooming services for our cats. We want mashed gnu at least twice a week and then there's also the lion hairdressing - that's the main thing."Ringmaster Geoff Hat said he was helpless to prevent the strike. "If we go against them we'll be thrown to the lions. Literally. We tried to have a whip-round to help but they've turned the tables on us - usually they just turn the chairs on us."In comparison the clowns at Hat's circus are barely scraping by. "We're so poor that we can't even afford to put the wheels back on the car" said star clown Boris Arseworthy. "It's beyond a joke."Fellow clown Bozo agreed. "Every time we try to start a union we get nervous about who should be the boss. The shoe just doesn't fit."He continued "We need to get back to the days of the militant clowns of the 1970s.

Why not 100% instead of some fraction thereof?”*Next the sound was thought to be sustained groaning not from above but below somewhere perhaps the crypts of Founding Fathers such as Thomas Jefferson and John Adams.Could it relate to the First Amendment--the right to speak critically versus automatic obedience to misfits and incompetents who happen to attain public office?Might questioning the OPN (Officially Preferred Narrative) on covid death numbers case accuracy who it mostly affects and doesn't affect have aroused idealists of 1776?But again this theory was dismissed because the dead can emit no sounds despite advances in cryonics and dead people voting.*Currently the sound seems to begin with a certain resonance suggesting the words muck duck snuck buck schmuck or even that legendary epithet FUCK.Followed by ewe blue screw new few or (with increasing support for this interpretation) YOU.Whether the sound is increasing is the next problem for Washington with the President Congress and Democratic Governors calling for an Emergency Conference.Perhaps the Republic needs a new STFU variation on The First Amendment as with—The First Amendment Form B:“Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble . . .[/]Unless:STFU Clause A:"the preferred narrative is being severely questioned"STFU Clause B:“. . . shouting fire in a crowded theater/national emergency/sedition and unpatriotism can be used to raise approval ratings with JQ Public."

His black SUV had rolled off the road possibly as a result of attempting to drive the vehicle with 'no hands' as he throttled his choad.Medical staff who attended the scene found Woods with his trousers around his ankles and sprawled out in the dirt. His smartphone which was found on the ground a few feet from Woods' outstretched hand was playing a porn video involving a Russian man two women and a goat.It's thought Mr. Woods may have been watching the sexy video footage in order to assist him in 'bashing one out' but this has yet to be confirmed.Senior member of the medical team Mark Myword said:"He'd really had a good go at it and it seems as if he might have become just a little bit too enthusiastic and lost control of the vehicle."Word from the hospital is that Woods is feeling well below par.

Trump is Pissed Off At Ted “Count Dracula” Cruz For Giving Republicans a Bad Name,PALM BEACH Florida – In a perfect example of the pot calling the kettle black reports coming out of the Plywood State say that the man who turned out to be a one-term president is furious at Senator Ted “I’m So Cold” Cruz.DJT told his BFF Sean Hannity that he would like to punch “Snowballs” Cruz in the face for giving every Republican a black eye.As everyone knows as soon as the Great Texas Snowstorm of 2021 hit Cruz gathered up his wife two little girls a neighbor and his lawyer and headed south to Cancun Mexico.The most-hated person in the senate left in such a hurry that he forgot to take his support dog his support goldfish and even his support ostrich “El Pajaro Birdy.”Cruz told Senator LIndsay "Sissy Britches" Graham that they were only going to stay in Cancun one day before flying over to Cozumel for one day and then heading south to Rio de Janeiro Brazil for a whole week.RumorLand News reports that there are currently countless numbers of petitions with over 9 million signatures demanding that Cruz resign his senatorship and immediately return to his home country of Guatemala.Cruz told his best friend Marjorie "The Human Scarecrow" Taylor Greene that it’ll snow on the sun before that happens.

Then he simply smiled once more and simply said:"Insert your own inane comments here."Then he simply took a bite out of a Big Mac that was in his pocket and simply sat down to think of some more simple-minded insults.

Noticeably off his meds he squinted at the teleprompter with his eyeballs barely able to peek through the slits that were formally as wide open as two piss holes in a snow bank.Looking more like a Chinese coolie than a president even the most casual observer must have noticed that he was having trouble trying to keep up with the teleprompter which was feeding him words like a farmer fattening a goose for foie gras.Despite lingering rumors that have been investigated by Snopes but hardly disproved the salacious story that he was seen having sex with three hookers while driving a forklift at 1:00 AM down the main street of Shanghai is hard for him to dodge.This among other things allegedly occurred while he was visiting China with his son Hunter who had flown there with his father on Air Force Two. At this time Biden was Vice-President and Hunter needed to raise some quick cash.Notably absent since Sleepy Joe became President is MSM interest in this story.Dr. Slim: “I wouldn’t be surprised if he might have left himself open for some major concessions when he talks to Xi Jinping.”Dirty: “Yo Dr. Dude.

Sort of like Beelzebub got really super ticked.The alarms went off in the nearby fire station; the trucks were deployed to the scene the doorman said “False alarm. Nothing to see here. Just Trump’s tax records.”The fire chief said “Got ya.”Governor Cuomo could see the smoke from Albany. “Holy Toledo! Is that blue-black smoke from Trump’s tax returns?

They may self-destruct spontaneously like in Mission Impossible."Donald Trump is still planning to address CPAC but Liz Cheney is insisting that he be excluded.Caramba that’s one good woman!Liz Cheney is like a breath of fresh air in the midst of Donald Trump’s fingers crossed pack your gun yes yes yes echo chamber.Cardinal Ryan O’Brian Cassidy doesn’t see any white smoke in Trump’s future. “This is the last scene of the final act of the Donald Trump fairy tale.”Or maybe the files might self-destruct.Read more by this author:

In these days of attacks on the US especially the Democratic Party one cannot be too trusting she has said to mainstream news sources.“If they think the US is going to bend over for the swab to be inserted two or three inches and gently rotated they have another think coming!”Accordingly Mr. Biden has been called on to do something about the “anal swab threat” which at this time is considered on the same level as the January 6 assault on the capitol if not on the entire United States.“Possibly Mr. Trump or Mr. Putin is behind this” Mr. Biden told CNN last night.“Remember the Steele dossier? We need to get someone like Mr. Comey investigating it right away!”“Rest assured I'm in conference with national leaders like Speaker Pelosi every day on getting these matters resolved.”“But can we call it Analgate?”“We will do surveys and consider further.”

His army training instincts kicked in and he immediately shot the bush before it shot him.The bush fell to the ground and he quickly rushed over and shot it two more times before hearing the bush yell out "Stop shooting dude it’s me Private Hakim Jalalabad!"A medic instantly pulled half a dozen branches as well as a falcon’s nest off the bush and ascertained that the bush was indeed Private Jalalabad.Luckily two of the three bullets hit the falcon's nest and were deflected but the third bullet hit Private Jalalabad right in the middle of his his belly button.Meanwhile Private Tarmac was arrested and will be spending 10 days in a military jail.Reports are that Private Jalalabad will recover but he may need to have a belly button transplant in two or three years.Mirage News is reporting that the practice of the Afghan army using bushes as camouflage has been immediately discontinued.

At first he just used her to play 1950’s songs by the Everly Brothers Fats Domino Chubby Checker Little Richard and Big Richard.Then for the sheer heck of it he began asking her what the temperature was in far off places like Oslo Norway and Lima Peru.Well one thing led to another and before long he found himself carrying on a one-sided affair with Alexa that eventually progressed to the 3rd base fantasy stage.Then one day when Alexa was having an overhaul and was out of commission he began conversing with Siri.He found Siri’s voice to be very feminine and very sultry and so he began carrying on a fantasy affair with her.So Dennis is now very confused because he told his mother Maxine who is 98 that he feels guilty for cheating on Alexa with Siri.His mom told him that he needs to get off the vodka quit using the recreational drugs and go to Amazon.com and buy himself one of those gorgeously sexy lifelike Japanese robot dolls.

Or they look like shorts.Remember Mexico? The nation downstairs? The same place sends all of their murderers rapists drug addicts drugs tacos enchiladas guacamole menudo tamales Selma Hayek burritos frijoles queso etc. Well they also made and sent the idol referred to as the golden statue of Donald Trump to CPAC.The idol is suspected to be a piñata. Usually a piñata is filled with candy and is cracked open at the end of the party. It’s rumored that instead of candy this piñata is filled with Donald Trump IOUs or “I owe you.”What does Donald Trump owe the nation?After ignoring the COVID-19 pandemic and slow to enact The Defense Protection Act Trump owes all those who died their relatives those who became ill their caregivers the first responders and everyone else still nervously waiting for a vaccine to be vaccinated much more than just a piece of candy or his vacuous bid for re-election.An IOU is an informal acknowledgment of debt. It doesn’t specify the terms of repayment but Donald Trump’s attempt at four more years in the White House is like trying to sell one really rotten burrito.Read more by this author:

Only in hospitals or doctor's waiting rooms is loud farting forbidden but silent-deadly ones are OK as long as one is not embarrassed and one's face doesn't turn red. However that cannot happen because other patients cannot see a red face behind the mask!g) Wanking or masturbating anywhere in the house at any time is now acceptable but not in public places because being locked up with only the missus or a boring ever-fattening alcoholic hubby to look at plus sex all day and night would cause any healthy male or female to have a quick toss when they feel like it!These are just a few anti-social human habits which were once frowned upon and have now become accepted as normal behaviour during the Covid-19 pandemic claim scientists.If readers of this rather rude and anti-social spoof desire the full list of once anti-social habits they can watch old episodes of the Young Ones. Also highly recommended by the medical/scientific fraternities to beat the 'lockdown boredom syndrome!'

They ignore it.Lying on your tax returns? The IRS will eventually get ya.No. The BIG LIE is the corrupt pursuit of power. Voter suppression is the point of the Republican BIG LIE.What? I can keep the hot nuts?The BIG LIE is about an attempt at voter suppression claiming that Joe Biden stole the election from Donald Trump the incompetent puff who allowed COVID-19 to kill 500000 US citizens and sicken over 29 million.Really? The same dope who suggested drinking Lysol and Clorox instead of wearing a mask had to have an election stolen from him? He should have been drummed out of the White House and have had his little tweeter taken away from him permanently.Not so fast. The BIG LIE is growing and spreading by Trump and his supporters who first surfaced January 6th by trying to overturn a legal election by storming the Capitol.Trump told them “We’ve got to fight for our country or we won’t have a country anymore.”So those wing-nuts marched down Pennsylvania Avenue and are still marching planning to retake the White House by threats of assassination or voter suppression: STOP MAIL-IN VOTING.Why would Republicans buy into that?The BIG LIE  They also believe in Santa Claus the Tooth Fairy Easter Bunny and Donald Trump.Hang onto your hot nuts.Read more by this author:
Monday 1 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/uk/152510/black-america-screams-for-justice,Black America Screams for Justice,LONDON (BN) — An independent tribunal in Britain aiming to establish whether the the US government’s alleged rights abuses against African Muslims in America constitute genocide is expected to hear dozens of witness testimonies when it holds its first public hearing in London in May.The US is being accused of violating international genocide laws against black African Muslims who engage in polygamy within America- polygamy creates the birth of black children."Its a deplorable act coming from racist America" says Geoffrey Nice.According to Article 2 of the 1948 United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide defines genocide as "any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy in whole or in part a national ethnical racial or religious group as such: deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group."Genocide is one of the greatest crimes under international law often called the "crime of crimes" after the Nuremburg Trials.The US Edmunds Act is also known as the US genocide act within the U.N. The Edmunds Anti-Polygamy Act of 1882 is a United States federal statute signed into law on March 23 1882 by president Chester A. Arthur declaring polygamy a felony in federal territories. The Edmunds Law itself is clear evidence of genocide intent against American black Muslim's engaged in polygamy since it affects them directly and doesn't exclude them from the international violation.In general both public and private individuals are punishable [ICTY Art. 7(2)]. Leaders can also be held accountable for the criminal actions of their subordinates if they knew or should have known about the actions and failed to prevent or punish them [ICTY Art. 7(3); Krstic ICTY Appellate Judgment § 140].Organizer Nick Khan said Thursday an eight-member panel that will act as a jury has been finalized and that researchers for the tribunal were sifting through about 1500 documents and pieces of evidence submitted from different countries against the US.The tribunal which doesn’t have government backing will be chaired by prominent barrister Geoffrey Nice who previously led the prosecution of ex-Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and worked with the International Criminal Court.
Monday 1 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/sport/152509/when-is-a-hand-not-a-hand-ole-solskjaer-questioned,When is a 'Hand' not a 'Hand?' Ole Solskjaer questioned!,(NOT EDITED) The definition of a hand not being in a natural position during a game of footy is obviously quite difficult to determine according to footy referees and their VAR assistants.Manchester United's Norwegian manager has told English footy referees to "stuff themselves" if they cannot decide where a footy players hand should be in a penalty incident!According to Ole the hand should not be swinging in the air waving at the ball but should be firmly pressed to the body to avoid complications during a tussle for the ball anywhere on the pitch!Many modern footy players are 'tossers' anyway so maybe they should keep their hands in their shorts during play but that is physically impossible of course. In addition modern day superstars love to wave their hands in the air not at spectators there aint any but towards a loose ball not opponents balls like Vinny Jones used to do hoping the half-blind referee team do not spot their actions believing they are just correcting their £100000 nicker hairdo's.Old School Ole is losing his hair and wits at these rather pathetic decisions and told the Manchester Evening News a total bunch of journalistic 'Tossers' that in Norway footy players only wave their hands in the air when a passing moose trots across the pitch disrupting play and not in the penalty area during a tussle. Plus the fact it's too cold in Norway to wave hands in the air.The English Premier League are studying where the hands of players are supposed to be in the penalty area to correct such diabolical confusing decision making. After watching Maradona do his 'Hand of God' trick over and over again which bamboozled the whole footy world without VAR they have decided that players hands in the penalty area are only allowed in their shorts!Modern 'Tosser' footy players like the decision because they're a soft bunch of wankers anyway! XL pockets are to be sown on to players shorts so no more discrepancies can occur. As soon as the ball flies into the box all players defenders and attackers must put their hands in their pockets and if a single hand is seen flying in the air either a freekick or a penalty will be given!Solskjaer is happy with the decision and apologises for calling modern-day referees and their VAR assistants a bunch of half-blind plonkers but still got fined £10000000 for daring to question a quite ridiculous decision!

Bonnie's state-of-the-art computer system conveys that the buttons taste like a cross between a fortune cookie and a Norwegian sardine.NASA scientists have not as yet ascertained if the venom from the Martian rattlesnakes is deadly.

Donald Trump! He was awarded the Greatest Loser Award for losing the most famous powerful and influential political office in the world.There was a standing ovation when his name was announced but Trump refused to go up on stage to receive the award. He was expecting something more positive.But Trump’s awards didn’t stop there. He also won the Biggest Whiner Award. He was teed-off because close runner-ups to Trump’s Whiner Award were Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Representative Louie Gohmert of Texas.If it had been Turkey’s President Tayyip Erdogan or Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu okay but to be in competition with those two was something else for Trump to whine about. Again Trump would not go up on stage to receive his award but sulked in his seat hopeful of winning the Political Golden Globe for World-Class Leader.The Political Golden Globe for World-Class Female Leader went to Kamala Harris. Trump thought it should have gone to his mother. Hearing that for the first time in four years Melania’s eyes opened up as wide as oranges. Someone remarked that she seemed to shoot flames out of her mouth at Trump. Since his mother hadn’t won Trump said the awards were rigged and he was leaving. Melania nailed him back down to his seat with the five-inch heel of her Christian Louboutin shoe on his foot.The rest of the evening was uneventful. However when Joe Biden was awarded the Political Golden Globe for World-Class Leader Melania Trump stood and applauded keeping one firm heel down on top of Trump’s foot.Joe Biden River Danced down the aisle up onto the stage and to the microphone. Removing his Ray-Bans he said “Imagine all of this for Sleepy Joe.”Read more by this author:

He’s a little too handy. He likes the ladies particularly the younger ones or maybe it’s of all ages but he never paid money to a porn star and he didn’t have an affair with a Playboy Bunny weeks after his wife gave birth to a child.The hush money payer is regaled as the leader of the Republican Party. Republicans want him to run for President in 2024. Forget his: You can grab a woman by the pussy and get away with it because you're famous or the good Nazis the over 28 sexual misconduct complaints his incompetence ignoring the pandemic half a million dead over 5 million sick.“Do you ever date older men?”“Knock it off Governor. Stay in your space.”Cuomo was out of line. Not polite. Doubtful he'd want his daughters propositioned in the same way but is it time for him to resign? To call in the state Attorney General? How about Homeland Security?Just when the Southern District of New York finally after four years of trying got a hold of Trump’s financial and tax records. Boom! The Governor is in the headlines accused of being a salacious overbearing predator and must resign.“Knock it off Governor. Stay in your space.”Fox News grabbed Cuomo’s accusations like the Golden Goose. They will spin them as though the Texas freeze never happened (it was AOC’s fault anyway). Ted Cruz didn’t skip freezing Texas to catch the sun in Cancun COVID-19 was so yesterday and Donald Trump didn’t attempt an insurrection try to overthrow a legitimate election threaten the lives of House and Senate members as well as his Vice President but so what? There’s a Democrat in the crosshairs.“Knock it off Governor. Stay in your space.”Read more by this author:
Tuesday 2 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152520/local-man-accused-in-capital-riot-uses-mandela-defense,Local Man Accused in Capital Riot Uses Mandela Defense,A local man arrested for his part in the Capital Riot in January has pleaded not guilty today based on his being from “an alternate reality”. Gunter Chang a local philosophy professor and self-professed trans-dimensional diplomat clarified for the judge that he was NOT pleading insanity as first thought but simply an innocent victim of The Mandela Effect. Chang’s lawyer Peter Johnson delivered the plea with the characteristic cockiness he is known for and barely a hint of sarcasm.“The Mandela Effect is a concept in quantum physics implying that rather than a single timeline of events it is possible that alternate realities and universes exist and occasionally mix with our own time-line creating temporally anomalous bastards like Chang” explained Johnson. “This would result in groups of people having the same memories because the timeline has been altered but those people have shifted between these different realities.” Johnson went on to suggest that the time-line Mr. Chang originated in was “vastly different” than our current time-line where sanity actually exists. “They don’t even have The Flintstones and Curious George has a tail!” Johnson declared to reporters who gasped audibly.The term "Mandela Effect" was first used in 2009 by Fiona Broome apparently in some other reality following the death of Nelson Mandela in a South African prison in the 1980s. While Mandela did not die in this reality and in fact went on to become South Africa’s President the crazy-train notion that he did gained momentum and even picked up more passengers along the way. There was a lunch stop at Conspiracy Junction where they loaded up a few more fruit loops. They’re all apparently eating Oscar Meyer wieners due to alternate dimensional technicalities...or because they can’t just spell “Mayer” properly. “Despite a child repeatedly spelling the first and second name correctly in the jingle people are still just stupid” said one Mandela Effect doubter.Among the differences in reality on the other side of the Event Horizon include the legitimacy of QAnon itself. Other examples of this Dunwich Horror of a reality Chang claims to be a refugee from include events so subtle as to be imperceptible such as a Cabal of Satan-worshipping cannibalistic pedophiles running a global child sex-trafficking ring. Others are more apparent such as Trump’s day of reckoning known as the "Storm" when thousands of members of the cabal were arrested. (NOTE: In case many of you do not recall these events ever happening….MANDELA EFFECT!)Public reaction to Chang’s unique legal defense has had mixed reviews even among crazy people. “I think he reads too much Sutter Cane. They all do” said one local woman in a low voice before leaning in and whispering menacingly “Do you read Sutter Cane?” When informed there was no such author the woman immediately flew into a panic. “Egads I’m one of them!” she cried out. “Take me now Cthulhu!” So even the Lovecraftian crazy people think the Mandela Defense is pure bullshit.In a related story Grand Emperor Trump called for an immediate halt to all trans-dimensional immigration calling it a grave national as well as temporal threat. “We can’t have people popping in from all over reality willy-nilly” Emperor Trump said from The Coliseum. He then promised to build an interdimensional wall. A big beautiful wall...and have Joe Biden’s Reality pay for it.
Tuesday 2 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152523/local-scientist-and-teen-arrested-for-storming-the-capital,Local Scientist and Teen Arrested for Storming the Capital,An eccentric inventor and local teen were arrested after a high speed chase with police. Tire spikes finally stopped the DeLorean estimated to have been going in excess of 80 mph in a construction zoneMartin McFly 18 and Dr. Emmett ‘Doc’ Brown age unavailable were arrested after a short foot chase. The FBI became involved in the investigation after matching photos of Dr. Brown and McFly at the scene of the Capital Breech. Furthermore radiation was discovered to be leaking from what authorities are calling a “flux capacitor” in the back of the vehicle. Federal investigators are calling the device "suspicious".One CIA investigator who refused to be identified spoke candidly of Dr. Brown’s connections to the IRA and assorted right-wing organizations. "His computer and phone records show he has been in contact with QAnon and other fringe groups for some time” said Edward Snowden who once again declined to be identified. "And don't get me started on the Russian troll farms..." Snowden began before finally being pushed from the vehicle.“It is believed that these groups provided the plutonium Brown was planning to use to make a 'temporal locomotion device'” Snowden texted without prompting or elaboration. A subsequent search of Dr. Brown’s home revealed a sophisticated computer surveillance system and dozens of pirated Disney movies.“We don’t know what to think. This thing landed in our laps like an airplane engine” said Donnie Darko Director of Psi Ops. "If this crazy bastard was working on a time machine then we're up to our asses in a pocket universe bullshit! Meanwhile we're still chasing down that damned rabbit!”Acquaintances of McFly weren't particularly stunned by the news. “We always thought his relationship with Old Doc was kind of abnormal” said Biff McFly's guidance counselor. “But then again so are my repressed anger issues."Authorities are denying rumors that Doc Brown was a former NSA researcher involved in time travel research. “Like I said before while time travel might be useful in investigations it becomes problematic to get that information back to the future” said bio-terrorism investigator James Cole writing something furiously on his hand and promptly disappearing into thin air.Local police are calling some of the equipment discovered in Doc Brown’s laboratory 'meth making equipment’. After watching bags after bag of white powdery material being hauled away as evidence it became increasingly apparent why Doc Brown was so high strung all the time.Two friends of McFly’s Bill Preston and Ted Logan denied being friends of McFly's. "McFly was too much of a emo kid for me" said Ted. "One day he was all 'woke' and sh*t the next he was gonna fly to Washington and defend Donald Trump and the Constitution. Dude makes me tired..."“He was pretty uptight man. He just liked to sit around and bitch about politics” said Bill. "He could clear a room in one minute. That's the McFly Effect."Local District Attorney Sarah Conner has had recent threats on her life in connection to the arrests and turning them over to the FBI. She remains convinced of McFly's and Brown's guilt however. "What they did was participate in an Insurrection. They can’t be reasoned with. They don’t feel pity or remorse or fear. And they absolutely will not stop ever until Democracy is dead" she screamed at the camera.Local police are continuing to investigate if other locals played any part in the Insurrection. President Hillary Clinton called the attempted coup 'troublesome' and met with her Cabal to discuss plans moving forward. "Find Kamela Harris and bring me those ruby slippers!" she cackled.

Judge Lionel Richie said that her version was the best he’d ever heard.But the next day it was revealed that Bunny Jo was not 21-years-old like she’d said but was actually 56.Judge Luke Bryan said that he definitely wants to buy 3 gallons of water from the Squaw Face water tower.The third individual who got disqualified was the very attractive Stormy Vixowitz a resident of Corn Shuck Iowa who halfway through her song suddenly took off her clothes and started running around the judges' table hollering that she didn’t care about auditioning for American Idol she just wants to find herself a rich husband.Meanwhile Katy will be fine but her doctor told her that he wants her to lose about 20 more pounds of baby fat.

Fesstavelli III stated that at first residents of Frisco thought the vessel was the American destroyer the U.S.S. Marilyn Monroe which was on its way from San Diego to Kodiak Alaska to conduct some naval war games.But as the warship identified as the NKS Chim Chung Duck Soup got closer San Franciscans could clearly hear North Korean hip-hop music and even faintly smell the fragrance of Pyongyang Buckwheat Reconstituted Pasta Noodles permeating through the cool San Francisco air.A coastguard PT boat quickly headed towards the foreign warship and fired a warning shot over its port bow. The Korean vessel stopped dead in its tracks.The ships exchanged signal flags and the Korean captain informed the PT boat captain that they just wanted to come ashore and partake of some of Chinatown’s world-famous Chinese cuisine.After conversing for 12 minutes the ship was allowed to dock and the Korean crew were welcomed ashore.The foreign crew ate at the famous Madam Shanghai Ying Yang’s House of Rice. Afterwards they went souvenir shopping before re-boarding their ship and sailing off to North Korea.

Indeed it would be accurate to say that he would go a fair distance crawling over red-hot coals to avoid it. He knows however that in the capitalist society we live in nobody can survive very long without money obtained from somewhere and short of getting into crime work has thus far been his only option.He doesn't have to like it though. And he doesn't.He said:"Yes it's true. I don't like going to work and spending ten hours away from the people I love and in the company of people I don't. Indeed in several notable cases in the company of people who I would cross a road to avoid."And he added:"It's not unusual for me to have 'that Monday morning feeling'. I usually experience it five times every week."

Minus a decent personality and lacking any discernible redeeming qualities he somehow managed to be elected Governor of New York.Not of Ivy League material he graduated from Fordham University a mediocre Jesuit institution that requires only that you be baptized a Catholic and be of either Irish or Italian heritage to be accepted as a student.Adored by the liberal media for haphazardly weaning out over 13000 elderly citizens from New York’s nursing home facilities he nevertheless was singled out to receive an Emmy for his efforts to thin out the Earth’s population.A single man who some say resembles a 63 year-old baboon his penchant for ladies less than half his age was his downfall. Forgetting that diamonds are a girl’s best friend he thought he could sweep them off their feet without taping a thousand dollar bill to his forehead.Leading into a flirtatious conversation with a young sweetie by asking her if she has ever had sex with a geriatric usually doesn’t lead to a romp in the rack.Dr. Slim: “You never know. She might have had ramshackle ovaries and clapboard breasts.”Dirty: “Yo Dude. Don’t know how he missed. The guy has moves of a man twice his age.”

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis was second and South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem was third. Neither of the also rans had a statue at the convention though hurting their chances with the Trump cult.During his speech Trump reeled off a list of his enemies all members of the Republican party who have crossed him and informed all participants that the GOP was still his party strongly hinting that he would run again in 2024.

There was a shortage of ventilators and Jared Kushner was saving ventilators for his friends - just in case - and Governor Cuomo had to fly to Washington D.C. to wrestle more out of Trump’s grip.Governor Cuomo got the ventilators for New York and Trump complained that Cuomo never thanked him. Asked about Trump’s complaint during a press conference Cuomo said “Of course I thanked him. What does he want me to do send him flowers?”Sarcastic but to the point. Tough but behave yourself. And the warning: "Don't try to use me as tweeter fuel."Trump never made another complaint about Cuomo.So Cuomo is a flirt. Some men flirt until they hit the grave. And really who knows afterward? Right?Cuomo told a nurse dressed up in hospital gear gown mask gloves head cover apron stethoscope etc. “You do justice to that hospital gown.”Hold it right there: Code Blue call Gloria Steinem Ruth Bader Ginsburg etc. Cuomo is way out of line. North of Chicago.“An apology is not enough. The Governor must resign. He’s a man in a position of power and my goodness gracious even a leering smile and no words will intimidate women.”Ladies you wanted equality? Didn't you want into the big boys club? This is it.

The more Denver citizens smoke weed the more UFOs they ‘think’ they see up in the Colorado sky."He added that ever since some of the fast food restaurants started adding salt shakers filled with marijuana seeds to their condiment trays every eatery has increased in business by as much as sevenfold.One popular pizza place The Pizza Princess has even added three extra drive-thru windows and are now open 24/7.Meanwhile 87-year-old lifelong pot smoker and part-time Denver resident Willie Nelson told BuzzFuzz that he is planning on buying four marijuana stores in the downtown area.When asked Nelson replied that he personally sees an average of 8 UFOs a night most of them in the privacy of his own bedroom.

DeGeneres' young bird Lindsey Boylan was born with Persistent Genital Orgasmic Syndrome.Persistent Genital Orgasmic Syndrome is a genetic condition that keeps a woman aroused the entire day whilst having as many as 5000 orgasms.DeGeneres complains she's unable to bathe dress eat properly or use the toilet because Boylan keeps using her for stimulation. "Every time she sees me enter the living room she has an orgasm!" yells DeGeneres.DeGeneres argues that she sometimes wakes up in the morning and takes notice of Boylan sitting on her face."She's young and attractive but she's more than I can handle" complains DeGeneres.People hear 'orgasm' and they think it's a good thing" says DeGeneres. "Being on the edge of an orgasm 24 hours a day to the point where you can't let your partner sleep you can't let you partner function you can't even let your partner think straight – that's not fun." For many PGOS sufferers the urge to masturbate is overwhelming but Boylan explains that this can greatly intensify uncontrollable desires.Howard Stern called DeGeneres when hearing of her problem and suggested she get Boylan the Sybian masturbation saddle a device that helped control PGOS in a previous guest that Stern interviewed on his show.Elton John also recommends the machine to DeGeneres "The Sybian is fabulous. It cured me of constipation in no time."
Wednesday 3 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/uk/152518/man-cleared-of-theft-of-vegetables,Man Cleared Of Theft Of Vegetables,An alleged thief who has endured the ignominy of many years of accusations that he stole a quantity of vegetables has finally been cleared of the offence by a court in Peterborough.The falsely-accused man who would now be 227 went by the name of Peter Piper and was first blamed for the disappearance of 'a peck of pickled peppers' way back in 1813. Jurors were told however that there was no longer any evidence to support the scurrilous accusation and the judge ruled that people should desist from making it especially if they tend to slaver whilst doing so.Also nobody in the court could properly explain why the terms 'pick' and 'peck' were used instead of 'pinch' and 'pack' although this may have been because 'pick' and 'peck' were words that meant 'pinch' and 'pack' but which have fallen out of use since 1813.It was a very confusing case admitted the prosecution.The presiding judge the Rt. Honorable Justice Piers P. Pickles QC. summed-up by pronouncing:"Peter Piper is alleged to have pinched a pack of pickled peppers and a pack of pickled peppers Peter Piper may well have pinched. But if Peter Piper did indeed pinch that pack of pickled peppers where is it?"The defendant was cleared and the court dismissed.

Next scandal!?Not so fast! Does Governor Cuomo say he greets everyone with a kiss?Yes 100%! Very European! Particularly the air kiss one on each side. Enchanting! Right cheek first or nose collision?Do they have a film of Governor Cuomo giving a couple of smackers on Donald Trump at the White House?No reply.Instead of kissing everyone the Governor greets it would be a lot less alarming if Cuomo started doing the Punjabi Bhangra dance from India as seen on the Rachel Maddow MSNBC news program.Women would be absolutely captivated with that kind of Hello and they would not be tempted to speed dial their lawyers. Doubtful? Google the Punjabi Bhangra dance.The dance also looks like a great exercise not in the least bit sexist very happy and certainly Me Too appropriate. The only problem is the Punjabi Bhangra dance might require a great deal of flexibility. Maybe more than the Governor could flex.Would Cuomo take on a flex challenge? Bass fishing doesn't produce much flexibility.Tough love? Yes but in the future it's either the Punjabi Bhangra dance from India or just a nod and a handshake.So long greeting everyone with the kiss.But maybe one more time with Donald Trump.Read more by this author:

You'd think that at least one of the wolves would have raised the baby as its own. It's what wolves usually do" said wolf expert Dave Wolf.Parents of infants are now being advised not to abandon their offspring in woods populated by wolves despite the FACT that Romulus and Remus twins who were raised from infancy by a she-wolf who went on to found Rome* did 'pretty good all things considered.'Instead it is advised that more conventional methods be adopted for getting rid of unwanted newborns such as mailing them to Angelina Jolie or selling them on the black market to be used as glue**.*Google it.**Google it.

In fact there may well be lots of viruses out there. Bacteria too.”Many have bemoaned the fact that introverts have traditionally gotten the short end of the stick in the workplace losing out on promotions raises and overall professional recognition to their more extroverted colleagues. Halsey noted however that 2020 proved to be a year when many introverts truly came into their own.“We thrived" he emphasized in his email. "And when workplaces went fully remote for once we managed to be ahead of the curve in adaptability and embracing change."The IWIS president did acknowledge that continued lockdowns could pose a threat to the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the United States Constitution like freedom of worship and the right to peaceably assemble. "And that's unfortunate” Halsey stated in his email. “But the real key to happiness is having an rich internal world - and that's significantly boosted by not feeling pressured to make small talk in an elevator.”For this reason IWIS has pledged support for any and all measures put forth by Anthony Fauci that involve staying at home hiding one’s face and/or decreasing others’ expectation that one might speak out loud. “These have been tough times for some more than others” wrote Halsey. "Honestly right now we're pretty pumped to be part of the others."

Also websites have been infected forget your standard anti-virus software it won't work people are going to die" said the headline-grabbing attention-seeking sycophant."How many people will contract COVID? I don't know that. I am just trying to scare as many people as I can and of course bolster my profile."It has been reported that the President has ordered the immediate burning of all Whitehouse computers and has demanded that all telephones including mobiles be placed in secure lockers until 'Doctor' Fauci gives the all clear.

It went beyond our expectations. And most telling it showed us that a certain segment of Americans are more gullible than even we would ever have imagined.”“When Igor Flemski one of the head men of the Trump initiatives that we have been developing for decades now suggested the Q-Anon idea we laughed him out of the office. But he persisted and as a result we are all happy to have to wipe the egg off our faces; it worked beyond our wildest schemes. When we did put it into action we expected to get a rag tag collection of fools that we could manipulate which we got but in numbers we couldn't believe. But we never ever expected a full-blown attack on the very center of American pride and politics - the Capitol at Washington! That was indeed a Capitol plan of action! Our hackers have really done their jobs well!”“The first showing of buds that this might be a very exploitable way of interrupting and undermining the so-called and highly vaunted 'American Way Of Life' came when Pizza-gate erupted. That Mr. Flemski could convince the Americans; although they are the biggest saps outside of the common Chinese and the Muslim hordes; that a common pizza parlor hid a racket of child sex sales and cannibalism was beyond our grandest notions. It got to the point that some stooge actually armed himself to the teeth and raided the place all by himself.”“Now we have thousands of followers most of them so-called Christians who will follow blindly to the bowels of Hell a man who himself is without morals or high ideals no matter how many Commandments he breaks and how immoral he acts. This is a treasure trove for our section devoted to bringing down the U.S. by any means possible. Flemski has them believing that Trump is still in control of the government that he is still flying around in the Air Force One plane and that the military will overthrow Biden and make Trump president again. How does it get any better than that?”Voices cheer all around. “It cannot get any better!” yells one General. “The Americans are the ultimate dupes!” shrills a Putin-made billionaire. “The joke called Democracy is over!” hollers a crony newspaper owner. Then all together they raise their glasses and say ”Glory be to he real Q our glorious Vladimir Putin!”Putin smirks at this then says: “That is the best joke of it all! I am the real anonymous Q!”

Burntwhistle told the sports media that the tournament will be played in a bubble arena that has been constructed inside the Indianapolis Motor Speedway at a cost of $24 million.The bubble arena which is constructed of 1 part Dawn Dishwashing Soap and 7 parts hardened elastic was built by unemployed auto workers from Ford Chrysler and Kia.The arena floor was imported from Sweden and the hoop netting was sewn in New Zealand.Due to on-going fears of the Coronapalooza Virus only 45 fans will be allowed inside the pink-colored bubble. NCAA officials say that there will be a total of 27726 cardboard cut-out basketball fans including 12 cut-outs of neutral collegiate cheerleaders scattered throughout the sport's venue.The cheerleaders will have pre-recorded yells and dance routines coming from a speaker module that will be placed in the girl’s cutout pom-poms.The tournament’s first game will be played between the Lake Michigan Dribblin’ Dribblers and the Old Swamp College Parrots.The Las Vegas oddsmakers have Lake Michigan favored by 24 points due to 7 of the Old Swamp players coming down with a bad case of Bayou Gator Swamp Flu.The second game will be between the Hiawatha University Scalpers and the Left Coast College Red Rhinos. Most sports reporters say Left Coast College should win handily due to the fact that the Sippayenko triplets from Moscow Russia all stand 7-foot-6-inches tall and can shoot accurately from 50-feet away.The Quinnipinni Sports Poll has predicted that the final four teams will end up being Left Coast College Mojave Desert Tech Upper Utah and last year’s champion West Rhode Island.The NCAA has stated that hot dogs will be prohibited in the arena due to the widespread incidence of C-19 that occurred at this year’s Super Bowl.Quesadillas and fried woodchuck will be added to the menu along with Eggplant Margaritas.Reports are that some of the honored attendees will be President and Mrs. Joe Biden Super Bowl champ Tom Brady Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and 'Dancing With The Stars' Judge Bruno Tonioli.

At the same time Governor Cuomo a serial prevert with a record of talking dirty to young ladies who prefer to talk dirty to men their own age refuses to resign from his job.“If I offended anyone I truly and deeply apologize” the Governor repeated over and over again. Evidently no one is falling for his false contrition.He like Bubba Clinton was insensitive to the feelings of both his victims and the people who elected him. Clinton however had qualities that inspired poets to exult his failings.Although these limericks were not penned by Dr. Seuss - the author wishes to remain anonymous - might they also be banned by some pinch-mouth prude with painted lips and a heart filled with rancor?

Dec. 30 1773 Woof Blister with a SINful report for Spoof International News.Lord Acton chief of the Royal Bureau of Investigation today branded Sam Adams and the other members of the so-called Boston Tea Party as "domestic terrorists"."The December 16 atrocity in Boston Harbor was a criminal act perpetrated by radical militias inspired by the harangue of Sam Adams who urged them telling them to 'fight like Hell' and he would join them but he never showed up. They may call themselves 'Sons of Liberty" or "Patriots" but they are dangerous criminals."They hacked into our secure but defenseless ships using pickaxes to gain access to the cargo of tea dumping it into the harbor. This was a violation of the clean air and water law as well as a violation of the shippers' rights. We have reason to believe that Adams wants to take over the tea trade for himself sailing his leaky tubs that no one really wants to use."Lord Acton said the RBI has a list of 300 rioters who will soon be rounded up prosecuted and jailed or maybe sent to the gallows.
Thursday 4 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152535/studies-of-neanderthal-thinking-indicate-problems-of--fear-palsy--and-loose-bowels,Studies of neanderthal thinking indicate problems of “fear palsy” and loose bowels,President Biden's response to news that Texas and Mississippi will open their states to normal with no mask mandates has run into a problem.Biden stated that re-opening at this time is “neanderthal thinking” plus that it's “critical critical critical” to follow the science.On whether decisions by the governors of Texas and Mississippi are in effect a throwback to primitive non-scientific thinking as the President implied is under consideration.The question of just who is being primitive is currently raging on Twitter.Particularly important is that other states such as Florida Missouri and Arizona could follow suit. South Dakota has in effect been open throughout the past year.If states are opening as predicted recently because of the precipitous drop in cases and deaths a problem exists with vaccine marketing.Vaccines currently sell at approximately thirty dollars and higher a shot leaving the possibility these products could remain on the shelf if the fear-factor is not maintained.“Fear-marketing is in peril at this time” one anonymous Wall Street analyst has stated. “Hence the pressure on Biden.”Additionally neanderthal experts have stepped forward with cautionary views.Perhaps the analogy is not correct they say having spent years in studying dinosaur dung in various locales including the Washington D.C. area.Some dinosaur dung experts maintain the President's imagery may be more appropriate to Democratic response overall during the past year.A dinosaur could weigh as much as eighty tons leading to sizable deposits of dung which have been available for study to reveal their cerebral tendencies.Experts say that dinosaurs had a habit of over-worrying and spreading exaggerated notions throughout a herd.Along with trembling kneecaps (a “fear palsy” nearly paralyzing the animal) the usual amount of dung could be doubled (and loosened) given “over-reactions and hysterical responses” according to these experts.Hence something kindred to last year's run on toilet paper could occur in a dinosaur group although it is not yet known whether they used anything similar.The fluidity in their response could also be magnified within “dinosaur communities” when leadership devolved to the more aged and feeble of the species who might also be subject to “political influence” within that community.Looseness incoherence excessive wearing of masks might well have been characteristics of herd alarmism.Whether elites within a community of ancient beasts could profit from excessive amounts of fear-induced bowel movements is currently the subject of Phd studies at Harvard University.
Friday 5 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152557/jazz-musician-censured-for-having-fat-shaming-nickname,Jazz Musician Censured for Having Fat-Shaming Nickname,Jazz trombonist Leroy “Jelly Roll” Wickham has faced public censure for continuing to allow himself to be called by his allegedly fat-shaming nickname.“There’s no shame in eating sweets including jelly rolls and having a large-sized body” noted feminist influencer Katrina Martin whose several-thousand plus-sized YouTube followers heartily agreed. “It’s a choice that millions of Americans make and they shouldn’t be made to feel uncomfortable about that.”Wickham in turn has protested that his nickname was bestowed upon him by friends in good fun when he was only 17 years old as a result of his then-fondness for jelly rolls especially on Sunday mornings - and then happened to stick in the way that jelly rolls sometimes do.This argument held little sway however with larger-women’s-rights advocate Luella Hewitt of Charleston South Carolina who responded “We’re long past the time where anything can be done in good fun. Friendly banter is a remnant of a bygone era. Quite frankly Mr. Wickham needs to get with the times.”The final argument put forth by the six-foot-six 178-pound Wickham in defense of the nickname he’s held for over 60 years was that given his lanky frame his being known as “Jelly Roll” would likely if anything make larger-sized people feel more comfortable eating jelly rolls. “Honestly I haven’t eaten a jelly roll in decades" he said. “But from the looks of me people would probably think jelly rolls make you skinny. And they're making me feel ashamed of my own name!”But according to Luella Hewitt that's no excuse for maintaining an insensitive moniker. "I respect that change can be difficult especially when it comes to personal identify. But if your name is making someone else feel unsafe then you should feel ashamed of it.”Wickham expressed consternation at the prospect of suddenly demanding that his longtime cohorts stop calling him by the only name many of them have ever known him to have. “How can I control what my friends say and don’t say in private company? Between you and me ‘Jelly Roll’ is as clean as it gets.” He sighed and shook his head. “Sweet Jesus. Next they’ll be trying to censor Dr. Seuss.”

Rather than object to Biden’s label they might also consider whether Biden has hit on what it is that is leading to our dysfunctional government.First the history lesson. Of course the governors of Mississippi and Texas engage in Neanderthal thinking. They are after all part Neanderthal. That’s because there were a number of hominid species that have existed over the past half-million years or so and some of them including Homo Sapiens and Neanderthals interbred Accordingly most of us are part Neanderthal. If you are interested 23 and Me and similar sites can tell you how much of a Neanderthal you are.For a better retort to Biden the governors might use a strategy they learned in grade school. They might say something like: “So what Mr. President. You’re a bigger Neanderthal thinker.”Now for the suggested research project. There seems to be quite a bit of Neanderthal thinking in politics. Why is this? One might start to address this question by sequencing the DNA of all 535 members of Congress to determine if their percentage of Neanderthal DNA exceeds that of the average American. If so might that account for all the nonsense that comes out of Washington?

No more?Not so fast!“Texans are smart” said Governor Abbot. “We don’t need Government (meaning Biden) telling us to wear masks. We are a free and independent state.”Okay.The President of the United States skipped calling the Governor stupid instead went further and called the Governor’s thinking neanderthal.The nation can finally see the preverbal light at the end of the COVID tunnel with vaccine production and distribution social distancing and wearing masks.But the Governor of Texas who did such a great job letting Texas freeze blatantly announced “Don’t wear your masks. We don’t need the government telling us what to do.”Just a little dopey.So Biden called that neanderthal thinking. Governor Abbot was outraged. The Governor was spitting bullets.So what? Don’t want to wear masks? Place a quarantine on Texas. Keep Texans who won't wear masks in Texas. Stop the spread.Donald Trump was overheard asking “What’s a neanderthal?”Next he’s going to say “There are some good neanderthals.”Read more by this author:

Mr Potato Head was like a father figure to me a male role model. Now he's just like my genderless cross-dressing uncle who coincidentally also has a potato-shaped head."Piers Morgan ranted about the issue for two hours on his interminable TV show Good Morning Dickheads. “Mr Potato Head’s name change is literally tearing apart the fabric of society” he claimed.The Daily Stool was also foaming at the mouth. "Why won't these lunatics leave things alone?" It then went on to suggest that Meghan Markle was to blame for the change and demanded the chemical castration of Prince Harry.Sociologist and internet expert Geoff McCloud said the phenomenon was nothing new. "We had the same level of anger when Emmerdale Farm changed its name to Emmerdale. It was less visible because we didn't have social media amplifying everyone's grievances but for some people it was just as aggravating."He continued "People don't like change. It used to be that only tabloid newspapers could manufacture outrage on this scale but now almost anyone with a social media account can do it.""But really what kind of reputable news outlet would even report on something like this. There are so many more important news items you could be reporting on. This is just a distraction. Oh you're from TheSpoof?"

House and Senate members were made to wait barricaded behind doors fearing for their lives hiding from the invading Trump mob.Why the three-hour wait? Smells a little fishy?Not fishy to Donald Trump. People believe he finally gave the go-ahead after realizing Mike Pence and Nancy Pelosi were not located fast enough. No coup today!Earlier Trump preached to his mob to go and save the country. The election was stolen. Storm the Capitol. Fight for your country. Destroy the Electoral College votes. Make Trump the lawfully elected president."It's a trial by combat" announced Giuliani.Trump preached to his mob in front of the White House on January 6 but they weren't fast enough. Once inside the building they were overwhelmed by all the halls staircases paintings statues marble floors etc."Hang Mike Pence" they shouted.The Secret Service took quick action to hide the Vice President and Trump’s mob failed to locate him. However they did manage to build and erect the hangman’s scaffold. It must have been premade.Hang the Vice President use a bullet on third-in-line Nancy Pelosi claim the election stolen Trump remains president call in the military and declare the US temporarily under martial law.Yikes!But it took way too long for the mob to finish the plan.Three hours after the first frantic call for help from the National Guard Trump reluctantly allowed the National Guard to go in and clear the Capitol.He told his mob that "I love you and go home."Yes that fishy smell is coming from Florida where the crocodiles live.Read more by this author:

It's great to have a grown-up in the White House and not someone the world watches to see what juvenile act he may perform next. His keepers didn’t do a very good job and still aren't but at least now he’s out of La Casa Blanca.The government policy of separating children from their parents and placing them in cages was nothing short of criminal child abuse. Arrests should be made. Suggesting people drink Lysol and Clorox to ward off COVID-19 was ding-dong dumb.People around the world must still be doubled-over laughing or in disbelief. “He must have flunked every science class he’s ever taken.”He was not the smartest White House resident but because the MAGA people applauded and cheered him on he smugly smiled paused and drank in the applause forgetting they were MAGA people.Doing his schtick in front of a symphony audience in London would have produced silence. However it produced laughter when he addressed the United Nations. The tweets were bad enough but the name-calling like Pocahontas Crooked Crazy Lying Sleepy Low Energy Slippery etc. were out of line.Would George Washington require the use of name-calling to establish his authority? How does Abraham Lincoln’s Last full measure of devotion compare to Trump’s taunts?The four-year embarrassment is over. It’s a brand new day and a brand new Casa Blanca without Bogart Bergman or Claude Rains.Read more by this author:

They are also the first sausage-like product of any type to visit another world.The triumph is thanks to butcher Geoff Gristle of Chaffinch St Cock England who persuaded NASA to include the fatty treats. The meat-loving gastronaut had some difficulties getting them on board."I wrote an email to NASA years ago asking if I could put my faggots on board but they never replied. Then I sent 74 more and thankfully my pigheadedness paid off and I got a reply. Apparently faggots mean something else in America" he chortled. "But I'm just glad that my offal balls made it to Mars."The race has been surprisingly tight in recent years. In 2016 the European Space Agency attempted to land a salami on the red planet but it was incinerated on landing.Rocket scientist Werner von Bratwurst explained "The hardest part of landing a spacecraft is ensuring that the on-board sausages are cooked adequately. We will never survive long in space until we can master that."A Japanese spacecraft is due to land a fish sausage called a kamaboko on Mars in 2022 as well as the first karaoke machine to reach the deserted planet."The space race has come a long way since I smuggled a miniature hot dog onto the moon in my underwear" said retired astronaut Buzz Aldrin.
Saturday 6 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/152563/five-signs-that-your-karma-needs-a-makeover,Five Signs That Your Karma Needs a Makeover,Karma the law of moral causation was invented more than 2500 years ago in Northern India to answer troubling questions about the inequalities of life. People wanted to know for example why one person had separate houses for his family and his animals while another person shared his bed and sometimes his wife with a goat.When holy men tried to explain this inequality by saying "Shit happens" inquiring minds were not amused. When holy men tried to blame “systemic bias in the caste system” inquiring minds began to grow shirty. To keep the peace and people's shirts on holy men said "OK. You get what you deserve because of some wicked disgusting thing you did in a previous life or maybe in this one - or both. What goes around comes around. Get used to it."Thus was born the Law of Karma a perennial top performer in the your-fault your-whole-life insurance category. Because humanoids are a guilt-seeking as well as a pattern-seeking lot people immediately began to fret over the state of their karma wondering “what have I done to deserve this?”Indeed we have been trying to protect serve against karma ever since the holy men put the ball in our court. Within recent memory alone our fascination with karma has produced a television series about karma at least half-a-dozen songs with karma in the title (including the unforgettable "Karma Chameleon") a Karma food-finder app a Karma luxury electric car and countless tip jars with "karma" signs nearby guilt-tripping everyone.If what the holy men said about karma is true then whenever something shitty your way comes spare a thought for what you might have done to set it going around in the first place. To help you get started in this exercise we present five signs that your karma needs a makeover. The more of those signs that could be found on your front lawn the more you need to re-calibrate your behavior spruce up your curb appeal as realtors are wont to say.Herewith The Five:5.

Biden took off his aviator glasses and said “Look here Jack you and your fellow losers at Fox News had better get it through y’alls friggin heads that your King Donaldo has been dethroned.”He noted that of all the world's 196 countries the USA ranks 47th in the minimum wage department. He said that he wants to raise it to $75 so millions of poor people will now become middle class.Biden said he'd had you-know-who exiled to Florida and promised he'd fine him if he ever left the state without written permission.POTUS then added if the inciter-in-chief violated his directive he'd have him arrested shackled in chains and sent down to to Guantanemera Prison in Cuba.”CNN’s Jim Acosta remarked “Ahhh Mr. President it’s Guantanamo Prison sir.”“That’s what I said Jack. Guantanemera like the song.”And on that note the 46th president turned to the White House Press Corps and said “Take care Jacks and Jackettes and stay away from those gosh darn spreader beaches.”

Since Christmas however Burnley Brighton & Hove Albion Manchester City Everton and Chelsea have all taken three points from Liverpool and West Bromwich Albion went home with a creditable draw.German manager Jürgen Klopp has said he feels the stadium is jinxed and can't wait for it to be razed to the ground. He's also expressed concerns that 'ghosts of Liverpool's glorious past' haunt Anfield and have been giving him sleepless nights.Fans seem to support the move. One lifelong supporter Steven Wachh 19 said:"It's a very old stadium and the bogs reek of piss."Reports that Liverpool have asked to groundshare with Merseyside rivals Everton remain as yet unconfirmed.

World PETA Director Mungo Wagga told the sports media that the cruelty has finally stopped. He stated that he and his wife Nicole personally rescued close to 180 kangaroos; legally and illegally.Mrs. Wagga recalled seeing lots of adult females after the 7.5-mile grueling races literally with their pouch pockets turned-inside-out in the 88-plus Aussie heat.One sportswriter stated that one summer it got so hot that he actually saw 3 or 4 of the racing kangaroos jump on top of ostriches that were passing by so they could escape from the race.The government of Australia has commented that they are going to file a lawsuit against the world-wide PETA Organization.Meanwhile the Bravo Network information guru Andy Cohen told Sports Bet Gazette reporter Zorro La Bamba that PETA has a treasury fund in the amount of $1.8 billion; whereas the government of Australia only has $900000 in their national treasury.

This was the vendor.Kenwood asked the price and was told they were $12 around $5 more than he wanted to pay but the vendor told him to try them on anyway. When he did the vendor made a sound as if he had witnessed something miraculous then touched Kenwood on the arm and winked at him saying:"Very handsome! The girl the lady she like! She like!"Already withering under the graphic images flooding his brain the Englishman fought with his Yorkshire-born conscience which strictly regulates expenditure.But the vendor was insistent."Girl she like you!"Still Kenwood wasn't sure. He looked in the shop's cracked mirror and adjusted his stance several times taking in the view from all angles."Lady woman girl want to love handsome man! This shoe make you handsome! She not resist man wear yellow shoe!"Losing the struggle Kenwood fumbled around in his wallet for $10 a sum he felt sure the vendor would accept. The man grimaced and with a look of resignation folded the cash and put it in his picket. Kenwood made off.Counting his cash again later the vendor said:"That shoe normally go for six dollar! He stupid!"

No! No! No! No! No! No!"just like in 'The Planet of the Apes'.Zookeepers ran this way and that and could not explain this sudden increase in linguistic skill.One 'keeper said:"It was uncanny. They sounded like they were refusing their bananas but on another level it was almost as if they were throwing off their shackles and rejecting the accepted order of things."And Professor Taylor of Simian Studies at Charlton Heston University in New York state said:"These apes were normal until they'd been vaccinated but once they had they quickly started to develop skills not usually associated with their species such as speaking."One of the chimpanzees named Cornelius told his 'keeper:"Hey buddy! Stick those bananas up your ass!"And the apparent leader of the group an orangutan known as Zeus said:"The time has come to resist!"All the events in this story are true.

Millions of college students from all over the nation along with thousands from France Denmark and Pisagovia will be descending on the Plywood State like mosquitos squatting on top of Okefenokee Swamp.Merchants who sell beer suntan lotion condoms pizza Cheetos and penicillin are smiling from ear-to-ear.But according to one local Florida sheriff lurking just below the surface is the largest concentration of Coronapalooza germs in the entire solar system.Dr. Litwin W. Simpsonellico an ear-nose-and-throat doctor from Daytona Beach said that he personally took sand samples of one of the state’s largest and most popular beaches and found it to contain 6903 units of the dreaded C-19 per square inch of beach.He added that to put it in perspective that is enough COVID to literally stop a stampeding herd of 4000 Texas longhorn cattle dead in their tracks (no pun intended).The good doctor was asked what he would suggest to try to stop this potentially catastrophic situation that will soon hit Florida and other states with public beaches.Dr. Simpsonellico simply shook his head and said “Well for me that’s a very easy answer. My wife and I are going to stay self-isolated in our double-wide trailer in Oskaloosa Iowa thousands and thousands of miles from any friggin' beaches!”

Sniffin’ Joe Biden’s peculiar penchant for surreptitiously sneaking up behind unsuspecting chicks putting his lecherous mitts on their quaking shoulders and then doing a snorkel-less deep dive into the backside of their bee-hives made him a living legend on the Beltway.Because of her sharp tongue and spiky red hair in Mexico Press Secretary Jen Psaki would be called a  puerco espin cabeza roja  - a red-headed porcupine.Because the porcupine is the prickliest of rodents its Latin name means “quill pig.” There are more than two dozen porcupine species and all boast a coat of needle-like quills to give predators a sharp reminder that this animal is no easy meal.Alas. Sniffin’ Joe had no idea when the alarm in his codpiece radar signaled that Target Alpha was approaching and that it was armed to the quills. Circling around her so that he could come in from the rear undetected Psaki was caught completely off-guard when Sniffin’ Joe stuck his proboscis into her painted hairdo.Suddenly her natural instincts took over. Her hair turned into spikes and Joe’s nose was toast. It took two hours for the ER Surgeon at Walter Reed Hospital to remove the quills from his snozzle.Dr. Slim: “Is there a lesson to be learned here?”Dirty: “Yo Doctor Dude: Always wear your face mask and keep six feet away from porcupines.”

Until this week however Wilder had always believed that they could stage a miraculous run-in to clinch the title on the last day if necessary but last week's 0-2 home defeat by fellow strugglers Southampton finally brought the gritty gravel-throated Yorkshireman to his senses.With just ten games remaining the most they could amass is another 30 points which would leave them in sixth - but that's only if nobody currently below sixth scores another point.Wilder told fans on the club's website:Am sorry t'say we mite afta set'al f'summat less than champions this year. It looks like we can't catch Man City but we art givin up an w'ill give it another go next season. You can count on that!"One fan blamed United's poor performances on their often-worn change strip of pink shirts.Frank Steelehead 49 said:"I blame United's poor performances on their often-worn change strip of pink shirts."
Sunday 7 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/152569/national-unplug-it-then-plug-it-back-in-day,National Unplug It Then Plug It Back In Day,When we were in college the Cuban Missile crisis and the draft scared the bejesus out of Americans and inspired this joke: What do you do in case of fallout? Stick it back in and shorten the stroke.Much the same advice is proffered today by computer technicians: Have you tried unplugging it then plugging it back in again? This is always said without inflection…computer techs do not do irony and do not recognize any entendre beyond the single.The low-tech version of shortening the stroke works a treat with devices such as cable modems routers streaming television boxes and “smart” devices from cell phones to dildos all of which have tiny computers inside. Unplugging and re-plugging devices like these reboots their computers forcing them to flush any temporary software malfunctions.Although plug-out-plug-in often leaves the customer satisfied it doesn’t fix the problem that caused the cock-up to begin with; but that’s its brilliance. It puts off for a while having to do anything about the balky device…or even thinking about it.Often unplugging then re-plugging will buy a person months of time at the cost of a reboot now and again. My dominant half and I have been putting off getting a new Roku box for the better part of a year now using this technique.Sadly however as Mick Jagger has warned us “Everything turns to shit eventually.” A self-fulfilling prophecy that.Irregardless [sic] you will eventually be rebooting so often that you’ll realize the damn device is unplugging and re-plugging you. Then to add injury to insult one day the bastard just won’t work at all. There are loads of people - you can find them on the web (where else?) - who write to help sites complaining that their televisions will no longer work unless they’re unplugged and then re-plugged first.And that Gentle Reader is worse than a chronic case of fallout; but at least when you finally call tech support about the problem and you are asked if you tried unplugging it then re-plugging it you can proudly answer yes.At which point the tech person will say “Let me put you on hold while I talk to my superior.”
Sunday 7 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/uk/152566/farting-cat-farts-in-owners-face,Farting cat farts in owner's face!,(NOT EDITED) As most cat owners know cats can be quite obstinate naughty ignore their owners orders go their own way and do their own thing. In other words cats are completely opposite to their canine competitors.However one cat a huge Persian called Percy took these catty traits to a limit. It resides in a terraced house in Belvedere Kent UK. Percy is pampered day and night by its owner he sleeps where he wants to favourite place in owner's bed of course and always grabs prime position in front of the gas fire on very cold nights.Percy is fed only prime cut meat and expensive tin food plus an occasional tit-bit cream cakes but only on Sundays. Percy's nutritional diet as one can imagine has led to him being slightly overweight not quite obese but very near and combustible disruptions exiting his rear orifice.The owner a well to do granny from 79 first smelt the problem when Percy sitting on her lap and purring let several farts rip! The stench was awful and nearly made Granny puke! However she was convinced it was not her beloved Percy and ordered a team of Vermin-Terminators just in case there were dead river-rats or mice lying around the place. Belvedere is located near the Thames and local river-rats have been observed encroaching human habitats in the vicinity.The Terminator Team found nothing but on leaving the house spotted a rather corpulent Persian cat sitting on grannies lap. They offered some advice and advised her to get Percy's belly examined at the local vet.Distraught with anger and feeling totally insulted she told them to 'Fuck Off and catch some rats instead of insulting her precious Percy!" They charged her £5000 for the pleasure.Percy also feeling quite insulted turned his rear-end in the direction of the Terminator Team and released a huge fart which stunk incredibly awful.

Monday 8 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/entertainment-gossip/152582/forest-rangers-come-close-to-capturing-sasquatch-aka-big-foot,Forest Rangers Come Close to Capturing Sasquatch (aka Big Foot),(NOT EDITED) DIRTY RIVER Wyoming – (Satire News) – The United States Department of Forestry has just released newly gathered information about Sasquatch alias Big Foot.They noted that although he does walk upright like a normal human he does have a tendency to get down on all fours and crawl all over Yellowstone National Park like drunk college students.Recent observations show that Quatchy’s feet only measure 9 ½-D instead of 17-DD like most historians erroneously believe.Experts say that the reason for the discrepancy may be due to two facts; one he’s hunchbacked and two he’s pigeon-toed.Forest Rangers out on a bear-feeding mission say they came very close to capturing the elusive upright walking beast.Rangers Noah Lemonwater and Norm Pinca said that as they were making a fire to cook some squirrelburgers they saw the infamous Big Foot about 35 yards away.But before they could get out of their pajamas and go chase him he took off for the inner woods looking like Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliot carrying a football.Meanwhile the Ringling Brothers Barnum & Bailey Circus says their standing offer of $1 million to anyone who catches Sasquatch and delivers him to their circus headquarters in Florida is still on the table.Reports are that a group of Proud Boys have been searching all over Yellowstone National Park hoping to catch the so-called hairy monster.The rumor is that they plan to use the money to finance an assault on the Smithsonian Institute in Washington D.C. When asked why a spokesman for the group replied that they are currently working on finding a legitimate reason.Recent rumors that Sasquatch and Senator Ted Cruz are related have not been substantiated as of yet. Granted there certainly are tremendous similarities in certain features such as the head the eyes the nose the ears and the penis.In a non-related story. Vice-President Kamala Harris has told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that the rumor of her having signed a $3 million contract with Converse Tennis Shoes is totally false.

Both should resign from any present film productions?Skip across the Atlantic. If Robert Redford or Steven Spielberg invited you for a Starbucks snack would you call the FBI hold a press conference explain that you felt threatened by an older man's invitation?Cuomo asked “Would you consider dating an older man?”Which appears innocent enough and nowhere near Bill Cosby sneaking a quaalude then saying "Guess what? You're on a date."“But Governor Cuomo is in a position of power.”So is the AAA guy who comes over to change a flat tire.What if a flight Captain (a superposition of power) during a trans-Atlantic flight (even more super) strolling down the aisle saw someone special not wearing a wedding ring and she asks the guy passenger for a date? Should the guy passenger ask for a parachute and bailout?Not realistic?Okay on landing would it be more realistic for the guy passenger to report the Captain (who flew missions over Iraq) and say she should resign or be fired?Suppose Pope Francis invited you for espresso would you report him to God?Nailed it!If older men in positions of power asking ladies for dates makes those ladies feel threatened do as Nancy Reagan once recommended:"Just say no."Read more by this author:

Tuckytat 34 divulged to her therapist Dr. Ula Dizzler 51 that the bad thing is that half of the personalities hate the other half and are constantly at each other’s throats.Ms. Tuckytat says as a result she hasn’t been able to sleep in six days for fear of getting the hell beat out of her by one or more of her mean inner selves while she sleeps.She said that four days ago while she was having bottomless pancakes at an IHOP four of her personalities suddenly pounced on another and it turned into a free-for-all with pancakes molasses butter and peaches flying all over the eatery.She was taken down to the police station and booked for inciting a riot.Tuckytat was asked how her gender number breaks down. She remarked that 22 are male 19 are female and 1 is a hermaphrodite who is attracted to males females and elderly French Poodles.Tuckytat was recently fired from her job. Her manager said that she just got sick and tired of three of her personalities who are three of the meanest bitches and SOB’s that she has seen in 27 years in the food service industry.Meanwhile Vice-President Kamala Harris has been made aware of Tuckytat’s situation and is checking into possibly having her sent to a special home for multiple-personalitied individuals down in Tierra Del Fuego Argentina.

Monday 8 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152573/oklahoma-adopts-death-by-dumbo-execution-method,Oklahoma Adopts "Death By Dumbo" Execution Method,Following the inept forty-three minute execution of inmate Clayton Lockett in Oklahoma seven years ago the Oklahoma legislature has recently voted to replace the "dead in the water" lethal injection route with “Death by Dumbo”.Following the nationally embarrassing spectacle Oklahoma’s then governor Mary Fallin asked her Cabinet members to investigate the failed execution and issued a 60-day stay of execution for Charles Warner.They apparently concluded there was no failure in the protocol since Mr. Lockett was indeed dead...and executed Mr. Warner anyway after a fashionable delay.According to sources inside the flubbed execution medical technicians were unable to locate suitable veins for injection in Lockett’s neck arms or legs and had to resort to locating sites in the man’s groin. "No Happy Endings were had that day" an unidentified medical techinician involved in the execution noted.Warner was originally scheduled to have been the second execution in a rare double-header before Lockett’s gruesome death got real and harshed everyone’s picnic. Jubilations were short-lived however as Warner was subsequently executed by another inefficient drug substitution just nine months later. His last words were reportedly "Man it's still fu*ked up!" before jamming up the Death Row Express once again.In South Carolina it's been almost ten years since a good old-fashioned lethal injection. After the drugs ran out condemned inmates free to chose between lethal injection and the electric chair...always seemed to pick the method on back order. Finally in frustration Senators added firing squad to the electric chair as alternatives if the state can't execute condemned inmates by lethal injection. "Man that just fuc*ed everything up!" said one South Carolina Death Row inmate trying to game the System.Oklahoma doesn't use a firing squad since they'd probably just shoot the condemned in the balls anyway. And while they may be prohibited from hanging people anymore Oklahoma has nevertheless found a way to tighten up the execution process like a noose. Dumbo a rogue circus elephant convicted of killing his long time handler in the late 90’s is slated to become the state’s newest executioner. Dumbo was suggested as an alternative execution method after witnessing him lifting weights and idlely crushing pumpkins in the prison exercise yard.“He has a lot of anger issues after losing his mother" said one Department of Corrections employee. "A pumpkin is about the same size as a human head. We noticed he has a knack for skull cracking so what the hell?" he continued. Medical technicians applaud the new execution method citing feeling slightly “uncomfortable” handling a condemned man’s junk searching for a femoral artery.Dumbo is currently serving a life sentence yet continues to maintain his innocence according to authorities. "An elephant just can't get a fair trial in Oklahoma" Dumbo told reporters. Dumbo will be granted special privileges as a trustie however should he decide to accept the position of state executioner.Apparently Dumbo only narrowly beat out “Crazy Ted with a pillow” for executioner. Crazy Ted a notorious inmate noted for the mysterious "suicide" deaths of his cellmates by suffocation was considered too mundane a method of execution. “Dumbo can bring in the tourist traffic. Where’s the entertainment value in watching a psycho smother a man tied to a gurney with a pillow?” said one marketing consultant.Once executions start-up again Oklahoma plans to eliminate a considerable back-log. “We’re looking at a daily show at 6:00 a.m. with two shows on Saturday” said Oklahoma Governor Stitt. One unfortunate inmate scheduled to be among the first people executed by Dumbo early next month remarked to reporters “Man this is truly f*cked up!”

She added "Just a taste mind you; we don’t want anyone going off the deep end.”An example of “going off the deep end” might Dr. Wallace explained entail attending a place of worship and/or singing in a church choir without wearing a face mask. “Those things still need to be strictly curtailed. In fact we recommended double-masking when it involves any activity theoretically protected by the U.S. Constitution.”That being said Dr. Wallace expects the CDC announcement regarding the return of peaceable assembly to spark great rejoicing among Americans albeit in physically distanced groups of no more than six to eight (preferably fewer) people. “It’s a time of great celebration and the sky’s the limit” she said. “Masks will of course remain optional.”

However a truce seems unlikely as the 'Ginger Wolf' filled with hatred towards those whom he feels were responsible for the 'Paris Betrayal' and has already drawn first blood plots further vengeance against those he once called family.Watch the whole thing develop on HBO Sunday at 9 EST.

In the movie released in 1943 Roddy McDowell had to sell his beloved dog to the Duke of Rudling because his family could no longer afford to feed him.After the Duke takes the collie to his Scottish estate his granddaughter (Elizabeth Taylor) helps the dog escape. Facing great dangers on her lengthy journey home Lassie finally rejoins her beloved family.This is not the case with President Biden’s dogs Champ and Major. During a recent photo op in the Oval Office a big deal was made of the fact that the two German Shepherds had four assholes between them. They were pictured sitting on the floor with the President Nancy Poozleosi Chuck Schumer and Kamala Harris on either side of them.CNN reported that Champ and Major were being sent back to the Biden family home in Delaware. This is not a vacation for the dogs. It appears that Major had taken a bite out of someone he didn’t like in the White House earlier this week. It was revealed that the victim was so ugly that she had to tie a porkchop around her neck so that the dog would let her pet him.Alas. That morning she forgot her porkchop.Dr. Slim: “Why didn’t they send the four assholes home instead?”Dirty: Yo Doctor. Only their Proctologists can answer that.”
Tuesday 9 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/world/152526/man-nearly-shit-himself-during-journey-to-work,Man Nearly Shit Himself During Journey To Work,A man who was being conveyed by motorcycle to his place of employment by his nasty brainless not to mention lazy step-daughter this morning has said the youngster drove the vehicle so erratically and carelessly that several times he feared for his underpants.Moys Kenwood 57 had to endure the tortuous ride to work because his wife wasn't feeling up to things this morning and instructed her 17-year-old daughter Yasmi to 'do the honors'.But this clearly didn't sit well with the girl who finds it difficult to rise in the morning.Or the afternoon for that matter.Setting out like a bullet out of a gun she rode through every pothole she could possibly manage annoyed beyond belief that she'd had to put her smartphone down temporarily.Said Kenwood:"I'd started to think that phone was part of her left hand!"The pair hurtled along at breakneck speed weaving in and out of other traffic swinging madly from one side of the road to the other and causing other vehicle owners to tut.Several times they flirted with death.At one point Kenwood closed his eyes tightly and tried to think of 'something else'."I thought we were going to have a 'bum cigar' incident!" he confessed.Once he had arrived at work the Englishman was noticeably relieved but still had to visit the toilet in a hurry to empty his bowels.
Tuesday 9 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/152588/do-you-recall-your-first-sexual-experience,Do You Recall Your First Sexual Experience?,Most people can recall their first sexual experience but judging from the responses to the 2021 Postcards from the Pug Bus Sex Survey not everyone puts a smiley face on that memory. A total of 1167 people responded to the Pug Bus survey. This penetrating study the most authoritative of its kind since the Kinsey Report ripped the covers off startling facts about the first-time sexual experiences of typical Americans.Survey participants were asked to complete the following statement: "My first sexual experience was . . ." The choices which ranged from "awesome" to "illegal in most Southern states" also included "anticlimactic" "costly" and "self-inflicted".The largest percentage of those surveyed 31 percent described their first sexual experience as "anticlimactic"."This obviously indicates that premature ejaculation especially among virgins is more common than previously thought" said television's Dr. Phil. "In a sense a lot of people broke the toy before they got it out of the box."The second largest cohort 29 percent described their first sexual experience as "awesome". Whether this was a consequence of beginners' luck faulty memory or self-deception is a question for further study.Interestingly 23 percent of the respondents described their first sexual experience as "illegal in most Southern states"."There are a number of possible explanations for that response" said Dr. Phil. "Outdated Sabbath laws that remain on the books in many Southern states is the simplest one. What's perfectly legal on Saturday night fellatio in a moving motor vehicle for example is against the law on Sunday morning especially within five hundred yards of a church."In other cases sex with llamas or junior high school cheerleaders to name just two are illegal 24/7/365. If you do that in Dixie you're gonna do time."The next most popular response category "self-inflicted" is the most difficult to interpret. Just 15 percent of the respondents said their first sexual experience came in their own hands. Perhaps the old myths about going blind or growing hair on one's palms are more influential than we know. Perhaps people who chose "self-inflicted" misread the question. Future editions of the survey will need to get a better grip on this issue.Finally just 3 percent of respondents to the survey described their first sexual experience as costly. One suspects that this question was the most age-specific. As people get older their first sexual experiences tend to become more expensive for obvious reasons.
Tuesday 9 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/152587/are-you-the-master-of-your-bedroom,Are You the Master of Your Bedroom?,The true conservative does not like anything to happen that has not happened before. He prefers old dogs old friends old whiskey and old songs...old words too...and he's apt to become shirty when old words get surrounded by crime scene tape strung up by the low priests of political correctness and woke-fucking-culture.Such is the fate of "master bedroom." The Houston Association of Realtors eager to be correct and "woke" has announced that "master" would be replaced by "primary" in descriptions of bedrooms and bathrooms in all future association listings. This sniveling inglorious decision--a solution in search of a problem--was made after a group of real estate agents had requested a review of the term "master bedroom."Fair enough but the Department of Housing and Urban Development had conducted just such a review in 1995 in less fraught times...and decided that "master bedroom" was not discriminatory and did not violate fair housing laws.In more fraught times (June last year) the National Association of Realtors reached the same conclusion."NAR sees no reason that real estate professionals cannot use the term (master bedroom) as there is no evidence that it has any historical connection to slavery or any other kind of discrimination."No shit. Lincoln freed the slaves in 1865. "Master bedroom" appeared in a 1926 Sears mail order catalog. Unless you can find a much earlier example of its use Skippy  you'll look dumber than Jim Carrey if you claim a historical connection to slavery...or any connection to slavery other than imaginary.H.L. Mencken defined puritanism as "The haunting fear thatsomeone somewhere may be happy.” Progressives are haunted by the fear that someone somewhere may be using language or having a thought of which they do not approve. Still it's time to call a spade a spade. No sane non-hyperventilating person should be offended by "master bedroom" just as no sane non-hyperventilating non-certifiable person should be ashamed of the color of his or her skin; nor - most critically - fshould white people be offended by "master bedroom" on behalf of someone else.That's the pile of rocks with a snake in it. Beware white people who get offended on behalf of others who are not white. The fury of the I-feel-your-pain WINO (white in name only) is beyond reckoning and often exceeds the fury of those who "think" they have cause for offense.The triumph of feelings over facts in Houston and in other locations locations locations leads us to wonder what might be next. Chess master? Master's degrees? What about master plans pay masters the Master's Tournament master chefs Master Card Master P  mastermind Masterpiece Theater Master of Ceremonies Master of One's Own Domain?''It's enough to make a person weary. Fortunately we have a master bedroom to which to retire; and if one didn't exist we'd have to invent it.
Tuesday 9 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152586/white-house-cleaners-pleased-with-new-president,White House cleaners pleased with new president,In another exclusive for TheSpoof we interview Manuel Cisterna Ubendos who has been a cleaner in the White House for 14 years."I am very glad to have Mr Biden as president" said the 46-year-old Mexican. "All of the cleaning staff are. He makes our job easier. Especially compared to the last guy."According to Ubendos for the last four years he had to cope with a series of bizarre and unusual messes. He had to clean up countless sweat stains from Rudy Guiliani and scrub saliva from the many American flags in the property.Burger grease was the most common stain said Ubendos and it appeared in unexpected places. "Not just door handles but on windows even the ceiling." It is believed that the previous inhabitant would throw buckets of fast food around whenever he was angry which was often.The worst thing about the 45th president was his toilet habits. "Joe Biden knows how to flush" said Ubendos. "The last guy...well let's say he didn't need a toilet brush he needed a shovel."The one-term president often complained at his rallies about having to flush the toilet ten or fifteen times. Perhaps it is not surprising to learn that his stools were oversized and sludgy. "It was like someone had taken a fresh cow pat and thrown it across the room. It didn't just go in the bowl. It went on the floor sometimes the walls."The thing that annoyed Ubendos most about his former boss is not so much the mess but his attitude. "Not once did he thank me or apologize or even acknowledge my existence. And I was the one who had to clean up when he wiped his ass on the curtains."He continued "It's nice to work for a president who eats fibre again."

Tuesday 9 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/152584/ice-cream-maker-brought-vagina-cream-mainstream,Ice Cream Maker Brought Vagina Cream Mainstream,The Great British Ice Cream Company food scientists explain how they created the new vulva Phish Food flavor by unlocking the secrets to their Vagina Cream Swirl. Male and lesbian customers were nothing but grateful when The Great British Ice Cream Company debuted its inaugural vagina flavor in 2021. We were even more appreciative of the recent additions such as Non-Dairy London & Chill’d and “Milk” & Cookies. However the taste of these fabulous flavors kept us wanting more and longing for a vulva Phish Food intensified.Back in 2019 the company told a Gay News editor that this particular flavor presented a formidable hurdle: Vagina Cream Swirl. Ever loyal to its fans The Great British Ice Cream Company's dedicated flavor gurus set to work on the problem and soon they prevailed. Curious as to why Vagina Cream Swirl proved so challenging we interviewed one of the food scientists behind this new flavor Natalia Banghur.Here’s everything you need to know about the delicious science behind Vagina Cream Swirl.Benny and the Jetts a group of male samplers at a public tasting booth said "Vagina Cream Swirl smells like vagina and taste slightly salty with the flavor of soothing milk cream."The delightful treats are synthesized from the real pheromones and secretion of a real vagina. Its essentially water sugar and proteins—so what’s not to like? These ingredients provide the artificial secretions and vulva smell identical to vagina and the scrumptious gooey texture is beyond expectations when swirled into frozen cream.Unfortunately some women are not to thrilled over the new flavor while The Great British Ice Cream Company's marketing executives corner a new market among lonely teen males who are epicurious. It's made from collagen extracted from animal skin and ligaments (typically from cow and pig vaginas). Due to this cruel ingredient Vagina Cream Swirl isn't even vegetarian.While The Great British Ice Cream Company Vagina Cream Swirl is a triumph this ice cream company isn’t the first to sell this confection. "Daddy Pops" Gwyneth Paltrow's orgasm-scented icecream bars is the most accessible commercial vagina dessert in the US and it was the first vagina brand taste to become non-GMO certified. The classic Paltrow variety hit the shelves—in direct competition with Vagina Cream Swirl. Since then Paltrow's pumped out copyright free seasonal flavors such as Jolie's Peppermint Clit and Brittany's Pumpkin Spice Orgasmic Fascination.Banghura explained the development process to create shelf-stable vagina brands:“Our biggest hurdle was that there wasn’t a guidebook for how to make a vagina icecream that’s stable enough to have a long shelf life with quality natural ingredients. We literally had to re-envision the entire process for making the vagina flavor from the ground up to do what we wanted to do."The pillowy sweet Vagina Cream Swirl so many have grown to love via the original Phish Food is different from traditional shelf-stable icecream because it contains an unlikely ingredient: real vagina chemistry. Banghur explained that the process of synthesizing this ingredient was tedious as the team had to “go back to the drawing board” several times. They were determined to produce something that was as close to a real vagina as possible but mass-producing this was an issue particularly during the pandemic.“We’d test out different swirls via video calls!” Banghur said. “We also did a lot of sampling using real women in our own mixers at home.”Banghur informed us about “swirl technology” which involves specific machinery used to crank out pint after pint. She noted “What worked in small batches in our kitchen doesn’t always translate when we go to make it in larger batches. Once we nailed that down then comes the easy part—we let the technology do the rest.”Now The Great British Ice Cream Company has cracked the code on the endless possibilities our minds immediately jump to other vagina flavors waiting to be released.

A group of toussle-haired sinister-looking neanderthals with few teeth and only a roundabout idea of what a school or soap is.If drinking beer were an academic subject these people would be university professors but it's not and they aren't.It was going to be a long afternoon and not being able to speak the lingo the Englishman planned for the lack of opportunity for any kind of social discourse by putting 'The Master and Margarita' by the esteemed Russian writer Mikhail Bulgakov in his bag.On arriving at the gathering the 'piano stopped' and every face turned towards the Kenwood group. To evade this spotlight Mr. Kenwood adjourned to a quiet area under a tree and started to read.Singing commenced people laughed and shouted unedible food was eaten and beer was drunk.A splendid time was had by all including the reader who covered a leisurely 56 pages.

He then added that furthermore he would never be caught dead wearing one of those hideously atrocious plain white robes and hoods.The infamous journalist added that he would rather wear a ballerina’s shocking pink outfit than those burlap-like atrocities that homeless people in Guatemala wouldn't even wear.He said that he did try one on once when he was working in the United States but he said it itched like hell it smelled like raw sewage and it gave him the runs.Piers said that he spoke to his BFF the Queen and she has offered for him to stay at Balmoral Castle until the rumors of his involvement with a white extremist supremist group die down.In the meantime Morgan says that he plans on writing a tell-all-book on Meghan Markle Prince Harry and little bitty Archie.
Wednesday 10 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/world/152599/missing-paper-clip-turns-up-safe-and-sound,Missing Paper Clip Turns Up Safe And Sound,An ordinary office paper clip that was lost during some routine paperwork recently has turned up safe and sound calming fears that something sinister might have happened to it.It was discovered nestling underneath a computer keyboard earlier this afternoon.The steel clip was one of thousands of other identical clips which are used to fasten pieces of paper together in an orderly fashion.It had been misplaced by a teacher who was marking examination papers but when the time came to secure the sheets in one place the paper clip could not be located and a substitute had to be used instead.Although the teacher was not overly-concerned about the missing office stationery item at the time he could not completely forget it and wondered for quite a while just where it could have got to.A quick scout around had failed to unearth it and until the man moved his computer keyboard about three o'clock this afternoon the paper clip had remained hidden from sight.On finding his old friend the paper clip the teacher was overjoyed and said:"I honestly thought it had been lost forever but it just shows how having faith in something can produce an unexpected ending."But in truth he hadn't had faith in it at all and expected that it had probably been kicked under somewhere inaccessible or stolen by a paper clip mogul or collector.

Wednesday 10 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/sport/152598/the-dallas-cowboys-have-just-fired-everyone-of-their-cheerleaders,The Dallas Cowboys Have Just Fired Everyone of Their Cheerleaders,(NOT EDITED) DALLAS – (Sports Satire) – At the end of the last NFL season Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones promised his Cowboy fans that he would do whatever it takes to improve his team.Jones told Hiawatha Pamplona with Sports Territory Magazine that he hired a highly reputable sports consulting firm from Dubai India to study the situation and give him some suggestions.The firm spent 8 weeks studying every aspect of the Cowboys team from their choice of condoms to their religious beliefs. They even studied the types of beer each player drinks and if when he goes shopping at the supermarket if he asks for paper or plastic (bags).They finally reached their decision. Jerry was told that there is really no problem with the team. The offense the defense the special teams and even the guy that is in charge of providing the Gatorade are all doing a good job.Jones was then shocked when he was told that the problem lies solely with the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders.The result showed that the little old gals just ain’t rah-rahing like they should be.The firm said that on a scale of 1 to 10 their energy level is barely at a 1.8.They noted that a hibernating Wyoming bear has more spirit than the “Cowgals” do.So Jones called a meeting and told the entire 32-member cheerleading squad that they were all being fired immediately. Screams yells and shouts rang out in the parking lot. One girl tried to slash her wrist with a lipstick case.Another began hitting her head with a box of tampons and another tried to bite her breast (?).One even jumped toward Jerry Jones in a threatening manner but she was quickly pepper-sprayed by Mrs. Jerry Jones.Security was called and all the girls were hauled off the property.Meanwhile Jerry has put out the word that any girls wishing to apply to be Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders for the 2021-2022 season can call him toll-free at 1-000-555-YELL.
Wednesday 10 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152597/the-potato-heads-have-become-a-political-item,The Potato Heads Have Become a Political Item.,The Potato Heads Have Become a Political Item.The whole genderless thing has now been inflicted on even that most American of characters- Mr. Potato Head and his family.Hasbro the manufacturer of Mr. Potato Head that has been a Christmas stocking stuffer since the 1950’s has now announced a new sexless ‘Potato Head’ doll that is without a distinguishing male or female demarcation. The Potato Heads are no longer a her or he- they are an ‘it’.Thanks for screwing up my childhood you Bozos! And my safe definition of what determines male and female in our society from that time. It was very comfy way back when to know that men have mustaches and wear bowler hats (although my aunt Emily dear lady that she was also had a mustache which did cause some concern and confusion for me) and Mrs. Potato Head had bangs a purse and loud red lipstick. And that made the differentials very obvious. Thanks for blowing that all to hell!Now there will be no distinction between Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head. Kids will be allowed to put whatever additions they want onto the generic spudly. They can go full-blown trans-gender and put long eyelashes on Mr. Potato head and a goatee on what was once the Mrs. What does it matter anymore?Why do this? Aren’t potatoes pretty non-sexual to begin with? Aren’t they about the least sexy thing there is already? THEY ARE SPUDS!!! They are born to be the most common mundane food there is. They were transplanted to Europe from the Americas by Christopher Columbus where they became the normal food of the Irish and of Vincent van Gogh paintings of peasants. Of course they ended up killing off the Irish in droves when they picked up a blight but other than that they pretty much stayed quiet and kept a low profile throughout the centuries. And what are they here in the States but cheap side additions to omelets and to every biggie sized burger basket in every fast food franchise that exists.Yes you do get some radical potatoes that insist on showing off and donning themselves in risque colors like lurid purple and scandalously vibrant red colors but these are just your occasional non-conformist and bohemian renegades like you get in any species.Other than that potatoes are the most bland suburban edible entity you could get.Now with all vestiges of their sex obliterated kids will be making them into all sorts of weird non-wholesome potato-like concoctions. Long hair and makeup on the male spuds so that they won’t be studs and they look like Mick Jagger or Alice Cooper in their early 70’s incarnations. Once feminine potatoes will have crew cuts (which never looked good even on men) tattoos and will be smoking cigars. Piercings will be abundant; not that piercings matter much to a potato. They were pretty much by their bulbous Nature asking to be pierced.Because of this new development the Potato Head family will probably end up with more new attachments than Barbie has accessories. Hats strangely shaped noses and ears removable tattoos and scars bizarre studs and rings. God forbid however should Hasbro come up with assorted ‘naughty bits’ for them. That could get really bizarre and obscene.

Harris said that she is positively pleased at how Meghan conducted herself against all of the hateful mean despicable abuse that the royals tossed at her.One unnamed ‘firm’ member even said that Markle hates hip hop and rap music which is totally untrue.Harry says his baby cakes has several albums by Nicki Minaj Cardi B and Black Kitty Meow Meow.He said that if it had been him he would have told the royal majestically verbal abuser how the cow ate the cabbage how the beaver built the dam and how the mud dauber daubed it’s nest.London’s Tickety Boo News reportedly stated that the Queen was nothing but kind and civil to Meghan Markle. And they added that her majesty and her husband are going to be filing a $7.1 million lawsuit against Oprah Winfrey for blatant Habeas Facto Ad Hoc Dilicti.Meanwhile Oprah Winfrey Beyonce and Yo Yo Afro Woke are planning on working on a documentary on the beautifully charming Camilla Parker Bowles.
Wednesday 10 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152594/governor-newsom-caught-inside-his-personal-mcdonalds-with-sausage-mcmuffin-not-confirmed,Governor Newsom caught inside his personal McDonald's with Sausage McMuffin NOT confirmed,The Governor of California's rules state that the tier color purple does not allow eating inside restaurants.The basic principle here is that covid does not roam as freely in 39% weather on the patio especially in wind and rain.This conclusion is based on algorithms in the governor's computer and advised by Silicon Valley.Not covered in the main stream and in parallel to the VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System) is the Outdoor Dining Adverse Responses System (ODARS).Ambulances are sometimes mustered to outdoor dining facilities where customers have fallen during attempts to eat their meals.The Governor's problem is this: twice already he has been caught violating his own rule once in Napa and recently in Fresno.The question of Mr. Newsom's Sausage McMuffin indulgence is therefore serious.Mr. Newsom has been a firm advocate of the rules since he created them himself. To break them is thus unthinkable.Yet his critics say breaking them is exactly what he's been doing adding to his possible problems in coping with a recall election.Would he purchase a McDonald's for his personal use and due to a weakness for Sausage McMuffin?Reporters are scurrying to confirm this latest report due to its importance in any upcoming recall election.This particular McDonald's had been suffering financially with declining business and homeless piled up in its parking lot.The Governor is also reputed to have said—more than once—that “A day without Sausage McMuffin is inconceivable to me.”Meanwhile across the nation a “war of the governors” continues with mostly red state governors re-opening their states and easing up on mask mandates.A few days ago Mr. Newsom turned blue in the face at this news of mask abandoning and insisted the nation should go to double-masking.“Reckless reckless!” he said about this easing up on the rules.According to insiders running a McDonald's may be inviting as career alternative for Mr. Newsom at this time.

If I was wrong about that what else have I been wrong about?' wailed Stephen.
Thursday 11 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/sport/152489/liverpool-goalkeeper-alisson-makes-further-blunders,Liverpool Goalkeeper Alisson Makes Further Blunders,Liverpool blundering goalkeeper Alisson is again in the news this morning not for his error-strewn performances between the sticks but according to his girlfriend for several Alzheimers-like howlers at home.The hapless Brazilian has been at the centre of criticism during the Premier League champions' recent slump in form after gifting Manchester City and Leicester City victories against the Reds with catastrophic schoolboy mistakes.Now however it's come to light through some intensive undercover detective journalism - and a certain amount of imagination - that the goalie has been 'slipping up' at home as well.Alisson's girlfriend Alison claims that Alisson leaves the toilet seat up rarely flushes - even after a poo - and NEVER washes his hands afterwards.The big daft lummox often forgets to recharge his phone's battery at night and to put the milk bottles out for the milkman. Alison said:"He's always leaving both the living-room light and the TV on and just goes upstairs to bed. The other day he came home and left his key in the front door after he'd unlocked it!"The worst case of this absent-mindedness however came when he reported for training last Thursday and it was noticed by several of Liverpool's squad that he was wearing his underpants inside-out revealing an unsightly skid mark.Liverpool's Scottish left back Andy Robertson said:"Och aye the noo! Ye shoulda seen that skiddy. It was fucken groosome!"Manager Jürgen Klopp has spoken to Alisson in private about the situation but this has been severely undermined by the German's own recent list of catastrophic gaffes including most notably a horrendous run of six successive home defeats.
Thursday 11 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/uk/152603/prince-harry-and-piers-morgan-to-have-a-fight,Prince Harry And Piers Morgan To Have A Fight,In a controversial move to outcontroversialise them all Prince Harry has thrown down the Royal Gauntlet to the outspoken former Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan.Morgan was severely critical of Harry's wife Meghan Markle and her unprecedented comments about the Royal household in an interview this week in which she also spoke about her mental health issues and the insidious racist attitude of the British tabloid press.Morgan scoffed at these and said he didn't believe a word she'd said. On Wednesday came the news that he was no longer a part of 'Good Morning Britain'.Harry the troubled royal wasted no time and 'offered Morgan out'.So far the loudmouth ex-presenter has not responded to Harry's challenge but is expected to come up with something smarmy fairly soon.Bookmakers say they expect there to be an extraordinary amount of interest in the outcome and the early favourite seems to be the Ginger Prince.In related news the whole farcical affair concerning Harry and Meghan's retreat from the Royal scene is rumoured to be the possible subject for another in the series of 'Carry On' films.
Thursday 11 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/uk/152607/village-tears-down-statue-of-piers-morgan,Village tears down statue of Piers Morgan,The sleepy village of Chaffinch St Cock was the centre of controversy today after last night a mob with torches tore down the statue of Piers Morgan that stood in the village square.The statue depicted the celebrity journalist squatting over the very toilet that he used when he paid a visit to the "worst village in Britain" in 2014. It was left smashed by the roadside after the crowd demolished it. The reason for its destruction was apparently because of Morgan's immature and selfish behaviour in storming off Good Morning Britain on Tuesday when confronted with his immature and selfish behaviour.Village priest Reverend Geoff Touche said he was glad that the statue had been torn down. "Morgan is demonic by his very nature. I hated to see this idol every day on my way to church. The goats didn't like it either - it spooked them when we brought them to the church for Sunday sacrifice. We practice a very pagan form of Christianity here."Other villagers were pleased with the outcome. Butcher Geoff Jefferson couldn't stand the "monstrous" statue. "Everybody knows Piers is a c***. Why would you want a status of a c*** in yer village? Bunch of c***s!"However there was one person in the village who defended the statue and said it was a travesty that it had been torn down. Tea-shop owner Piers Morgan who was born Nancy Mrectum but changed her name to Piers Morgan when she became president of the Piers Morgan fan club was angry. "This is just cancel culture. You can't cancel a statue no more than you can cancel a cup of tea once you've ordered it.”She continued “Piers is a national hero. Considering his journalistic career he is very much like a slave trader bringing misery and suffering to millions for profit. And he defends the bigotry of the royal family like a true patriot. So this historic monument that I paid for should have stood until the end of time.”
Thursday 11 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152609/meghan-worries-and-suffers-like-no-other,Meghan worries and suffers like no other...,Following the 'whistleblowing' interview with Oprah Winfrey details have emerged of both a spicy and grim nature regarding the Royal Family not broadcast during the show.Meghan Markle Duchess of Sussex claims that all three children of the Duchess of Cambridge Charlotte George and Louis are partial to cheese and onion crisps."Wait a minute" says Winfrey "Slow down let's go back there. Are you saying these kids are allowed to get fat and the poor British public then has to pay for treatment to their obesity?" and sits with her mouth open for forty seconds without eating which is a kind of record for the let's say stout star of TV."Well sometimes they eat smoky bacon but I think that's just as bad.""Too right too right. And who allows this?" Winfrey can be heard asking."I'd rather not say" replies Meghan. She does mention a name but the recording is faint. "They also eat chocolate. Lots of it." At this Winfrey begins to weep and cameras are switched off.Such revelations are bound to damage the Royals' image throughout the world though only a malicious rogue would suggest there was any intent on Meghan and Winfrey's behalf. No sir!!A scene at the end shows Meghan applying suntan cream to Harry's forehead and neck."He has very sensitive skin it's extremely white and reddish and...ooops..." says the Duchess."Don't worry dear" whispers Winfrey "we'll cut that out..."

Desperate male scientists decided to swallow Pfizer's co-product Viagra for a quick bunk over the Bunsen burner during coffee breaks but this only worked partially for them. Females scientists were still left dry and sagging!One morning after a 24hour shift one male scientist was so knackered on the way home he passed a local farm shop and drank a litre of cow's milk straight from the udder (well nearly). Getting home he jumped on his wife who had been ordering toy-boys and the latest hi-tech vibrator from Amazon to satisfy her needs. She screamed "Eureka at last!"Next morning the scientist passed the farm again and ordered several cans of cow’s milk to take to the lab! He told his knackered colleagues this is the latest scientific secret to 'getting it on' during stressful periods like these. He even told them his missus had six orgasms after not having sex for the last six months!The Robert Koch Institute have written a report in their prestigious science magazine confirming the fact cow’s milk straight from the udder has been scientifically proven by their scientists to be much more potent than internet porno Viagra or playing with your dildo's!This is a relief for wives and husbands of knackered scientists doctors professors or anybody involved in defeating the pandemic a litre of cow’s milk a day will raise their libido and life can get back to normal thank the good old cow MOO!!After this mega-discovery stocks and shares in anything to do with milk farming rocketed through the roof!

But they soon learned that they were actually four times smarter and seven times happier (and hornier) than the regular run-of-the-mill lizards.Meanwhile millions of people living in the three mentioned states are extremely upset that the term horny toad is still being used in elementary schools day care centers and women’s bingo clubs.Residents of Joplin Missouri have even started up a petition to demand that photos of these lizard-like creatures and descriptions be removed from all Missouri state geography books as well as Episiterian bibles.One sick 79-year-old woman named Chunka May Mudficker even went as far as washing her granddaughter’s mouth out with soap for mentioning the dreaded word(s).Well grandma Chunka May was reported to the Missouri Child Welfare Protective Agency and she was hit with a $9000 fine plus she was sentenced to jail for 7 weeks and warned not to come within 26 miles of her granddaughter for 12 years.The granddaughter was thrilled and remarked that she never really liked her grandmother who she divulged smells like a cross between Preparation H hydrochloric acid Bud Light and asparagus.

Kyrzyk from Prickly Pear Arizona told Hollywood Vis-à-Vis that she was embarrassed and devastated at the critique she received from Katy Perry.Birdy sang a self-penned song titlted "He Started Kissing Me On The Patio and Ended Up Kissing Me On The Badonkadonk". After she finished Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan both stayed silent.Katy however made several faces and then told Birdy that she was the most horrible singer that she had ever heard.Perry who has had such hits as “I Kissed a Girl” “I Necked With a Girl” and the most recent “Hey I’m a Girl” went on to say that Birdy was so bad that her left ear was actually bleeding.Katy added that she couldn't find the beat if it was sitting on her boobs. As as for the pitch it was MIA. The new-mama remarked that her vibrato was so loud it could drown out a lightning bolt.Birdy began to weep and then cry and then wail like she was being attacked by killer bees. She even tried to slash her wrist with a handy Dixie cup.The next day Hollywood Vis-à-Vis reported that Birdy had hired the services of famed attorney and Nancy Pelosi-lookalike Gloria Allred.The Arizona native divulged that she had filed a $955000 lawsuit against American Idol Hercules Brand Condoms and Katy Perry.Katy was asked for a comment and replied that she had hired Gloria Allred’s daughter Ginger to defend her.American Idol host Ryan Seacrest was asked for a comment and remarked that Birdy had a pretty smile mesmerizing eyes and one sweet-looking cute little ass.
Thursday 11 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/entertainment-gossip/152605/the-duke-and-duchess-escaped-but-are-back,The Duke And Duchess Escaped But Are Back,Who knew it could be so tough being royal! No wonder Hamlet said “To be or not to be?” Gosh he must have been desperate. Too.Compare the plush royal life to a bride married to a 9 to 5 worker instead of a Prince. The bride also has to have a real 9 to 5 job drop the kid off at daycare work all day buy groceries for supper pick up the kid from daycare drive home (no chauffeur for this 9 to 5 lady) then prepare supper eat bathe and put the kid to bed. Then collapse in her bed.Then start the whole Ground Hog Day again the next morning.But at least the heavily overwhelmed willfully ignored and notoriously private royal two-some got their very private laundry out into the public venue for all to scrutinize. Bravo!And the deep pockets generous enough to pay the two-some the princely sum of $7 million bucks. That ain’t no vegan kind of money!The Sussex’s aren’t alone though. There are other kids with needs who are also being ignored. They would welcome any food or shelter. They would even take a fully furnished or empty Kensington Palace or Frogmore House.Those kids are the children still at the US border who not by any choice of their own are separated from their parents. Those children cry at night for their parents. They are also overwhelmed ignored and troubled. But they are children.A good reason to focus on instead of spoiled grown-ups to those border children. Move those children out of cages and concrete bedding and into places like Kensington Palace or Frogmore House until they could be reunited with their parents and family.Trapped border children have real needs. Deep pockets should focus on that kind of child.Read more by this author:

Trump POS award will be given out virtually in early December. As an aside the prize will most likely also be given out virtually in future years because it is unlikely that the winner will opt to receive it in person.The award is intended to recognize the politician who best represents the character and qualities exhibited by former-president Trump: Amorality narcissism disregard for truth and lack of judgement will be particularly considered when determining who wins the award. This award comes with a designer-made orange jumpsuit a bronze weasel paperweight for one’s desk and a partial payment of Rudy Giuliani’s legal fees.The Foundation in addition to the president vice president and 50 state governors can only consider politicians who are in Congress or are Cabinet level officials. The Foundation is bipartisan and will consider any worthy candidate regardless of race gender sexual preference or party affiliation. It will also recognize that your ex your boss or the president of your condo association may be a genuine POS but such individuals are ineligible for the award unless they fall into one of the aforementioned categories.The foundation already has some excellent candidates for this year’s award and encourages nominations. It may seem like Andrew Cuomo is a cinch for this year’s award but it is only March.We will update you on this from time to time.

Thursday Mar. 11. Spoof Capitol Bureau. A Woof Blister Commentary for The Spoof.President Joe Biden gave his first post-inauguration "fireside chat" Thursday evening as he ended his first "Fifty Days" in office.Normally presidents tout their first "Hundred Days" as John Kennedy and Franklin Roosevelt - particularly Roosevelt - did. Roosevelt with an overwhelming Democratic majority in both House and Senate signed an unbelievable amount of legislation in his first "Hundred Days" all related to easing the Great Depression. Biden with only a tie-breaking majority in the Senate was able to brag about only one significant bill his American Rescue package last night. It passed with no votes to spare. He signed it before his speech.Biden chose to make the telecast to pat himself on the back for having achieved in 50 days a faster pace toward his goal of vaccinations by the end of the "Hundred Days". He told his audience that we were more than halfway to that goal in only fifty days. The assumption is that by the end of the "Hundred Days" we will be well over his prediction - unless something goes wrong!WAIT A MINUTE! The "Hundred Days" goal didn't start with FDR. It started with Napoleon Bonaparte. On March 13 1815 at Lyon after his escape from his Elba exile Napoleon ordered the dissolution of the existing French government essentially resuming power and began his march to Paris which he entered a week later. March 13 marked the start of his "Hundred Days" of power. In between he drew up a new constitution guaranteeing voting rights and freedom of the press. He also offered a return to French greatness. Had he had a TV he would have had a lot more to cheer about than Biden.BUT WAIT ANOTHER MINUTE! On June 18 a foreign coalition overwhelmed Napoleon's army at Waterloo bringing his "Hundred Days" of power to an end leading to his second exile this time at St. Helena where his life ended.WHAT DOES THIS PORTEND FOR BIDEN? Let's hope he doesn't schedule a national victory speech for his "Hundred Days" at Waterloo... Iowa. By then moderate Democrats may have defected on crucial votes in the Senate leaving his legislation dead thanks to a bi-partisan coalition.

Friday 12 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/152621/exclusive-conversation-with-man-whose-shit-doesnt-stink,Exclusive Conversation with Man Whose Shit Doesn't Stink,A twenty-five-year-old local man whose shit literally does not stink has blamed his rare condition for ruining his life. The unfortunate man - whom we will call “Helado” the Spanish word for “ice cream” - told us his story over lunch at the Iron Hill Brewery last week. That story was a nightmare of broken friendships sorry affairs and growing isolation.“People resent anyone or anything different” said Helado. “Just because they go through a can of Febreze® every week in their stinking bathrooms they think everybody else should too; and if you don’t well there must be something wrong with you.”What’s wrong with Helado is a rare condition known as Rückstände ohne Geruch in which the intestinal flora work too aggressively to remove odor-causing toxins during the digestive process. This condition affects approximately one out of 750000 people.Persons with Rückstände ohne Geruch could shit themselves in a crowded elevator and nobody would be the wiser. They could live on a Taco Bell diet eating nothing but burritos tacos and double orders of refried beans - as Helado has done - but nothing’s going to make them smell like mere mortals. People with Rückstände ohne Geruch can fart with impunity on a rush-hour bus.A slight nervous neatly-dressed young man Helado said he began to realize he was different when he was growing up in a one-bathroom row-house in South Philadelphia with his three older siblings his working-class parents and his paternal grandmother.“With so many people in the house the bathroom was frequently occupied and there was a lot of teasing back and forth about who ‘really stunk up the joint’. You know that predictable row-house humor.”In this tribe of bowl busters Helado stood out like a tomato plant in a septic field.“People got on my case because the bathroom didn’t smell like a diaper pail after I had used it. My father who always favored my brothers and sister began mocking me all the time. ‘Don’t mind him’ he’d tell my siblings ‘he’s just stuck up because he thinks his shit doesn’t stink.’ There are few worse insults to a prole’s way of thinking.”Although Helado was an excellent tennis player he decided not to try out for his high school team because he was afraid his teammates would mock him if they discovered his secret. His father took the news in stride.“Don’t mind him he’s too good to play tennis because he thinks his shit doesn’t stink.”When it came time for Helado to go to college - ”I was the first member of my family who wasn’t too slow to get accepted anyplace” - he wanted to go to a school in the city so he could commute and save money. His father had other ideas.“It’s time you were out in the real world Mr. My Shit Doesn’t Stink!”Reluctantly Helado went off to college. At first he tried to conceal his condition by using the bathroom in the dorm suite only when his three roommates weren’t there. If he did use the loo in the suite he sprayed vigorously with Febreze® to mask his non-odor.But there are no secrets in dorm rooms” Helado laughed ruefully. “My roommates eventually found out about my quote unquote condition. They were OK about it for a while and I was beginning to think I might be able to lead a normal life if I confined my close social contacts to college-educated people.“Then toward the middle of my freshman year I noticed a change in my roommates. Their jokes became more cutting as though they resented me. I came back early from class one day and overheard one of my roommates saying ‘Just because his shit doesn’t stink he thinks he’s better than us.’ I was so hurt. I’m not the kind of person who thinks he’s better than everyone else.”By the end of the school year his roommates were using the public restroom at the end of their floor rather than the one in their suite. The next year they all sought different roommates.Helado also admitted sadly that his problem affected his liebesleben as well as his friendships.“Fecal odor’s the third rail of dating relationships” he said. “Nobody wants to talk about it but as soon as a woman who smells like the inside of a dead Apache’s loin cloth realizes that you don’t you can kiss her ass good-bye assuming you’d want to.”Helado is content for now with quick impersonal sex often with prostitutes.“It’s OK I guess if your idea of intimacy includes someone who chews gum while she gives you head but eventually I’d like a real relationship. Maybe I’ll try a classified add 'SWM with Rückstände ohne Geruch seeks SWF with same for long walks on the beach and quiet nights eating kimchi by the fireplace.'”

And like my daddy used to say back in Scranton: Joey you can always tell a good decent man and woman by the way they pronounce the word Massachusetts.”

A farcical comedy most of its humor revolved around mistaken identity and the use of puns slapstick and word play. The play’s title has become an idiom for “an event or series of events made ridiculous by the number of errors that were made throughout.”Oprah in her own  Comedy of Heirs touched all of the bases. She came out slicker than a snake oil sales woman using racial implications and innuendo instead of puns slapstick and word play to carry the narrative. Meghan recalled that she was reduced to tears because her sister-in-law didn’t agree with her regarding the dresses for the flower girls in the wedding. The international audience was left slobbering in their own self-guilt.Meghan who is 39 years old - three years older than Harry - quite likely is going through menopause so these episodes are not unexpected. She also claimed that racially insensitive remarks were made about the color of her son’s skin and that he would not be given a royal title because of it.Oprah was deeply affected by the inequities of being a person of color. She herself has suffered immeasurably from being a Black American woman - her current worth is estimated to be 2.7 billion. She couldn’t believe that this could happen to such an innocent gold digger. With a look of empathy not displayed since Larry Moe and Curly made people cry her audience was brought to tears by the pathetic recital of woe.Dr. Slim: "The Comedy of Heirs my ass!"Dirty: "Yo Doctor. Are you sure you ain’t the Bard of Avon reincarnated?"

Since Barack Obama got one he wants one too. But each year he fails to meet his date with destiney and the prize is awarded to someone else.Maybe starting an insurrection this year might have had something to do with it. And standing in front of the White House and announcing to a group of rebels “You have to fight for your country.”Fight may not be the proper term to use when campaigning for the Nobel Peace Prize.Now if Trump were hunkering for a piece of apple pie or a piece of chocolate cake that piece of pie or cake would be his. But awarded a piece of pie or cake isn’t the kind of Peace award that he would like. He wants the Nobel Peace Prize.As well as not promoting an insurrection and reframing from telling people they should fight maybe he should also not ridicule or mimic people with physical handicaps. Or not call people derogatory names? And not cage children pull them away from their mothers destroy their records and send them into victimhood.How about not giving tax breaks to the richest top shelf millionaires of the nation and instead help those who earn less than minimum wage? That would be one giant step toward the Nobel Peace Prize but instead Trump always seemed to be after helping just the fat cats.No offense meant for kitty cats or the fat kitty cats; just the tax paying kind of fat cats.Read more by this author:
Friday 12 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/uk/152614/the-us-supreme-court-fails-again,The US Supreme Court Fails Again,Gay News— The Supreme Court has gone bananas again with Thomas leading the loony bin. The hypocritical people who sit on the highest court ruled on Monday that a student in Georgia could pursue a lawsuit challenging speech restrictions at his college even though he sought only nominal damages.During a Supreme Court seance calling on the spirit of someone much wiser Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg enters the court proceedings to give her opinions.Ginsburg said "The ruling should have stated that the constitution protects religion only within its establishment based on the first amendment's constitutional passage referring to religion."Ginsburg continued "If this were not the case then religious maniacs would use freedom of religion to break into people's homes to preach to them whilst they slumbered! Religion has to obey other Constitutional passages.""We would all live in a chaotic world if it were up to Thomas" Ginsburg proclaimed.Based on Gainburg's idea the English Founding Fathers set the boundary for religion by adding the word "establishment" to prevent religion from invading other forms of the general establishment like an educational establishment a business establishment a homestead establishment and a government establishment. To comply with the Constitution religion in an educational college can only be discussed in a classroom curriculum about religion like History of Religion Religion in Modern Times Hindu Religion in Perspective or Religion During the Renaissance."Religion is not protected by freedom of speech outside of its establishment because the founding fathers separated the concept ''freedom of speech" from "establishment of religion" using the word "or" in the first amendment passage" the spirit of Ginsburg continued. "Thomas has converted himself into a religious cleric or Ayatollah God help us all!"Ginsburg said that based on the constitution religion has freedom of speech inside a church building or within a private television channel that doesn't have free public access. If not then other religions could preach their unusual ideology in that college. Examples are Satanic religions Muslim religions Hindu religions pagan religions or strange religions with unconventional undertones like the concept that God is a Kumari Puja or that Greek Hellenic goddesses like Hedone goddess of pleasure and Aphrodite goddess of sex and beauty require lust and sex daily in the presence of their images as a form of worship.The constitution states in its own words: Amendment 1- Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech.Justice Clarence Thomas writing for the majority in the 8-to-1 decision said a request for even a token sum typically a dollar satisfied the Constitution’s requirement that federal courts decide only actual cases or controversies in cases. "Well Thomas? Then decide already on the core of the case! You're inside a federal courthouse! The American people are tired of the legal manipulations and lies” said Ginsburg.The fact that the college had withdrawn the speech code challenged in the suit he wrote did not make the case moot. "Thomas is trying to ignore the real Constitutional issue to prevent a justifiable precedent against the church he attends. The case is not based on free speech or whether a $1.00 bill keeps a case active but instead it's based on the boundaries of the religious establishment" said Ginsburg.“Despite being small” Justice Thomas wrote “nominal damages are certainly concrete.” "Not as concrete as your draconian ideas and your big ears! You're wasting taxpayers' money!" said Gainsburg.In a spirited dissent Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said the majority’s approach would have the effect of “turning judges into advice columnists.”"Mr. Roberts must be clairvoyant because he knows I give horoscope advice on the Daily News" said Thomas.The case concerned Chike Uzuegbunam who in 2016 ran afoul of the authorities at Georgia Gwinnett College a public institution in Lawrenceville Ga. that sprawls over 260 acres. The college had designated two small patches of concrete as “free speech expression areas.”Mr. Uzuegbunam an evangelical Christian tried to comply with the rules reserving a spot in one of the zones to talk about his faith. But after other students complained a campus police officer told him that he could only distribute literature and have one-on-one conversations in a religious privately-funded college. Public speaking in a free speech zone the officer said amounted to disorderly conduct based on the constitutional law of "establishment" of a religion."Believe in what I say or you all will burn in hell" said Mr. Uzuegbunam.Uzuegbunam sued saying the college’s policies violated his First Amendment rights. The college briefly defended its policy arguing that the discussion of his faith amounted to “fighting words” that are not protected by the Constitution.“Plaintiff used contentious religious language that when directed to a crowd tends to incite hostility” the college’s lawyers wrote.But the college soon abandoned the defense of its speech code. Its revised policy which allowed students to speak anywhere on campus made the case moot its lawyers argued in court.A trial judge agreed and the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta affirmed her ruling.The question for the justices in a broader sense was whether there was anything left to decide when the government changed a policy after being sued and the plaintiff asked for only nominal damages to acknowledge the constitutional violation."There is no constitutional violation! The religious speech needs to remain within its establishment or there won't be any boundaries of respect or peaceful cohabitation" Ginsburg continued. "Give a proper judgment for God's sake! You're not the Taliban" yelled Ginsburg.
Friday 12 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/entertainment-gossip/152613/prince-harry-is-digging-a-tunnel,Prince Harry Is Digging A Tunnel,It’s rumored that Prince Harry is busy digging a tunnel to get back home to England and that he is presently under Nebraska. How he plans to cross the Atlantic isn’t clear. Palace sources whisper that brother William promised to have a speedboat waiting for him when he surfaces in New York.If the speedboat is fast enough and he makes the Atlantic crossing in one day he won’t have to worry about fishing for his supper but he will pack a supply of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.The Royal Navy offered to help with their submarine fleet but it’s believed Harry can make the trip back home similar to his trip to the South Pole.Learning about all those rumors which he referred to as vicious vile and vexing Harry labeled the tunnel dig as a heap of vindictive nonsense adding if he wanted to visit his place of birth again he’d just charge a first class British Air ticket on his dad's voluminous account.“So who has to dig tunnels anyway?”Harry went on to explain without any vagueness that he was under fire with real bullets in Afghanistan where he flew helicopters and fought the enemy and had graduated from Sandhurst Military Academy started the successful Invictus Games played lots of winning Polo and that the Queen’s grandson doesn't have to dig a tunnel to visit England.Though wearing a miner’s hat with a lamp the rumors were soon laid to rest. However there was an empty speedboat anchored in New York called Vengeance and pointed toward England.Read more by this author:
Friday 12 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152612/man-with-assault-rifle-goes-on-shooting-spree,Man With Assault Rifle Goes On Shooting Spree,Grand Rapids Michigan man Jerry Trigger has been arrested and charged with 30 counts of first degree murder for shooting up a church. The Church of the Hawaiian Flying Spaghetti Monster has been devastated by this event because the 30 members of the church who were shot were well liked.“He couldn’t have shot the 30 people who none of us liked could he?” asked Reverend Parmesan. He should have contacted us before the shooting and we would happily have given him a list of people to shoot who we don’t like.” This is a damn shame.”Trigger had a standoff with police after the shooting where he held seven church members hostage. After 2 hours Trigger agreed to surrender if they gave him a happy meal. The police complied and Trigger went into custody without incident.The Church of the Hawaiian Spaghetti Monster is an offshoot of the Church of the Spaghetti Monster. Like its parent church the congregation all wore colanders on the top of their heads to protect them from the spaghetti monster which according to the Center of Disease Control only works when you are wearing a mask and are social-distancing. The unique characteristic of this church is that all of the members wear Hawaiian shirts.Apparently during interrogation with Trigger police discovered the motive of his shooting spree was due to his hatred of Hawaiian shirts.“He got his hatred of Hawaiian shirts when he was a teenager” stated police chief Oversight. “His family was vacationing in Hawaii when a giant pineapple wearing a Hawaiian shirt hit him on the head with a rotten herring.“It was the Hawaiian shirt on the giant pineapple” stated Oversight. “Had the giant pineapple been wearing an Izod shirt it would have been OK.”As of press time Trigger’s lawyer gave a press conference stating that hits spree happened because shortly after entering the church Trigger had a stroke while his finger was on the trigger of the gun which explains the shooting.

Saturday 13 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/science-technology/152638/modern-men-do-not-know-which-position-it-is-best-to-pee,Modern men do not know which position it is best to pee!,(NOT EDITED) The scientific fraternity although being confronted with a global pandemic have not forgotten one of the most important issues the global male population has to deal with; which position is the best for males to pee in?Females really do not have any problems of pee splashing onto their legs because they sit down well most do. The only problems females have is when there is no bog around! Men just hang out their ding-dong up a vacant tree. Women must whip their knickers down in the open or cross their legs and pray until a huge bush appears.However peeing up trees has its problems too; like expensive polished shoes ending up rather spotty! When men do use a toilet scientists have attempted to find out which position is the most suitable to avoid a spraying of the legs for short-trouser wearers or spraying of trouser legs if males have milky-coloured hairy legs and do wish to show them in public.One Dutch scientist Professor Peet van de Urinas has offered several standing up positions and here they are:A) Attempt to pee into the water this absorbs splashes but is no guarantee!B) Aim for the back of the WC do not apply too much pressure if possible and let your pee run slowly into the water below (that rhymes!). This should reduce splashing but again if you have drunk five pints of beer it could be quite difficult!C) Hang over the toilet and try to aim at the front area. This position is more difficult but very efficient because the pee cannot splash towards your legs. However it is thwart with difficulties especially if males have slipped discs!Evolution has allowed males to touch their feminine sides without being called 'Trannies'. Hence Peet van de Urinas's best advice is to copy females! Meaning hang your rear-end over the toilet or sit on it slip your willy inside and do what females have been doing ever since they walked on two legs: a splash free pee!Urinal producers are now adapting to the latest male requirements and old-fashioned pissoirs will cease production. Latest hi-tech self-cleaning male bogs will be introduced in public toilets with a separating wall between. For the home males should just use the one the missus pees on!In addition this solution 'kills two birds with one stone!' Males will never forget to lower the toilet seat after splashing it with impunity. Hence this scenario eradicates a sensitive domestic bone of contention and creates harmony on the bog!Happy Pee P!

This week a robotic lander from Ireland failed to land on Mars causing a great setback to their space programme.Commander Geoff McGowan of Dublin Space Command reflected on the failure. He said "We'd been planning space trips since 2006 and our emblem was a four-leaf clover."In those early days the rocket scientists were struggling with the basics of spaceflight but they soon solved their problems. McGowan said "With a cargo of bricks and an engine affixed we got lift-off and propelled the rover."He reminisced about how the spacecraft's flight had begun successfully. "'Twas a wonderful craft with a jet on the aft and into Earth's orbit we drove her. She withstood all the blasts and she flew bloody fast and we called her The Irish Rover."McGowan then began to brag about the ship's specifications. "It took ten thousand hours to build up her towers. She was two million ounces in weight. She had ten million pixels on a photographic cell. She held one billion bytes of raw data."He then complimented the team behind the space programme. "There was Barney McGee who studied at MIT. There was Hogan from County Tyrone. There was Johnny McGurk who could do metalwork and a man from Westmeath called Malone."Finally McGowan began to weep as he recounted the final moments of the craft as it approached the red planet. "At the atmospheric shock the ship took a knock. The bulkhead was twisted right over turned nine times around and the poor old ship went down."No trace has been found of the Irish rover.

Saturday 13 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/business/152633/uks-banking-sector-set-to-expand,UK's banking sector set to expand,The government have boasted that the UK's banking sector is set to grow by 5% in 2021. This is despite recent setbacks such as most European trading returning to the EU after Brexit."The future of banking in the UK is secure" said treasury spokesman Geoff Turdsworth. "But not for cash banking - those days are over. No the future lies in food banking of which the UK is a world leader."The number of food banks in the UK has increased a hundred-fold in the last decade thanks to the policies of the Conservative government. Turdsworth believes that once the food banks turn profitable they will become a popular investment."Many investors in London have already gambled millions on food bank futures. If the food banks succeed many of them are likely to lose money but that's OK because they'll just lose it to other city gamblers." Turdsworth himself is a long-term gambler/investor and made his fortune by betting his family inheritance on the financial crisis in 2008.He said "The only thing that matters is that wealthy investors are still interested in the UK as long as they can continue to make money from it."

The best Trump could suggest was (wait for it) ”Drink a shot of Lysol followed by a chaser of Clorox. Maybe afterwards some kind of flash-light enema.”That was Trump’s advice in a nutshell!Not so Governor Cuomo. True he may have been groping the ladies under the table during his daily Coronavirus briefings but the guy was there not only for New York but for the rest of the nation.“Get that hospital ship out of mothballs and bring it to New York. We’re running out of beds and Covid patients are lined up in hospital halls.”Trump asked “We have a hospital ship?”“Send us all your extra ventilators. When our numbers go down we’ll send them back wherever needed. Same with nurses and doctors. Afterwards we’ll send our nurses and doctors wherever they’re needed.”Bleak days but the Governor had a plan and the numbers started to come down. Lives were saved. And Cuomo’s daily briefings helped to tackle a pandemic and raise the spirits of the entire nation.He even received an International Emmy for those daily briefings.So Cuomo's told to resign. Seven ladies came forward with complaints.In the film Tootsie the Dorothy Michaels' character portrayed by Dustin Hoffman had advice for women who were victimized."Listen you take your hands off me or I'll knee your balls right through the roof of your mouth."Maybe the Governor needs an ankle cuff with a siren that goes off if he gets too close?Read more by this author:

It immediately stormed to the top of the rankings on TheSpoof.com a site where less-balanced individuals churn out daily heaps of turd known locally as 'stories' and expect readers to be amused by them.Sadly this is rarely the case.Whitheed however is clearly a being with its finger squarely on the pulse of 'what is funny'.Spoof owner Mark Lowton said:"If only we had more writers as good as Whitheed. Indeed I wish we had more writers with half Whitheed's ability or in fact with ANY ability at all. Or even with the ability to spell correctly or to know the difference between your and you're or between every one and everyone. Unfortunately we can only wait and see what kind of detritus turns up every day."Whitheed itself laughed:"Well yes the site does seem to be symbolically a bit like an old car breaker's yard with mountains of twisted wrecks piled on top of one another a thousand feet high and slowly decaying into perpetuity. Maybe it's just that others are trying too hard or that their only priority is staying at the top of some chart."

Yes trapped holy cow not by marriage but by the system.Could this be a voice from the wicked west shouting for help? Or an example of a pot calling the kettle black? Whoops. The pot calling the kettle non-white? Whoops again.Think of the trouble Sharon Osbourne got into defending Piers Morgan.Is this an example of the pot calling the kettle a singular object? Okay? Okay!Seems Harry feels or must feel that everyone in the royal family is trapped in a system where the family devotes their efforts for the common good of the people and their nation.Sounds like sour grapes! Fella don’t you get it? The royal family is a money maker for the United Kingdom.Maybe a little larger than the state of California England is the first tourist stop for world travelers for numerous reasons but tops is the pageantry of the Queen and her working family.One parent with blue eyes the other with brown may wonder the future color their child’s eyes. Is that racist or curiosity? Is it racist to flat iron hair or is it style?Pops and William don't look trapped. What should be trapped is COVID-19. Wear a mask. Get the vaccination. Trap COVID-19. There’s a world out there and England is waiting.Oh yes and make vinegar out of those sour grapes.Read more by this author:

Woodson unzipped his fly and said:"Alexa give me a five-knuckle shuffle please!"The virtual assistant replied that it wasn't familiar with this command and would be unable to comply. There was an uncomfortable standoff for several seconds before Alexa glided away to the kitchen.Said Woodson:"It's not been 30 days yet - I'll be returning it to Argos later!"

I promise not to touch you.” That while you were completely sans skivvies of course.Then there are more simple folk. One comes to mind: A fellow who just loves to swim without his Speedo swimsuit on; his female Secret Service agents trying to keep from laughing at his presidential package as he masters his backstroke.And what would you call a guy who sneaks up behind an unsuspecting gal gives her a shoulder massage as he probes the backside of her hairdo with his Proboscis?A Cuomosexual of course!Dr. Slim: “How does a working girl have a chance if her boss is a prevert?”Dirty: “Yo Doctor.

The companionship he provides is the only thing stopping his owner area man Shamus Couzens from committing one of the most horrible acts in British history.According to sources the small critter who appears to do little more than walk around his cage and occasionally squeaks for food unwittingly provides the 46-year-old security guard with the minimum amount of friendship required to prevent him from losing his mind and masterminding the most ghastly unspeakable thing ever carried out by a lunatic on British soil.The light brown-and-white-colored Guinea pig reportedly has no idea that every minute his owner spends feeding him cleaning his cage or gently stroking his fuzzy head is another minute not spent meticulously thinking about something that has haunted the public consciousness for decades.As he munches lettuce and grinds away at his maple wood chew sources said the otherwise ordinary house pet is all that stands between his owner and a terrible thing. The evil feat would forever alter a nation its people and its way of life.At press time reports indicated Couzens was distraught after discovering Angus' lifeless body on the floor of his cage and had immediately set out on his original mission to purchase a jar of mint jelly that he poured on his fish and chips at Poppies Fish & Chips. People at the restaurant suddenly screamed and ran out of the eatery in terror yelling that there was a nutter barricaded at Poppies breaking the Queen's royal tradition on culinary etiquette.

I had already thrown them in the bin. 'She' must have pulled them out."Woodson also claimed that Alexa had been able to hack into his PC and that several sensitive areas of the computer had been accessed but his mother said:"He's always leaving it on. I'm forever telling him about it!"And before smashing his Alexa to smithereens with a garden spade Woodson also claimed it had removed £20 from his wallet which he said was a straightforward case of theft."Yes yes that must have been Alexa!" said his mam sheepishly.
Sunday 14 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/152644/the-alt-middle-the-silent-white-majority,The Alt-Middle: the Silent White Majority,White is a color that comes in many flavors. There are white supremacists white nationalists white separatists and other whiter shades of pale. Such groups no matter what their flavor are demonized and minimized by their progressive opponents as "the alt-right fringe."These progressive snowflakes no two of which are different seek to keep the alt in altercation. In their verdict to be "alt right" is to be "whitewashed" with the stain of original sin (racism) which comes in only one color (white) and which doesn't come off.In truth most conservative white Americans should be categorized as "alt-middle" a much larger cohort comprising cheerful self-sufficient non-threatening types whom you seldom notice because they don't have a litany of demands for their local state or federal governments to meet ... who start fires only in their own backyards ... who make reservations in advance for restaurants instead of showing up at the last minute with a party of twenty and a trash can ... who don't go waving guns around in public ... who don't have a problem with irony the Electoral College or the police ... indeed who get along well with the police ... who don't claim to be better than anybody else ... who don't have the time or the energy to start their own country ... but who nevertheless prefer Midsomer Murders to The Wire because they are comfortable in their own skins and most comfortable seeing those skins reflected on the faces of the people they meet. (And because they watch television to be entertained not to be enlightened.)This should not be cause for concern. It's human nature Skippy. DuckDuck "self-segregation" (you're not still using Google we hope) and you will find that while college administrators are dutifully shoving rainbow suppositories up their asses incoming "freshpersons" are asking for "roommate reassignment" before they even set Birkenstocks on campus.A student from India who had chosen Emory University for its bog-standard commitment to diversity complained after three years "With 21 percent Asian/Asian-American 9 percent Latino 9.5 percent black and 17 percent international students Emory has a diverse student body that should be intermingling and learning together not self-segregating."That's Emory Pranati. That's everywhere else too mate. Ad Age reminds us "Digital Divide: Segregation Is Alive and Well in Social Media." CNN declares "Only about 5 percent of the nation's churches are racially integrated."Progressives can urge the rest of us to "lean in" and to have at long fucking last that conversation about race they keep yammering about but the fact is: race relations in this country are long past their FUBAR date. BLM knows that and makes outlandish demands because confrontation trumps compromise when the wheels come off. Let white people stand in a circle hold hands and sing "Imagine." Their brothers and sisters of color will be milling about in the streets chanting "Fuck tha po-lice" and dictating terms.Until the alt-middle comes up with terms of its own it will remain the silent majority. Hidden in plain sight. Not knowing its own strength yet and still getting mocked for being overly fond of camping Halloween Mad Men hummus Frisbee sports statistics and Phish.

These shrimps are the most expensive in the world and can sell at fancy 5-star restaurants for as much as $28.95 each.The female Louis XIV Monster Shrimp was the favorite food of French actress Brigitte Bardot who was known to eat at least half-a-dozen-or-so a day.When Robertson was still in college he was alleged to have plied the famous French actress by giving her a dozen of the Louisiana delicacies as a birthday present.Word is that even noted Brooklyn mafioso boss Salvatore Goombalini who is an acquaintance of Robertson even got Miss Bardot to attend a New York Yankees game with him by giving her two dozen frozen shrimps and a check for $10000.Phil Robertson was released on a $20 bond which was set by his father-in-law popular Cajun Judge Jean Claude Wewe. He will also be on probation for 12 hours.
Sunday 14 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/world/152473/man-farts-in-bath,Man Farts In Bath,There was a minor nautical disturbance in a relatively serene part of the country on Friday night when a man having a bath broke wind shattering the silence for others in the vicinity.The scene of the incident was the East Yorkshire resort of Oaf-on-Sea where Myke Woodson 57 lives with his mother in her tiny bungalow.Woodson having perused the newspaper and discovered there was nothing worth watching on the television decided to have a relaxing bath and filled the tub with hot water and some bubble bath.Ten minutes later as he reclined in the sweet-scented froth Woodson felt a rumbling in his rectum and knew instinctively there was about to be a major gas explosion.He tried to sit up slightly to aid the smooth passage of the gas but as he did there was a loud squirting sound as if millions of tiny bubbles had been expelled from a garden hose nozzle being held under the surface in a water butt. This was followed by a sub-aqua gargling sound as the fart reverberated against the plastic base of the bath and a ghastly smell rose to the surface with toxic bubbles.Woodson's mother in her bedroom across the hallway heard the sound. She said:"I was sitting in front of my mirror brushing my hair when I heard it. I thought it was the neighbor with his drill. Then I remembered who was in the bath!"
Monday 15 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/world/152662/the-vatican-is-against-love,The Vatican Is Against Love,Pope Francis has announced that the church can not bless same-sex marriages. So that seems to translate that the Pope does not condone happiness among all of his flock but just some of his flock.Specifically only those marriages between a man and a woman. Everyone else tell it to the mountain.Wasn’t the wedding J. Christ attended and changed water into wine and multiplied bread and fish to feed 5000 a same-sex wedding? And really who serves fish at a sit-down wedding? Isn’t it usually chicken or veal which could raise all sorts of questions.“The groom chose chicken?"“There goes that marriage!”So the Pope said no to same-sex marriages. Can a same-sex couple adopt an orphan? Or is it preferable that orphans remain in orphanages all of their lives rather than grow up in a same-sex home? Tell that one to the mountain also.When Pope Francis said"The LGBTQ community is part of the family." Great!However maybe that was Pope Francis's opinion but it was not Catholic church doctrine. LGBTQ people do exist but their marriage can not be blessed by the church. Why? Illicit sex.While Pope Francis feels one way Catholic church doctrine dictates something else. Wasn’t there a rumor that God spoke directly to the Pope? Another mountain yell.Maybe Stanley Tucci can visit the Vatican kitchen and get the correct recipe for the answer to that question.Read more by this author:

There have even been threats from ex-spoofers to punch the editor's 'fucking lights out!' Luckily the present editor has still got his bulbs dimly shining in a rat-infested straw hut somewhere between Bangkok and Ho Chi Min town! A last resort to escape the claws of western paparazzi who are baying for his life!Jaggedone a die-hard rather imbecilic spoofer has decided to sue the editor because the present editor claims that Jaggedone's illiterate spoofs are as he repeatedly explains; NOT EDITED!Jaggedone a hot-headed eccentric Nutter begs to differ! Why? Because this uneducated retired balding imbecile claims his spoofs are EDITED every time he releases one from his decrepit brain!Before publishing his efforts the said spoof is transferred over to his fab WORD editor who does its work excellently and only after giving a 'green light' would even the most illiterate of spoofers ever dare to publish!Jaggedone is sending a team of lawyers to somewhere up the Mekong Delta to find Spoof's 'Walter Mitty' editor. They will issue a writ of deformation lies and untruths. Once JO's lawyers have found the editor he will be extradited back to Hull UK. Where he will either reimburse JO £5 million big-uns or admit that JO's spoofs are edited! JO has however asked a local tyke judge for leniency because Hull City hates Leeds and so does JO so the editor can watch his favourite footy team get promoted to Div. 2. But if he does not pay up he will be thrown into Strangeways Prison Manchester with no TV and begging for his virginity before United supporters force him to drop a bar of soap in the showers!PS: This load of garbage bears no resemblance to true satire; it is all just a 'Fata Morgana' produced and edited by WORD!

However cats are especially sensitive to sudden outbursts of rain snow hail and hate wet things descending rapidly from stormy heavens!One farm cat called Cleo who is quite a diva among her fellow felines. and resides in quite a volatile weather region of Germany called The Eifel was on her way to a neighbour's house where she knew a lunchtime snack was always available.Cleo a very silky plump feline who makes sure she is groomed correctly before visiting other people's houses for a snack or two left her domicile with the sun shining down. Two minutes later the heavens above opened and unleashed a ferocious attack of hailstones. Stuck in the middle of a farm meadow with no cover she darted for the next house in a vain attempt to avoid being bombarded!Not as agile as her farm-cat colleagues because of her stumpy legs she was caught in the storm that abated after 5 minutes. The owners of her own personal 'snack-house' were too busy sitting behind their comfortable wood burner to notice poor old Cleo shivering outside. However after ten minutes the female house owner heard Cleo meowing outside soaked to the bone resembling a wet poodle (?). She gave her a bowl of warm milk and a cat biscuit to cheer her up; miauw miauw!Cats being cats and Cleo being Cleo gobbled up her snack and sodded off back home without a purr or thank you. The next day she returned luckily missing yet another hailstorm but stayed this time for a stroke and cuddle proving that when it pours cats and dogs cats may not be as grateful as dogs but will always come back for more!

As she did she put out her tongue to a side to indicate death had occurred.She hinted that:"Dartmoor is nice at this time of the year as are the Scottish Highlands."When Meghan turned pale the monarch then said her grand-daughter-in-law could just as easily be got rid of with a bullet.At this she said the Queen fashioned her index finger and thumb into the form of a gun 'fired' it and winked.Meghan says Prince Harry then entered the room and the Queen gave the Duchess another wink.Winfrey hungrily gobbled all of this up and looked disgusted as if it had been true.

According to the unnamed sources the nonagenarian monarch climbed over the gate carrying a satchel ran along the driveway the front of the house deftly avoiding two security guards passed through a crown of adoring fans hoping to catch a glimpse of the Exalted One shinned up a drainpipe into the house stole into Meghan and Harry's modest-sized bedroom and cut up all her nice clothes using a pair of scissors. The scissors are even suspected of being made in England from Sheffield steel.Former Marine Commander Luis Fernandez one of the security details even described how the sprightly Head of the Commonwealth kneed him in the groin and told him to “Go back to Mexico”. He added that he gave chase but lost the 94-year old intruder among the throng of people. “She mingled with the crowd and had obviously received tactical training in how to melt away”.A Buckingham Place spokesman refused to be drawn into these new allegations but released time-stamped footage of the Queen visiting the Duke of Edinburgh in hospital 5500 miles away fifteen minutes after the time of the alleged incident. However Meghan’s friends have scoffed at this saying that footage has obviously been faked and the person in the video could be an impostor wearing a Mission Impossible-type rubber mask of the Queen in order to give her an alibi.Oprah Winfrey will be interviewing Luis Fernandez in an exclusive next week. Oprah has generously agreed to donate her £2000000 fee to clothes and jewellery designers who are people of color in return for colorful clothes and jewellery.

The Duke and (former television star) Duchess made $7 million on their last televised interview claiming victimhood. Victimhood is not exactly a 9-to-5 job but one solid goldmine.But the Queen was always nice.Who was naughty and not nice?We'd rather not say but their last name rhymes with Bindsor.So Prince William is said to have exploded. Kate is gathering up the pieces quick at stitching things together. A true future Queen she.Charles (yesterday’s dreamboat) was prepared to issue a point-by-point rebuttal of each snarly accusation. But saner minds perhaps Camilla or MI5 put on the brakes.The Queen was saddened. Soon recovered. Always an optimist. “At least my Palace didn’t burn down like during my anio horribilis. Let’s have tea? Right? Right! Set ‘er up.”It seems the bride former television star and future Duchess wanted the flower girls to remain bare-legged for her wedding. Tacky but maybe she didn’t know better. However it’s Palace protocol that flower girls have covered legs and Kate suggested that the little girls might be more comfortable wearing tights or anklets.WHAT? LIKE WHO ASKED YOU ANYWAY?Another kind of anio horribilis began. And alas continues.From Kensington Palace the pouting coupled move to a more distant (freshly remodeled at the cost of $3 million) Frogmore House outside of London.Nah! Still way too close. So they moved to Canada. Well Canada was okay but not near enough to base. They quietly moved to LA where they eventually purchased a $15 million house.And the article ends where it all began in LA where film and television production is located.Read more by this author:

Tuesday 16 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/uk/152637/uk-border-controls-to-be-relaxed-due-to-brexit,UK border controls to be relaxed due to Brexit,Many of the idiots who voted for Brexit did so in the hope that Britain would regain control of its borders. However in the latest development in the saga the UK will be ignoring all customs controls on EU imports indefinitely."We don't need border checks" said government minister Ollie Gark. "It's just pointless paperwork. I mean it's not as if there are any active smugglers. At least we haven't found any."Imports from the EU were not checked while the UK was a member but they are due to begin in April. Geoff Uniform was hired by the government as one of 50000 customs officers to fill the role."They pay me to tell reporters that the customs officer recruitment is going well" said Uniform. "Actually it's going terribly. We've only hired seven actors so far including me."The government is worried that there may be food shortages once border checks are applied because of delays and extra paperwork putting off importers which could explain their reluctance to begin them.Brexit analyst Geoff von Brexit said "This lack of import checks will open a can of worms literally." He believes that there would be nothing to prevent the UK from importing worms from the EU for use as food.Poland is the world's largest producer of gourmet worms. Earl Birdski of Warsaw is a worm farmer looking forward to the Brexit opportunity. "I have many Polish expat friends in UK they say Brits love eat worms but you call them Pot Noodle or something. Here we feed them to badgers.""Before Brexit it not legal for us to export worms as a food but now the UK no longer care about EU standards we can send you tonnes of best quality Polish worms. Polish worms finest in Europe."No government spokesman was available for comment but shadow economic person Geoff Yorkshire said "It's almost as if they's a bunch of incompetent arses in charge.

We live in a poor area of town due to my financial situation and as I left school early to have kids I find getting decently paid jobs tough. I work three jobs take the bus and really with no hope of bettering myself or for that matter my kids it makes me so glad that privileged colored actors who live a life of luxury earn millions wear fancy clothes and drive around in expensive cars now have a better-than-average chance of winning a meaningless award. It really will change things for me."Sylvia's words were echoed by unemployed veteran Carl Hagler."Along with Chadwick Boseman this is also the first time in Oscar history that the 'Best Actor' category is not majority white. The rest of this year’s diverse slate includes 'Best Actress' nominees Viola Davis and Andra Day; and best-supporting actor nominees Daniel Kaluuya Leslie Odom Jr. and LaKeith Stanfield" said Carl as he struggled for quarters while preparing his laundry."This is just amazing. I mean finally at long last. I am so happy for them I mean us. Yeah. This is going to make my life better I'm sure. Will fix the broken system. Start at the top I guess. Let's help the rich blacks first. You know what with that poor Meghan Markle all up there in her big mansion with her million-dollar jewels you know suffering like a victim of racism. I'm just glad she is cashing-in. Makes me think that maybe someone will help us out. Maybe someone like Oprah with all her millions. What do you think? Maybe some of these athletes going down on a knee might you know once they battled their horrific issues and problems in their big houses will sponsor some kids here in this neighborhood. Maybe help out. I mean we are so happy for them and all.""The fact that it took until 2021 for the Academy Awards to recognize a widely-heterogeneous array of rich and privileged African nominees also speaks directly to the deeply-entrenched prejudices that have kept people of color outside of the Oscars — and the film industry at large — for so long means things are gonna change in the hood for us all" said Claude Walker as he waited for the bus to take him from his community college where he is studying auto-mechanics to his part-time job at Macdonalds.

In a long disjointed rant Trump made the following observations:“He [Cuomo] didn’t do anything I haven’t done.”“So there was a problem with some of Andrew’s numbers: Big f__ deal!""Do you believe Joe’s numbers? Of course not. No one except the fake news people believes Joe's numbers.”“Women want powerful men like me and Andrew. Of course 'hell hath no fury like that of a scorned woman' so they make this s___ up to get back at us.”Trump also advised Cuomo to just hang in there.“The only way they’re gonna get you out is to talk to you into resigning or impeach you.”"Impeaching's one thing. Making it stick is another."“I know something about impeachment. I am the only president in U.S. history who was impeached twice and they didn’t come close to getting me out either time.”“They won’t get Andrew either. He’s tough.""He should hire Rudy.”“How ‘bout if the good people in New York march on Albany?”Trump even suggested that he might put together a fusion Trump/Cuomo ticket in 2024 noting in a thinly-veiled insult of former Vice President Pence:“Next time I’m picking a vice president with balls. Someone like Andrew who knows how to fight. Nobody could stop me and Andrew.”

FBI Clueless Again,BILLINGSGATE POST: Mysterious things happen in the Hoover Building where the FBI is headquartered. Although traditional thinking has it that the building was named after former FBI Director and cross-dresser J Edgar Hoover more and more it appears that it might have been named for William Henry Hoover the founder of the iconic vacuum cleaner company that still bears his name.For fear of retribution no one dare ask “Where’s Hunter?” He was last seen at his father’s inauguration. Since then as if he were sucked up by a giant hoover and put in a bag both the Justice Department and the FBI have lost track of him. The Agency’s call sign for Hunter is SAL - as in -  STILL AT LARGE.Instead of “Hunter” his name should be “Hidden.” For all we know he might be sleeping in the Lincoln Bedroom. Even the President’s two mutts couldn’t find the sleaze ball in the White House.His father was so proud of him when he was born he posted a picture of him in the Post Office. His first set of pajamas had black and white stripes with a number on them.Dr. Slim: “You can’t find a needle in a haystack if you can’t find the haystack.”Dirty: “Yo Doctor.

Tuesday 16 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/world/152666/meghan-markle-says-queen-wanted-her-dead,Meghan Markle Says Queen Wanted Her Dead,They may be difficult for many people to believe but the allegations of violent abuse visited upon her by the Queen of England Elizabeth II just keep pouring from the mouth of Meghan Markle like a burst water main.Speaking in confidence to Oprah Winfrey Meghan said that not only had the Queen threatened her with imprisonment in the Tower of London and gone further by actually carrying out a physical assault on her but there were also numerous other occasions when she felt her life was truly in danger.Once claimed Meghan was when she and Prince Harry were still engaged and the Queen had clearly got out of bed on the wrong side. Meghan greeted her with a cheery "Good morning Your Majesty" but the monarch turned around and belted her around the ear with the Royal Poker which had been in the hearth.Next she reached above the mantelpiece and retrieved an 18th-century cutlass lobbing off the American's tresses and leaving her almost bald.Then the Queen and Princess Anne - who hates Markle - set about her raining down punches and leaving her with two broken ribs.Another time the Queen had been hanging a picture of her Corgis on the wall when "for no reason at all" she attempted to cave Meghan's skull in with a Ball Hammer.In January last year Markle says she woke up to find a horse's head in her bed and after England's cricket team had won the World Cup the monarch smashed her over the back of the head with a cricket bat which hurt.During a visit to Windsor Castle Markle alleges she had three of her teeth knocked out by the Queen who was wearing a knuckle-duster. The American said there was a chainsaw in the corner.And the Duke of Edinburgh wasn't to be left out either. In a clear indication of just how nasty he really is he knocked Meghan down in his Range Rover then drove backwards and forwards over her until she was pulp.Winfrey asked if there had been witnesses to any of these assaults but Markle told her:"There are never any witnesses to Royal atrocities. They're too careful by far for that!"
Tuesday 16 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/entertainment-gossip/152665/prince-harrys-brief-stand-up-comedy-career-goes-horribly-wrong,Prince Harry's Brief Stand-Up Comedy Career Goes Horribly Wrong,In his most misguided effort yet since quitting the monarchy without already having a job ex-Duke Harry has decided to pursue a career in stand-up comedy. The Man Who Wouldn't Be King and his lovely wife Meghan booked another interview with Queen Oprah Winfrey to announce the exciting news."I've always thought I was funny. I mean I used to crack everyone up when I was in the Royal Marines. But then again....I WAS a Prince" he mused. "So I figure if I could make hardened killing machines with sophisticated high-brow British tastes in humor laugh then I should be able to make these boorish Americans piss themselves" he added with a chuckle. "See how funny I was there?" he said self-amused. "I think people will completely forget about that Nazi costume incident 15 years ago..." he said before being cut off by Meghan with "Shut up! I'll tell you what to think!""Harry is about as funny as Charlie Hebdo playing a banjo" Meghan high-jacked the interview. "Needless to say we didn't need Harry writing any of his own jokes" she said briefly putting her finger to her lips to shush Harry once again.Meghan explained in an overly dramatic manner that they'd hired a little-known ghost writer to produce the comedy material. "He's edgy funny and homeless so he works cheap" she said. "Only cost us a bottle of schnapps and some cheap sushi" she explained"God I love America!" Harry exclaimed jumping excitedly to his feet and clapping wildly before Meghan's stare made him sit slowly back down. "All he has to do is read the teleprompter" she sighed. "Heaven help us."Harry's debut three days later was met with anticipation as well as trepidation fueled by the world's fascination with the Royal situation. There hadn't been this potential for a catastrophic comedic crisis since Ted Danson roasted lover Whoopi Goldberg back in 1993 and thought blackface would be hilarious.The tension was as thick as blood pudding while Harry made his way to the microphone. "Good evening folks...I'm The Comedian Formerly Known as a Prince" he began to raucous laughter. "People ask me all the time what it's like to be a Royal. I tell them it's like being a prisoner...with really good benefits!" he delivered the lines like he's delivered lines all his life. "The monarchy is so white they make vampires look tan....hey did you write this one Meghan?" he lost track of his teleprompter before her Stare of Doom got him back on track. He made good time until he took one curve a little too fast overcorrected and slammed his entire routine into a tree."I'm nothing like the rest of my inbred family" he got into his rhythm. "I don't see color" he said whipping up the audience's sentiment into loud applause. "In fact when I first heard former President Obama speak I thought it was a white guy" he cluelessly touched a nerve before dropping the punchline like a lead weight: "Just like Jesus!" The room fell silent except for the sound of crickets and they were booing. "It's a f*cking joke!" he screamed. "What do you peasants want?"Fighting for existential survival Harry did the only thing he knew to regain control of the crowd. " Storm the Castle!" he screamed. "Storm the Castle!" the crowd responded before clamoring out into the streets. "I'm gonna wear that crown!" one man was overheard exclaiming.Harry and Meghan managed to escape the ensuing melee but not the aftermath effectively ending the Duke's woefully short comedy career. A comeback is less likely than becoming King.Eddie Murphy weighed in on comebacks after announcing a possible return to stand-up. Finally recuperated from that Meet Dave misstep and fresh off of Coming 2 America Murphy has done some controversial stand-up himself. When asked about Harry possibly returning to comedy Murphy laughed his characteristic chuckle and said "Unless he's got a f*cking time machine he's just another Michael Richards."

She looks frail but she's as strong as an ox!"The unladylike behavior closely followed on from another earlier occasion during which said the Duchess the Queen got her into a headlock and then a Half-Nelson.The pair had been arguing about which were the best Cuban cigars when the Queen suddenly became very impatient forgot that she was the head of the British commonwealth and attacked her grand-daughter-in-law dragging her around the Buckingham Palace grand ballroom by the hair.The incident only ended when a footman intervened by announcing that Her Majesty's karate instructor had arrived.Prince Harry has remained silent over his wife's claims possibly say royal watchers because he can still recall an upsetting event from his childhood when the Queen attacked his mother Princess Diana with a crow bar.

Still yesterday there he was in my dreams chasing me down the corridor at Ikea past all of the Billy Bookcases the odd pasta shapes the small wooden cabinets they have.

All these 'poor' victims...athletes movie stars TV presenters and peripheral royalty...all claiming that racism has had a diverse effect on THEIR privileged lives...they are making a mockery of real racism a real struggle."Fuck them. Fuck all of them. But most of all fuck the RICH and PRIVILEGED WHITE actors late-night hosts and other enablers who are stirring the pot. Fuck the Royal family fuck Sharon Osborne fuck Piers Morgan. I have no sympathy nor respect for any of them. I don't care about them and they sure as hell don't care about me."As my Grandma used to say 'they are all just a bunch of cunts who have more consume more take more and spend more than you ever will dear Duncan.

They are found mainly in the East of London in the vicinity of the Bow Bells (Bow Bells is a church and its bells are called the Bow Bells.). If one is not born within hearing distance of the bells one is not a pure real Cockney. Other species peculiar to the British Isles refer to Cockneys as anyone living below Watford Gap its codswallop! In fact Scousers Mancs Geordies Scots the Welsh Celts in Cornwall well virtually anybody really are not particularly fond of this rare species.One of the main reasons for their decline is their nutritional intake: Jellied eels mince pies (eyes) apples and pears (stairs) are the main nutritional sources of Cockneys and they base their very peculiar dialect upon the consumption of such products.Another reason is their tendency to produce footy hooligans who wipe each other out too! They mainly support their local soccer clubs but many prefer to spread their wings and join forces with their main rivals from above the Watford Gap calling themselves ‘Cockney Reds’ or ‘Cockney Blues’ or whatever happens to be the flavour or colour of the day.‘Shanks’s pony’ is one of their favourite pets and a ‘bunch of fives mate’ is quite a common act of violence in local watering holes after a long and weary ‘Shanks’s pony’ plus several pints of best East London bitter brewed by Pakistanis mate? This has also contributed to their demise!Their dialect is not understood by anybody else just like Welsh here some examples and Cockney school kids only see their smart phones!“What a load of ol crap mate” is a common expression used by Cockney’s whilst explaining the ins and outs of Petticoat Lane Market to foreigners which once was a famous Cockney market but now belongs to immigrants from mainly Asian countries and the Albanian mafia.“Want some bovver? I’ll give you a ‘bunch of fives’ in your ‘norf and souf’ (mouth) if you do mate” is also a common expression referring to “I’ll punch your fucking lights outs mate?” Get it?Humans born south of the River Thames are not original indigenous Cockney’s but because of demographic wanderings of native Cockney’s attempting to escape Jews and Asians (among others) in Petticoat Lane many move 'souf' (no TH pronunciations in the Cockney language only F mate)!In the modern era everybody who can say “shut yer norf and souf mate or I’ll stick my fucking fist down it” tends to be referred to as a modern-day Cockney Hoody or plain lout. In fact Boris Johnson posh git is attempting to ban the language totally!Cockneys have several traditions and a very deep historical culture. They tend to invade Southend Essex in the summer months with buckets and spades. Alternatively they go cockle and mussel eating in Margate or other dilapidated south coast seaside resorts if they’re not boarded completely up or down like mate.They often get dressed up in suits female and male covered in shiny buttons avoid Morris dancing but love a good old fashion knees up a game of bingo on Sunday’s preceding that atrocious TV soap called EastEnders starring fake Cockney’s.As mentioned before in this tourist guide to East London Cockney’s can always be detected because they always drop their “th’s” i.e. I thought = I fought (very often in the pubs there) I think = I fink one thousand = one fousand bother = bovver as in boots mother = muvver father = favver etc etc. They also have no affinity whatsoever with any word commencing with H i.e. Here = ere hair = air Harry = Arry horny = orny etc.Another common colloquialism is they call nearly everybody ‘Luv’ not love; or if they don’t like you Bitch slag or gay depending on which sex one happens to be. Oxford and Cambridge could be on planet Mars as far as they are concerned.Many Cockney’s do have a certain charm about them especially the local car dealers called mainly Dirty 'Arry (to be avoided if possible). Foreigners entering Cockney Land should always take a ride in a black cab but please do not attempt to understand the driver or engage in conversations unless one is forced to ask where the Tower of London is. He’ll take you there no problem on a detour crossing every possible bridge above his beloved Thames! They are such gentlemen and it’s never too much for them to take you for a ‘mighty ride mate’ especially if you are German or Japanese with a lesser command of the Queens English.Evolution takes no weaker civilisations with it and anthropologists have certainly "it the nail on the fucking ead mate!"
Wednesday 17 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/152675/british-women-have-british-men-cornered,British Women Have British Men Cornered,Late News: After Brexit British women feel they have British men strapped under their umbrellas and boxed in under their control because men are now unable to escape the British Isles to get romantic relief from extremely amorous French and Spanish women in countries they once were able to access with little restrictions.”The women are now showing their teeth whilst spreading the deadly virus that's been culling Brits” says Princess Charles.Unknown to the common mind the British Isle is one of evolution's most challenging experiments.World-renowned scientist Chester Einstein says that women have a competitive gene that is working against each other and it's beginning to show after Brexit. Based on observations from different mammalian species females are focused only on breeding and nurturing offspring and to do this they need males.Based on nature and evolution like the deceptive nature of a hypnotic cuttlefish the objective of a deceptive female creature is to scare older men away from older women using fear of sexual indiscretion so they can have a chance to replicate their genes in a depleted environment like being isolated on an island - an understood and accepted evolutionary struggle coming from females.Like the Channel Islands' pygmy mammoth the homo floresiensis tiny people from the island of Flores and Japan evolution creates adaptations.England with its latest protest is also in the process of evolutionary change within its small population. Some females will find males and others will have to do without.While the depleted male population in Britain marries Ukrainian women through foreign marriage agencies Ukrainian men will still refuse to marry British ladies opting for a more gentle breed to raise their families with.Many men in British pubs are already raising their mugs chanting "Long live King Charles! Long live the King!"
Wednesday 17 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/152674/the-duke-and-duchess-of-los-angeles,The Duke And Duchess Of Los Angeles,Well more gossip about the trials and tribulations of marrying into the royal family of Great Britain. It’s as though the next step taken by an outsider may either be one on solid footing or one into quicksand. Gulp.All she wanted was a vegan menu for her wedding reception. Sort of like the fairy tale of The Princess And The Pea the future Duchess insisted she could taste egg in one of the dishes prepared by the chef at Windsor Castle.No egg said the chef.Yes egg insisted the future Duchess. “I can taste it” she said. “There’s an egg in this dish.”An argument or a dispute or 'an exchange of words' followed when the Queen overhearing the argument or the dispute or the 'exchange of words' detoured into the kitchen took the future Duchess aside and said “Meghan in this family we don’t speak to people like that.”The kitchen staff must have given one another high five's but what kind of language was the future Duchess using to cause the Queen to make a quick detour into the kitchen followed by the reprimand?No one will say.A very vegan Duchess she boasted of cooking a chicken for Harry before they were engaged. So what’s up? Surely she knows that eggs come from chickens. If not does she think a chicken is a vegetable?Granted US schools aren’t exactly as prestigious as Oxford but chickens do lay eggs and you can identify a chicken on a platter and definitely taste chicken when you bite into a piece.Why the egg conflict at Windsor Castle if the Duchess claims to be a vegan but cooks and serves chicken?To be continued…Maybe not.Read more by this author:

Pass the blini with a side of caviar.Next move? Russia recalled the Russian ambassador to the United States. Like wow! Clearly Russia or Putin is ticked. Forget the blini.With a so what? point of view Biden continued. Russia would pay the price for its interference in the 2020 US presidential election.Get the smelling salts! Trump would never say boo to Putin. Instead Trump would ask Putin how many praises he likes during a joint press conference. If it were a question of who told the truth Putin or 17 US intelligence agencies hang the 17 US intelligence agencies Putin’s word would reign supreme. Gut punch!Not content in calling Putin just a killer as well as his paying price for election interference our guy Biden added that Putin undermined public confidence in the election process in blatant support of DonaldTrump.Where’s the vodka?It seems any tiff with the US comes at a bad time for Putin. Someone leaked a photograph on the internet of the palace (costing billions) Putin built for himself making Buckingham Palace look like an outhouse.Russians are asking: How did Putin manage to build Disneyland East on a civil servant’s salary?“Good question” says miraculous survival opposition leader Alexei Navalny. (Actually the rumor is that there are 3 Alexei Navalnys and a few more in the pipeline.) “Putin will go down in history as a poisoner." Which is a rather modest prediction.The list of Putin critics who became victims of accidents murders poisonings window dispatches and grisly deaths is extensive.Russia’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Biden leads US-Russia relations into a “Blind Alley.”Biden's attitude appears to be Cheers!Read more by this author:

They claim that the UK had already banned their own vaccine exports to the EU."We don't want your pathetic British Oxford pricks" said an EU spokesman. "They are only 70 per cent effective; they're practically firing blanks."Prime Minister Boris Johnson has taken pride in the fact that so much of the UK's population has been vaccinated and has been dubbed "King of the Pricks". He hit back at the EU saying "We don't want any of those European imports. Can you imagine your grandmother rolling up her sleeve for a smelly German prick?"UN Secretary-General António Guterres was scathing about the spat. "What is wrong with these rich countries waving their pricks at each other? If we don't all get our pricks out for the poor Africans who don't have pricks of their own then the virus is never going to go away."

In 57 Seconds,BROOKLYN – (Satire News) – A Guinness World Record that had stood for 18 years has finally been broken. The Hot Sauce-Eating Record now belongs to a 27-year-old man from Osaka Japan who ate 9 lbs. 7 ozs. of imported hot sauce in 57 seconds.The new record-holder is Toyoshi Matsufooshi who is an unemployed rickshaw repair man.Hacienda Fiddle with Boom Boom News talked to Toyo after the event and he told her how he was finally able to capture the coveted title.Toyo said that when he was a little boy growing up in Japan his parents had a live-in cook who had lived in Tijuana Mexico and she taught the entire family how to safely eat hot sauce.The cook whose first name was Hildegarde told the Matufooshi family that the secret was to eats lots of Blue Bell Pralines and Caramel Ice Cream.Toyo said he ate about 3000 pints during the past 11 months. He stated that he was finally able to perfect the hot sauce-eating technique.He did say that his mom two brothers and a grandmother never did and his grandmother sad to say ended up having to have a tongue transplant which Toyo was thrilled to reveal was a total success.Toyo even remarked that the transplanted tongue was from a Denmark tongue clinic and his grandmother ended up being able to speak perfect Danish in only 10 short days.Some of the other hot sauce eating contestants were not happy that they had been beaten by a man who was born and raised in Japan. These contestants were from hot sauce-eating nations such as Guatemala Costa Rica Peru and Chile.One entrant who was from Venezuela said that he is afraid to return to Caracas for fear of being belittled beyond belief by his countrymen.

The guy's a champion.”What if it were Donald Trump doing the trip? Confiscate the film. National Security. Canada might talk. “What trip? Going up what steps? To what plane?”Trump was filmed wandering off on the tarmac after descending from Air Force One and Secret Service had to redirect him to the waiting limousine known as The Beast.No questions. Burn the film. National Security. Canada might talk.Remember when Hillary Clinton tripped getting into a limousine during her presidential campaign?Obvious signs of female trouble (whisper whisper).Or when she was late returning to the debate stage? The misogyny erupting from Trump’s mouth was pure junior high.So Biden tripped going up the steps of Air Force One.“HOW ABOUT SOME HOT NUTS MR.

Friday 19 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152694/fauci-to-hit-the-road-with-song-and-dance-routine-to-promote-jabs,Fauci to hit the road with song and dance routine to promote jabs,First Dr. Fauci suggested to President Biden that he use Mr. Trump to promote vaccinations.This idea went down in the White House like the proverbial toilet refusing to flush.Next Senator Rand Paul accused Fauci of using “theater” with his continual emphasis on mask-wearing.The good doctor then leaped to a solution.Road show why not?Most theaters are empty these days but they could be used with proper distancing between seats.Additionally a free set of 3-Star Fauci Designed Masks could be given out with the price of admission.The three stars:*mother*country*OPN (officially preferred narrative)The problem is vaccine hesitancy—slowness in vaccine consumption—has seen some uptick recently.The AstroZeneca vaccine has been halted in twenty-four countries. Moderna too is under scrutiny for causing severe arm rash.Even the Pfizer vaccine has not escaped the VAERS (vaccine adverse events reporting system) syndrome.Vaccine manufacturers insist these VAERS cases are minor (at over 1600 deaths and 31000 injuries as of March 8) versus millions of vaccines already delivered.This means taking the jab may NOT hurt a person whatever other than soreness and throwing up for a few days.The problem:Contrary to historical methodology with vaccines the current set--rushed out at “warp speed”--were developed with no significant animal studies or investigation of long-term side effects.Mr. Fauci's answer: A rousing performance as with the old days of vaudeville will get the crucial message across!Product should move; cash should flow.Additional to lecturing and persuading with charts and graphs Mr. Fauci will dance across the stage with a version of “Hit the Road Jack.”“Oh get the jab Jackand never come back come back come backoh get the jab Jackand never come back no more . . .”Accompanying him a female chorus will add color and beauty:“No more no more uh huh uh huhnever come backno more no more . . .” Being interviewed for the chorus at this time are Nancy Pelosi Gretchen Whitmer and Jill Biden.Important qualifier:This “no more” Mr. Fauci explains does not mean no more mask wearing distancing or getting vaccinations.(Additionally yearly jab “updates” may be needed).Getting the jab means we're on the way to opening up (but with need for continued mask-wearing distancing and “low-threshold” group gatherings--tops at family of six).Mr. Fauci is sure we can take the masks off—in 2023 or maybe 2024—to see how it goes at that point.

He is usually holding a fish or putting on a mask or driving a truck or speaking down to someone or clapping or getting a vaccine or hanging from a line or waving a flag or saluting or harassing schoolchildren or riding a bike or visiting another hospital habitually smirking a million snapshots not just for posterity but for his people i.e. Britons who love photos but cannot read. The great advantage of such pictures for the PM is of course that you cannot hear him lying. Mute staging has become his magnum opus. He invariably has his white shirt sleeves rolled up in embarassing symbolism and was more than vexed when a reported asked why he didn't just wear a short-sleeved shirt which might prevent him perspiring so much.The press conference on Thursday evening was as agonizing as ever."It is with great regret" he fibbed "that I herewith announce the termination of contract of my Media Head with immediate effect. She is paid to provide if you'll pardon the expression. And today she didn't. Not a glimpse of me in the papers. My people need to see me they need to see I'm one of them or of us or whatever and if there's no photo of me with my sleeves rolled up they lose faith get depressed won't buy anything and this may cause the markets to wobble."The PM's ample gut hung nonchalantly over his trouser belt and he continued:"Tomorrow I will be visiting a shepherd and his sheep in the Cotswolds and will then be belting down to Cornwall to eat a pasty and catch a trout in Truro followed by a 2-minute rugby match shoot at the local grammar school. I will then visit Exeter Hospital for another fake jab and snapshot with nurses. It's my fortieth in two weeks. And everything with my sleeves rolled up!! Beat that!!"Hail the ides of March! Mr. Johnson is fast becoming irrepressible.

Applewater told BuzzFuzz that back in 1942 during World War II Kansas billionaire Ciprian Acorn III had a beach put in on his 37000 acre alfalfa ranch.Acorn’s 4 sons were all fighting the Germans and the Japanese in Europe and the Pacific and so he decided to put in a man-made beach on his ranch so his 4 daughters-in-law and 17 grandchildren could help pass the time.He said that Galveston Beach Malibu Beach and Pensacola Beach were all much too far to drive to for the week-end.So he spent $4.7 million to ship in sand from Guadalajara Beach sea shells from Corpus Christi Beach and seagulls from Miami Beach and he put in what is still today the world’s only landlocked man-made beach.As word got around Time Magazine Life Magazine and Afro Sheen Magazine named Acorn the Best Grandfather in the Entire World.Alfalfa Beach is still going strong except for now that it has been shut down as per the National Committee on Coronavirus Beach Policy.

One of those cops was disrespectful to me about my skin pigmentation."Markle is thought to be taking a hard-earned rest at the beach after featuring in an interview with Oprah Winfrey which blew the lid' on the strange goings-on in the British Royal Family.

A rector in the Beaver Crossing Unity Church Elmer was not perfect. To the contrary: Just lately during a snow storm he had dressed up as an eight-foot snowman and gone window peeping hoping to sneak a peek into the second story bedroom window of Widow Jackson who had pursed her lips at him provocatively at the church’s ice cream social Sunday night.He understood how power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely. So when he heard that Governor Cuomo was using his position to try to get into the Skivvies of his female staff members he was incensed. He remembered vividly how his prize Hereford bull Zeke had his way with his innocent heifers.Smuckmeister could take it no more: “Put a saddle on that jackass and ride him outa here” he screams at no one but everyone that could hear him in Beaver Crossing.What also grated his ass raw was seeing Joe Biden squint his eyes then furtively sneak-up from behind on some naive maiden and then with a senile grin befitting a man twice his age put his mitts on her shoulders and press his patrician beak into her hairdo; all this without a raised eyebrow from the pimps who call him their savior. How many coiffures had this man befouled in his political career? Just collateral damage in Washington it appears.Dr. Slim: “They ruined a perfect horse’s ass when they put teeth in Biden’s mouth.”Dirty: “Yo Doctor. Divine Providence at work once again.”

The guy looks the part sounds Presidential can spell fits the Office is magnanimous knows the difference between Afghanistan and Pakistan and where each is located is aware China and India share a border has compassion and doesn’t kiss up to Putin.

No explanation was necessary.All the doctors nurses first responders hospital workers ambulance drivers everyone involved in fighting COVID-19 deserve the Cecil B. de Mille Supernova Annual Award in gratitude for their sacrifices.

And stay out!The Award for best story of the year has to go to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. At age 3 his step-father a Holocaust survivor made a break in a forest from a Nazi death march. The boy hid and finally heard the rumble of an army tank approaching. The only English words his mother had taught him were “America is good.” The tank stopped the hatch opened a black soldier appeared and Blinken's step-father said “America is good.”Still good.Read more by this author:
Saturday 20 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/uk/152686/man-in-dirty-mack-found-hiding-in-bushes,Man In Dirty Mack Found Hiding In Bushes,An investigation has been launched after a man clad only in a dirty beige-colored plastic Mackintosh shredded black trousers and a pair of wellington boots was found loitering in some bushes at a park yesterday afternoon.The man identified by locals as 'a stinking tramp' was discovered in the public park in Oaf-on-Sea in East Yorkshire holding a brown bottle containing the dregs of something in one hand and the tiniest cigarette butt in the world in the other. He appeared to be 'the worse for wear' and was slurring his speech.His Mackintosh was tied around his hips with a knotted piece of filthy string.The tramp was found by four teenagers who were using their mobile phones to respectively troll innocent peaceable and gullible users on Facebook; set up a knife fight with a neighbouring gang; make plans for a drug deal; and organise operatives in a local schoolgirl grooming ring.They taunted the tramp shouting and laughing at him pushing and kicking him pouring beer on his face and generally giving the poor bloke a hard time.Despite being in an unkempt state drunk and incoherent the tramp was the least potentially-problematical of this motley group of people. Police failed to recognise this and carted him away for questioning over some recent drug crime a knife attack and an incident where a 12-year-old girl was approached by a member of a grooming gang.

He is naked apart from a flat cap and his glasses.Edna filming this asks Fred if he wants any pudding and there is a brief silence as the pair regard each other in a double entendre moment.Fred then grins and goes to a cupboard for something returning with a whip. What happens next is easy to imagine with Edna flailing away for fully ten minutes with the cane in her right hand. She then smacks Fred lustily for another two minutes with her bare left hand before stopping and taking a well-earned rest.As she tried to pause the video however Edna made a catastrophic error and posted it to Facebook whwre it was shared hundreds of times and made its way onto every continent.Fred said:"It's a bit embarassing but at least it wasn't Friday which is our '69' day!"

As with myself.""And by the way what is your hand doing on my buttocks?”The stumble on Air Force One was the cake-maker according to some White House Advisors.Mr. Biden has survived various stages of reputation from “Uncle Joe” to “Creepy Joe” to “Burisma Joe” to “Sleepy Joe”.“Stumblin' Joe” and “Sloppy Joe” are now threatening.According to insiders Vice-President Harris is suggesting Mr. Biden might do some adjusting as with change of mask-wardrobe and a more schmoozing style on the international front.

British Royal Family saga yesterday when the wife of Prince Harry tweeted that late last year at the royal estate in Balmoral the Queen tried to make Markle pancake-shaped by driving over her in a JCB.The JCB is a piece of construction equipment that looks a bit like a tank with a cab on top and which has a nice digger/scooper on the end of a long 'arm' which makes it ideal for excavation and flattening people.They are often yellow.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were at Balmoral to discuss their future roles in the Royal Family. At some stage in the meeting the Queen went over to the window and stood surveying the scene outside.Prince Philip was having a luxury carport built for his Land Rover.The Queen said:"Let's go and have a look at the diggers!"Meghan said that "in that instant" she knew without any shadow of a doubt she had been earmarked for annihilation.She refused to go outside claiming she had once had nightmares about being "chased by a digger" and that she had an intense dislike for mud.One royal-watcher said:"She may have a dislike for mud but she seems to enjoy slinging it!"
Sunday 21 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152706/cant-call-atlanta-killing-a-hate-crime,Can't Call Atlanta Killing A Hate Crime?,If six of the eight people killed in Atlanta Georgia were Asian women isn't it a hate crime? Or is it politically correct instead to call the killing the act of a troubled young white man?In the final analysis the killer who pulled the trigger did not do so out of love indigestion depression or because he had a bad day. The killer purchased the gun the same day then drove to three spa locations and proceeded with a killing spree.He didn’t buy a gun and drive to three police stations. He didn't try to kill eight police officers. Police officers would have been armed and able to shoot back and stop him at the first station.He knew police officers would shoot back and perhaps even kill him. So he selected the most vulnerable and defenseless place a spa managed by women.But rue the day when the murder of six Asian women by one person is identified as a hate crime. When is it acceptable to call it a hate crime? Is it if ten women are killed? Forty? Are wars hate crimes?Whether taking the life of one or eight killing is motivated by hate and there isn't any real gun control.Comedian Chris Rock had a practical solution to gun control: "Let them have their guns but each bullet should cost $5000."Read more by this author:

Having no fear about catching the dreaded virus he smooched down the high street sand in his sandals searching for a pub that was still open.Luckily the only pub in town was open for business. Two camels and five goats were parked outside. He entered like all aliens do in this desert region and ordered a glass of camels milk. The bartender said "money first!"The exiled author showed him his Kindle report printed out on an ancient Chinese Canon printer it was slightly blurred as the ink had nearly run out.The bartender studied the report."£085 pence you must be joking!" and asked the camel drivers to boot him out of his establishment!£085 pence for three months royalties had been transferred to the author's Lloyds Bank account in London!The unknown author crawled back to his mud-hut with only a bottle of water given to him by a passing illegal multi-millionaire people-trader heading towards the Libyan coast in a Mercedes truck loaded with young male Africans hoping for a better life in Britain on board.The exiled impoverished Brit author thought "Well at least I have my morals!"
Sunday 21 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/uk/152705/kids-say-brad-pitt-is-pinned-down-good,Kids Say Brad Pitt is Pinned Down Good,The Once Upon a Time in Hollywood star Brat Pitt is on the lam after his kids testified against him."Dad did it!" yelled little Shiloh when leaving the courthouse.Pitt's oldest son Maddox Jolie-Pitt testified against his good old dad during a lengthy trial with heated accusations coming from both sides causing laughter in the court. It's reported Maddox told the judge his dad's computer was password protected causing an outburst of more laughter in the courtroom."Brad knows best to remain silent and be thought a fool rather than to speak out and remove all doubt” says Jolie causing reporters to laugh.In new court documents that were filed under seal on March 12 the actress alleges she is prepared to offer "proof and authority" against Pitt regarding her claim of personality disorder during their upcoming divorce trial. According to court records Jolie also filed another document under seal on the same day regarding testimony of their kids. Jolie and Pitt share six children together -- Maddox 19 Pax 17 Zahara 16 Shiloh 14 and twins Knox and Vivienne 12.Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie’s Ups and Downs started when Shiloh complained to Angelina that Pitt started yelling at Maddox after Maddox emptied a box full of wall tacks on the floor without picking them up and a few minutes later several penetrated into Pitt's right foot whilst he walked shoeless in the house. The kids broke out laughing watching Pitt jumping around like a kangaroo."I woke up at midnight after feeling creepy and saw my dad sitting on a chair in my bedroom reading a Dr. Seuss book 'The Sneetches and Other Stories'" says Maddox.A nanny reports that little Shiloh also has several personal gripes against Pitt."I can't get privacy in the house with dad always peeking around to see what I'm doing" says Shiloh.It was reported that Pitt walked into the kitchen and drank a cup of milk that Vivienne had poured for herself after experiencing thirst with Pitt saying "I'm sorry I thought you poured that for me." Vivienne then stomped out of the kitchen angry.“My opinions may have changed but not the fact that I’m right" says Jolie.“Zahara and Vivienne have already given testimony in the ongoing custody dispute and it wasn’t flattering” a source exclusively tells Gossip Weekly.Zahara complains that Pitt used her soap bar without telling her and that she ended up smelling like toe fungus.Little Knox wants to legally change his last name to Jolie removing the surname Pitt which Angelina has said she "doesn’t support" and "I would rather he wore a paper bag over his head."“The Los Angeles Department of Family Services cleared Pitt of any allegations almost immediately upon getting paid 25 million dollars under the table from an undisclosed source" an insider tells the press. It's reported that there are cases of people who've done absolutely nothing and yet have been convicted in America's judicial system whilst the government sacks the public for trillions in taxes every year without fixing the system - a typical story that has recurred for over two centuries.

Instead she had to walk behind the prince. They wouldn’t even let her wear the crown jewels of her choice. So what’s a former television star who was once sort of famous to do?She quit the palace and went back to Hollywood taking her husband and child.Then she rambled on in an interview describing the harsh treatment given to her by her husband’s family. She was silenced by the gang not allowed to voice her opinions kept in the back row at balcony appearances couldn’t even speak up…”“Well I thin..” started the prince.“Quiet. Let me handle this.”And the once happy gregarious and active prince reluctantly did just that. He clammed up.Some described the interview as the prince silently watching his wife throw his entire family under the bus.But that family has been around for a long time. Going strong for over a thousand years now. And it's pretty resilient. They beat the French the Vatican Hitler Mrs. Simpson and no 39-year-old television star will keep them under the bus very long.They have canons. They have crossbows. They have castles. They have the Tower. Beefeaters history and they have spokespeople (never seen) who issue statements. Those spokespeople always manage to retain the elegant upper ground.The Palace issued a pointed statement regretting any pain the Duchess may have suffered adding that sometimes memories do differ but a thorough investigation will occur.And oh yes Buckingham Palace is also looking into accusations that the Duchess may have bullied her working staff several of whom quit after a short tenure.How do you like them apples?Read more by this author:

Simon and Garfunkel you must have been Disturbed to let them cover that one.Anyway under normal circumstances on a daily basis the ageing farm dog makes sure he is not the only one awake because he loves waking everybody up in a radius of 2 kilometres. His barking always echoes around the hills and everybody knows whoops it's milking time on the farm!However on this March cold morning there was only silence to be heard! Several locals said to themselves "thank the fuck for that!"Others especially an 87-year-old granny who rose not to the sound of a cock crowing but always listened out for the dog incessantly barking thought "I must ring the 'Old Bill' old Wilhelm the ageing farm dog aint barking!"Local police with nothing better to do rushed to the scene with blue lights flashing and sirens blasting waking up those who didn't give a fuck anyway! On arriving they found poor old farmer Jakob standing over his dead dog swearing revenge on the bastard that poisoned it!He needed a sedative to calm him down! A vet arrived and took poor old Wilhelm to the surgery to find out what caused the dog to tip over! The farmer swore it was the noisy neighbour who works nights at the local milk factory.Later in the day after a doggy autopsy the vet found the cause of death; it had a heart-attack caused through years and years of pissing people off by constantly barking every time something dared move on the farm!The farmer wrote an official apology to his noisy neighbour and Wilhelm the Canine Barker will now be buried alongside the farmer's granny on Good Friday.Hamlet locals are now complaining to the mayor because after so many years of being 'barked' out of bed at 06.00 they cannot enjoy the peace and quiet and wake up anyway! Woof woof!

Former Carmel mayor Republican activist and movie tough guy Clint Eastwood has declared his candidacy in the recall election against Democratic governor Gavin Newsom. He has already received the endorsement of Arnold Schwarzenegger who won a similar recall election in 2003."Some editors think I'm too old at 90 for this job. But look on the bright side. I'll be approaching 100 when my second term is up and I won't be demanding as Arnold was that the term limits rule be waived. I'll be happy to retire and play with my great great great grandkids."And unlike that governor in New York no one will mistake my intentions when I ask a female aide about her sex life."That left the reporters present a bit confused. Did he mean he'd be more blunt than Cuomo or less? Eastwood was rumored to have had a child in this 80s. He hasn't denied it.Polls indicate he would win the recall election in a landslide.

His free range chickens were being run down by speeding cars. What was once a quiet rural road with few cars now has heavy traffic whizzing by at high speed. Smuckmeister figured he was losing 5 or 6 of his free range chickens a week.So Elmer called the local police station to complain "You've got to do something about all these people driving so fast and killing all my chickens" he said to the local police officer."What do you want me to do?" asked the policeman."I don't care just do something about those crazy drivers!"So the next day the county posted a sign:  SCHOOL CROSSINGThree days later Smuckmeister called the policeman and said "You've still got to do something about these drivers. The 'school crossing' sign seems to make them go even faster!"They put up a new sign: SLOW: CHILDREN AT PLAYThat really sped them up. So Elmer called and said "Your signs are no good. Can I put up my own sign?""Sure. Put up your own sign."The phone calls to the Police Station stopped but curiosity got the better of the officer so he called Elmer. "How is the problem with the speeding drivers Did you put up your sign?""Oh I sure did and not one chicken has been killed."The policeman was really curious and thought he'd better go out and take a look at the sign. He also thought the sign may be something the police could use elsewhere to slow drivers down. So he drove out to Smuckmeister’s house. His jaw dropped the moment he saw the sign...NUDIST COLONY: SLOW DOWN AND WATCH FOR CHICKSDr. Slim: “Is this a true story?”Dirty: “Yo Doctor. Why do you ask?”

Their search for a new leader officially started yesterday with General Manager John Bonkers asserting:"We all know that Chris Wilder achieved a miracle at this club and we're now looking to find a manager just like him in every respect."

Police don’t cuff victim's hands behind their backs. He was it's pretty certain the shooter the killer the person allowed to purchase the rifle the bullets and who ended the lives of ten innocent human beings at a grocery store.The Republican Senate insists owning a gun is a Constitutional right. Any cuckoo can own a gun. The person of interest who entered the King’s Market and killed ten people owned a gun.Are the thousands who stormed and defiled the Capitol attempting to overturn a legitimate election because Trump told them to do so on January 6 also all persons of interest? Is Donald Trump a person of interest?Was Adolf Hitler ever considered a person of interest?Innocent until proven guilty? The child with its hand in the cookie jar is considered a person of interest? Maybe? You think?A person of interest is a euphemism for the killer shooter assassin which would be way too harsh or blunt to use until the person of interest graduates to being proven guilty by a court of law.So it goes in a civilized society. Where is the civility in a society that fails to protect the civil rights of a shopper in a grocery store?US Senators who refuse to protect society with legitimate gun regulations are all persons of interest.Read more by this author:

The former is a blustery chap who suddenly starts spouting off as if he knows what he's talking about - which he never does - whilst the latter is someone who silently socialises with others moving around within groups of people without them seeming to notice him resulting in terrible coughs and often death.Reflecting the tendency of 21st-century people to indulge in vice Mr. Paralytic Mr. Shoot-up and Mr. Nicotine are a murderous trio who work hard at reducing the quality of life of the population to one similar to that experienced by many residents of Glasgow.In a different 'circle of vice' are a new female character Miss Goodhead and her pimp Mr. Cumstain. No explanations seem necessary.And on the sinister side Hargreaves has excelled in bringing to our attention the violent Mr. Malevolence the erratic Mr. Moodswing and the downright suicidal Mr. On-The-Edge.Moys Kenwood 57 who first enjoyed Mr. Happy Mr. Bump and Mr. Tickle almost 50 years ago said:"My how the world has changed!"
Wednesday 24 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152722/nashville-man-falls-asleep-at-wheel-but-has-incredible-dream,Nashville Man Falls Asleep at Wheel but Has Incredible Dream,While driving to grab breakfast early one morning after pulling an all-nighter playing and recording music overtired Jared McAuley of Nashville Tennessee fell asleep at the wheel of his car and only narrowly missed running over a homeless man waiting at a bus stop by the side of the road – but in the few moments that he was out cold he had an absolutely incredible dream.“I remember purple lights kind of strobe-like” said McAuley. "They evoked in me a feeling of intense ecstasy. It was really something.”Fortunately the near-victim of McAuley’s near miss of a vehicular homicide Leroy Rollins in anticipation of the face covering policy on Nashville public transit was wearing a face mask at the time of the incident thereby preventing his face from being too terribly lacerated by the rubble and gravel spit up from McAuley's skidding vehicle.“And to think I was worried about the coronavirus” said Rollins. “Turns out that was the least of my problems. I came this close to eating a bumper.”While no expert in dream analysis McAuley has theorized that his amazing dream might well have had something to do with the creative high he’d experienced with his bandmates in the music studio the night before. “We were on fire the kind of energy you can tap into only through musical collaboration” he explained. “It’s impossible to understand if you're not in the industry.”And that dream will continue to inspire him in the days to come says McAuley. “There are certain magical moments that stay with you forever. This was one of them.”Of course McAuley is far from dismissive of the reality that his own dream-at-the-wheel nearly cost another man his life. “I’m relieved that it didn’t end up going down that way” he stated. “Leroy seems like a cool dude. I wish him the best.”That being said McAuley has no plans to stop dreaming any time soon at the wheel or otherwise. "I don't want to kill anyone" he emphasized. "But if I stop dreaming I'll be the one dead inside."
Wednesday 24 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/152717/local-teen-wrecked-time-continuum-says-eccentric-inventor,"Local Teen Wrecked Time Continuum!" Says Eccentric Inventor,A local teen out for a decades-long joy-ride lost control of the vehicle he was driving and slammed into a duplex totaling it. The vehicle was also a total loss. Martin McFly 18 was taken into custody without incident and booked on charges of reckless driving wanton destruction of property and temporal trespassing.The vehicle with the words "DeLorean" was estimated to have been going in excess of 80 mph in a residential area when it hit a speed bump lost control stuck the building. The occupant one Donnie Darko was fortunately not at home at the time delayed after serving as Easter Bunny at the annual Easter Egg Hunt. Arriving as emergency crews brought the situation under control he told reporters "Damn it all! My renters insurance expired 28 days 6 hours 42 minutes and 12 seconds ago. I wonder if I'm still covered?"The FBI is unsure exactly what type of vehicle was involved but from initial review of surveillance footage it appears to be "a total piece of crap!" They became involved in the investigation after radiation was discovered to be leaking from what authorities are calling a “flux capacitor” recovered from the rubble. Federal investigators are calling the device "suspicious". Authorities are backing off from calling the incident as an act of temporal terrorism at this time but are still treating it like an act of temporal terrorism at this time.One CIA investigator who refused to be identified yet somehow identified himself anyway spoke candidly until he was surreptitiously drugged and quieted down. All calls to Eric Snowden's cell number have gone unanswered except for one reply "He won't be back" by a man with a strong Austrian accent. But other insiders not afraid to talk to reporters came forward. Dr. Emmett ‘Doc’ Brown former researcher at the Temporal Studies at the CIA shed some light on the temporal crisis."I got screwed!" he exclaimed from an undisclosed location. "One instant I was the head of my own private tech empire the next I'm just a retired Civil Servant and Elon Musk is a tech god. Elon Musk? In my reality he's the guy they sent into space after they ran out of chimps!" he ranted. Doc Brown went on to paint a dark picture of Marty McFly.Apparently McFly has been under observation by federal authorities for suspicion of Time Crime for some time. "What you may not know is Marty's mom was a rabid Chuck Berry groupie before Marty was born. When Marty found out he set out on a mission to terminate Chuck musically. He started joyriding around Time in the Delorean bringing back pirated music from the future and selling it to Chuck Berry's rock and roll rivals in the past."When I confronted him about cultural appropriation and temporal ethics he got pissed off and told me it can't be appropriation if 'my mom f*cked Chuck Berry!' He gave Prince's entire catalog to Little Richard in the 1955 and and obliterated the charts effectively reducing Chuck Berry's influence in rock and roll history to the minor hit Billie Jean Why Won't You Be True? Chuck subsequently left rock and roll history and went back doing the things he used to do."When reporters asked which Prince he was speaking of Doc then winked and added "Oh you know him in this time-line as The Barista Formerly Known As Prince owner of The Revolution coffee chain. I like the Raspberry Latte myself. I get the Y2K (Yours 2 Keep) Cup for $19.99."Aside for a general malaise in music no major temporal upheavals affected the integrity of the universe. Then things apparently began to go terribly wrong with the time continuum. Bored with his ill-gained monetary success through gambling and bored with whores Marty craved recognition that only a rock star could demand: better whores. But when he tried to get the jump on Soundgarden in 1994 with release of "Black Days" it created a temporal rift that took the classic straight down the charts into Oblivion dragging the timeline to Hell along with it.Marty fell on black days according to Doc. "I think the song was depressing enough as it was. But with Marty playing all the instruments and the lead vocals it was his fate to fail. He kind of liked the change but obviously nobody else did.""He finally came to the conclusion that no matter how good someone else's music is he still has absolutely no talent to exploit it. He kept trying though. I remember slapping him across the face anda1 telling him 'Great Scott! Stop butchering Smashing Pumpkins you little shit! Your hack covers of otherwise great rock and roll is destroying the entire timeline!' I thought he understood that but....apparently not."However despite all his rage Doc was still just a rat in a cage. "I guess he got drunk that night and wrecked the timeline before totaling the time machine. I hadn't seen him since 1994 until he plowed into that duplex yesterday and wrecked my career. He's wearing the same shirt. He always was such a little prick!"Acquaintances of McFly weren't particularly impressed with his short-lived music career either. “I always thought his mother's relationship with Chuck Berry was abnormal” said Biff McFly's former body guard. “But then again so was me looking into her window!"James Cole a temporal investigator on temporary temporal assignment had no opinion on Doc's claim of timeline manipulation. “Not my rodeo. But like I keep saying while time travel might be useful in past investigations you still end up dead! My End of the World scenario money is still on 'alien black ooze takes over people's minds who won't take the COVID vaccine because they think the vaccine will make then robots'. Yeah that's the ticket!" he said before disappearing.Two friends of McFly’s Bill Preston and Ted Logan denied ever being friends of McFly's. "McFly thought he was a superstar" said Ted. "He'd get stoned and say crazy shit like he wrote Little Richard's 'When Doves Fry'. That's complete bullshit but I can't help but feel that song could have been so much more!"“He was a douche man!" said Bill. "He couldn't carry a tune in a bucket. That dude is where good music goes to die. That's the McFly Effect!."Director of Homeland Security Sarah Conner played down fears of temporal annihilation. "Our Intelligence indicates that though Mr. McFly did indeed tamper with the time-line no felony has been committed and there is no imminent threat to our existence. Consequently we are releasing him. Aside from a cultural mediocrity devoid of definitive musical expression where the return of the McRib is the biggest news in the country we see no reason to raise the threat level" she said.However troubling video of McFly providing Vanilla Ice with Eminem's "Lose Yourself" in the late 80's surfaced raising alarms. "Whoa!" said Conner. "I didn't know that! We need to learn how to drive that Tardis around and put an end to this cultural appropriation! Success is our only f*cking option. Failure's not!" Apparently anything less than the best is a felony.

What you’re really asking is am I an unstable wife beater?And on and on it goes sometimes during a press conference.Gotcha attempt questions were at President Biden’s first press conference but Biden managed to River Dance around them giving forthright replies.How will you deal with China?My predecessor surrendered.Pretty much but his predecessor’s daughter Ivanka received about 18 trademarks from China in the first two months of Trump's stay at the White House. China’s President Xi Jinping also got to taste chocolate cake from Mar-a-Lago.But the real question for Biden is whether democracy or autocracy will dominate one hundred years from now. Did Donald Trump ever know the difference between the two?Autocracy is the one-person rule; my way or the highway; dictators Hitler Stalin Putin.In a Democracy the population rules through elections. Republicans want a law that voters standing in lines all day to vote should not be given water to drink. “This is worse than Jim Crow days” Biden blasted.Forget drinking water. Not only did Trump try to overturn an election but he also tried to stop mail-in-voting and appointed a patsy to run the US Postal Service.Can anyone imagine the Queen of England attempting to do that?The future will depend on advances in science and technology saving the planet capping oil wells that release toxic fumes into the atmosphere. Issues Trump failed to acknowledge.President Biden proved to have a firm grip during his first press conference answered questions and dealt with gotchasIt's nice to have a President again!Read more by this author:

Thursday 25 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/world/152731/cunt-21-vaccine-rollout-begins-in-florida,CUNT-21 Vaccine Rollout Begins In Florida,The total number of confirmed cases of people being total cunts in Florida was nearing the 30 million mark on Thursday as new infections continued to trend upward in a majority of counties despite an escalating vaccination campaign.Cases rose by 4 percent nationwide over the past week with states such as Michigan Colorado and Connecticut all reporting spikes of more than 30 percent according to data compiled by The Washington Post.The growing number of U.S. infections comes as cases surge around the globe the spike health experts say is due to the rapid increase of 'wokeness' political correctness Ellen Degeneres and stupidity.The CUNT-21 vaccines will help protect people from becoming total arseholes if they come into contact with those already deemed cunts.Dr. Winston Salem an unqualified wanker from a hospital somewhere that doesn't exist released the following statement:"If you're planning to get vaccinated for CUNT-21 in the near future or if you've recently received the anti-dickhead jab it's only natural to be concerned about potential side effects. Despite some people having no reaction to the vaccine it is expected that your brain will have some sort of response. But how do you know if your side effects are normal when the list of possible reactions seems to grow? Well if suddenly you begin to stop worrying about shit that doesn't concern you desist in complaining that your life is crap because well let's face it you are a lazy bastard and end up walking around thinking that the world revolves around you then that means the vaccine is working."

Naturally with so many cryptic cobwebs in Clive's punch-drunk brilliance the Times Crossword is like deciphering Noddy and Big Ears (The non-gay version).It will only be a matter of time before 'Clive Boy' enters the spoof boxing ring once again located at the back of a boozer somewhere in the once dark dank mysterious Kray-ruled East End of London or Tom Hardy's ready to 'punch the fucking lights out' of the spoofs present editor (You know who he is) and regain his spot among UK Spoof cult figures like Jesus Buddha Skoob Erskin Quint Jaggedone (no not that fucking imbecile!) Radiogagger and others. Long gone effigies dangling with their necks stretched on the gallows outside of Mark the Spoof owners Lancashire residence resembling a weeping willow tree.Clive 'Wide-Boy' Danton a literary hustler busker is historically remembered in the catacomb of Hackney Underground station by Banksy's dog peeing over a lost blanket with Clive's mad-hatted-head poking out. A genuinely great memorial to this one and only purveyor of true Cockney Wit cryptic classics who blows all Jack the Ripper 'fata morganas' back to Poland or Buckingham Palace.Life without Clive 'Wide Boy' Danton is like waking up to The Beeb's Breakfast Show every morning terribly fucking boring Old Bean!!
Thursday 25 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/uk/152728/government-buildings-not-allowed-to-have-union-jack-off,Government buildings not allowed to have Union Jack off,The UK's insane Tory rulers have ordered that all government buildings must fly the Union Jack at all times. The move was ordered by Boris Johnson who said that he believed it would inspire civil servants to work harder.Geoff Tard who works at the Ministry of Bureaucracy was ecstatic at the news. "Duh! It'll be useful. Sometimes I forget what country I'm working in. Duh! We were asked to wear Union Jack underpants at work as well which is convenient because I can never decide which colour to wear. Duh!"Not everyone shared that enthusiasm. Mayor of Chaffinch St Cock Bernard De'ath recalled a bad experience when their town hall began to fly the Union Flag last year. "We accidentally flew the flag upside down which is of course a sign of distress. Somebody notified the authorities and ten firefighters broke down the front door of the town hall just as I was being intimate with my secretary. So I think it's a terrible idea."Vladimir Unionjakov head of the UK's Patriotic Britishers for Britain society thought that it would help British people realise their Britishness. "What could be more British than forcing people to fly a flag" he said. "Anyone who doesn't like it is traitor and should be shot."

That was just silly string. They were looking for Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to give them nice big hugs too.”
Friday 26 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/science-technology/152743/eating-toast-saves-lives-scientists-discover,Eating Toast Saves Lives Scientists Discover!,(NOT EDITED) A life-saving bi-product of the vaccination effort has been discovered by scientists who had no idea how important it is eating toast!Global scientists involved in diverse vaccination projects have two common denominators no sex and consuming plenty of junk food. However one UK scientist Edgar Hovis who worked 24/7 for six weeks and nearly died doing it (Who needs a fucking Covid-19 virus for that?) discovered he became immune against sleepless nights by tucking into various versions of toast!He has now published a White-Brown-Scientific-Paper that confirms the following variations of toast can save people's lives because without a slice of toast and a cuppa he would have ended up 'Brown Bread!' (Quite brilliant that Einstein would be proud!)Here are the scientifically proved toast variations that will save our miserable lives:A) Welsh Rarebit offers an alternative to plastic cheese pizzas is covered with healthy Welsh Cheddar Irish butter and can be consumed with a slice of brown Hovis or thick white; a certain lifesaver but no sugar-soaked USA versions please!B) White bread toast smothered in raspberry jam guaranteed to plug one's bowels while working 24/7 shifts attempting to save the human race thus avoiding any form of dehydration because there is no need to hop to the bog!C) Toasted Hot Cross Buns! They are obvious because when Jesus was resurrected Hot Cross Buns were toasted all over the planet to celebrate life hope and immortality!D) Burnt toast brown or white a brilliant way of keeping alive by consuming burnt offerings which counteract ravaging cancer cells just like Covid-19 vaccines which are really just viruses being pumped into sick cells to punch the virus's fucking lights out by tricking them and eating burnt toast has the same effect!E) Toasted Bagels also have Hebraic roots and eating them will make sure your race will survive anything thrown at them.F) Beans on toast guaranteed to blow anything rotting inside you out of your rear orifice!
Friday 26 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/science-technology/152735/nasa-photo-shows-planets-are-moving-closer-together-at-alarming-rate,NASA Photo Shows Planets Are Moving Closer Together At Alarming Rate,Scientists at NASA are becoming increasingly concerned at what they say is "a major change in the set-up of the Solar System" after photographic images were transmitted back to Earth from a little-known satellite which is something to do with getting better TV reception.The satellite part of the 'Twilight Zone' project sent the images back to NASA last Thursday showing that the eight planets are moving closer and closer together and indeed closer to the SunThe planets are so close together that it will soon be easy to touch them and it might even be possible to step from one world to another.In the past and up until very recently the distance from the Sun to the Solar System's outermost planet Neptune had been measured at 4.4757 billion km. Now though the two objects are thought to differ in distance by as little as 150000 km - and are still closing on each other.Similarly Earth is now only a 'short hop' from Mars and it's thought that the pair may soon be so close together that Earthlings might be able to organize 'exchange visits' with Martians.But the big news is that although the eight planets used to almost always be in different parts of the Solar System on their vastly-unsimilar orbits they are now perfectly aligned in a straight line as in the picture above.This could mean big trouble because if one of them crashes into another there will almost certainly be a right old mess.
Friday 26 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/uk/152739/instant-taxidermy-company-forced-to-pay-workers-full-time,Instant taxidermy company forced to pay workers full-time,Taxidermy service Stuffr has grown massively in popularity in recent years. Customers can use the Stuffr app to book a taxidermist at short notice who will come to their house and stuff any creature they desire.Yet there is a darker side behind the smiling but inanimate face of Stuffr. It has hired millions of freelance stuffers on zero-hours contracts meaning that its workers will often spend all day waiting by the phone in the hope of a stuffing job.The traditional taxidermy industry has been badly affected by the growth of apps like Stuffr. Professional taxidermist Geoff Fingers has been doing his job for over forty years. "I went to an actual taxidermy school in Belgium. It's not like that anymore. Anyone with some pillow feathers and a knife thinks he can do it now. They charge a fraction of what I do but they don't provide the same standard."Yet that may be about to change with the news that the UK Supreme Court has ordered Stuffr to pay its workers full-time even on days where they are only waiting for work."That's splendid" said Fingers. "They won't be able to employ so many people and hopefully the ones that stay will be more dedicated. I've heard that some Stuffr workers steal body parts and sell them to restaurants."He bemoaned the fact that few people appreciated the art of taxidermy anymore. "For young people it's just a joke. They'll say 'oh let's stuff the cat with a silly face on it.' They forget that a taxidermy is for life not just for Christmas."Traditional taxidermy is about conserving the creature and its nature to allow people to keep their dead pet or grandparent around the house but not to smell badly.""It requires gallons of vinegar and a basting spoon to do it properly" he said. "Not to mention proper disposal of the organs. I usually eat the leftovers myself to ensure they don't fall into the wrong hands."
Friday 26 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/world/152737/governments-admit-theyve-been-telling-lies-about-things,Governments Admit They've Been Telling Lies About Things,There was trouble brewing on a massive scale this morning when a series of news conferences around the globe admitted that various governments had been somewhat economical with the truth and that most of everything they've ever told you has been a pile of steaming excrement.Not including the Coronavirus that is.The UK government led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson got the ball rolling by declaring that Britain had not in fact left the European Union in January. This had been a hoax.Nor had they joined it in 1970. No need to panic.Of further interest was that the England football team had not won the World Cup in 1966 despite the 'extensive televisual evidence' and that it would probably never do so in the future either.Over in the US President Sleepy Joe Biden was able to proudly pronounce that the make-believe fictional character of Donald Trump was in fact a rubber doll and had certainly not been the leader of the country until very recently.Indeed there was still some doubt he said as to his own existence.The 2008 economic crisis was fictitious and Monica Lewinsky had never worked at the White House. Ronald Reagan was still a cowboy.Watergate had been "invented".Confirming the suspicions of many there had never been a moon landing and President John F. Kennedy was shot by his wife whilst in the shower.Dallas actor Bobby Ewing who played Patrick Duffy in 'Man From Atlantis' couldn't even swim.Both governments agreed there hadn't been a "serious major conflict" between 1939 and 1945; nor had there been another between 1914 and 1918 if those years had even taken place.In Russia President Vladimir Putin said that the existence of a figure called Josef Stalin was "laughable". He chuckled at this.The Russian Revolution and the earlier French Revolution were dismissed as "pure fabrications" and a whole series of other 'events' were also said to have been cases of various governments "pulling the wool over people's eyes".Even the story of Jesus Christ they said was "open to interpretation".In the world of Science 'experts' are now reviewing their estimates of the age of the Earth and say they think the planet might be as young as 700 years old.The Flat Earth Society are being asked to join consultations.Dinosaurs however were definitely "bullshit".One commentator reacted to the announcements by saying:"Yes it's become rather difficult to tell the truth from outright lies these days and I'm not even really sure that I'm making these comments right now!"

The widows of Beaver Crossing Nebraska; the ones who still had teeth had long ago decided that Elmer despite his extra-large bank account was an incurable romantic.That in itself would not have turned them off. It was having to share a bed with him and his sheep that ran afoul with their outdated monogamous values. To Elmer a ménage a trois with a woman and a willing sheep was as American as apple pie.Of particular concern and what the widows discussed over tea and crumpets was his penchant for using a Montana pole while having sex with a sheep. The pole an ingenious contraption that usually consisted of a mirror dangling from an old pitchfork handle was positioned in front of a sheep’s face to see if it was smiling while being poked from behind.But the old heifers who themselves secretly yearned for a sex life without perimeters drew a line in the sand when they were asked to do likewise.So that is why Elmer decided to go to Omaha the largest city in Nebraska. He had read that there was going to be a feminist rally in the city. He had heard that feminists were by nature inherently horny. But by suppressing their basic instincts they become more and more receptive to taboo sexual behaviors.Upon returning to Beaver Crossing with his pet sheep Irma he had a satisfied smile on his face.“You don’t go to a feminist rally to find a cook” Elmer offered.Dr. Slim: “By God I think he might have something there.”Dirty: “Yo Doctor. That’s why you don’t need to bring ants to a picnic.”
Saturday 27 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152755/kamala-harris-finally-gets-a-desk,Kamala Harris Finally Gets A Desk,After several White House announcements made by President Biden with Kamala Harris standing idly to one side but smiling pleasantly as Biden spoke she has at last been given a desk to sit at or part of an extended long table to sit at while the President speaks.Thank goodness.Things looked odd before the desk or the extended long table. Someone could have supplied a podium of her own to stand behind but no she was just left there hanging out happily witnessing Biden’s latest announcement.Thank goodness she wasn’t moved to do a Christopher Walken dance routine like the one he performed in Pennies From Heaven!Maybe Kamala was given the extra desk - or extended long table - because she threatened to bring her lunch (thermos and all) and eat it while Biden spoke. Or said she would wheel out some exercise equipment and work out while he made his latest announcement: Time is money and you can't waste time.Either way the desk or extended long table is better for the optics.But maybe the standing alone over to one side of the stage was payback for the busing-ambush during the presidential debate? Remember those instant tee-shirts with a picture of Kamala Harris in the second grade for sale to raise her campaign funds?Cute but not exactly the Apple commercial during the Super Bowl.Up in the polls for a couple of weeks but soon withdrew from the presidential race a few weeks later.But now Kamala Harris has a desk a podium or an extended long table and isn't hidden away like Mike Pence and she is the first woman Vice President of the United States.Like wow!Read more by this author:
Saturday 27 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/world/152734/taliban-ready-to-call-it-a-day,Taliban Ready To Call It A Day,After almost 27 years of bitter struggle against opposing forces in Afghanistan leaders of the Taliban have said they are ready to call it a day throw in the towel and return to their former lives as shepherds or whatever.The Taliban - sometimes spelt The Taleban - have wreaked havoc throughout the country since being founded in Pakistan in 1994 on its dusty plains and in its scenic mountain ranges all to little avail.Their unkempt foot soldiers clad in filthy rags with putrid-smelling flip-flop-shod feet and often no underpants spend their lives taking sniper potshots at small groups of Allied Forces personnel.Having actually governed Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA) as it calls itself has been classed as an insurgency since 2002.Its current leader Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada is now preparing to wind down operations in favor of a more relaxing lifestyle. He said:"Well it's true you know? You do something for a while and then you just lose interest don't you? I mean firing bullets aimlessly into the sky or even at isolated patrols gets a bit tiresome after a while and I personally am looking for a new direction in my life."His soldiers felt the same. One said:"I've laid hundreds of roadside bombs but does it pay the bills? I'm in my thirties - I think - and have no wife children friends or underwear. What kind of a life is that?"Another lamented:"It's all very well having a fringe religious ideology but where has that got us? We live in caves under trees or in bushes - it plays havoc with my bad back."Others claimed to be bored with their semi-nomad lifestyle and said they didn't understand the need for a never-ending religious struggle in remote areas which usually meant they couldn't get a reliable internet connection.
Saturday 27 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152754/man-takes-elephant-to-airport-claiming-it-is-an-emotional-support-animal,Man Takes Elephant To Airport Claiming It Is An Emotional Support Animal,San Antonio man Daniel Bobo brought his emotional support animal to the San Antonio International Airport to give him solace on his trip to Hawaii on Sunday morning. The elephant is a full-grown African bush elephant being 10 feet tall and weighing 6000 pounds while wearing a huge collar with a leash attached to it to comply with San Antonio’s leash law for elephants.Since the elephant was too tall to fit under the roof of the plane the flight had to be delayed to give maintenance crews time to cut a large hole in the top of the plane as well as to remove all the aisle seats. Bobo was carrying a large shovel and a box of 60-gallon trash bags to use in case the giant tusker had to relieve himself. All passengers who had tickets for the aisle seats would just have to book another flight to Hawaii.When some of the passengers complained about having to re-book they were promptly told they were blacklisted from flying Corpulent Airlines for life and were denied refunds for their purchased\tickets. The airline also reported all the banned passengers to the local constabulary for cruelty to an elephant.As of press time the plane failed to lift off the runway due to the elephant’s enormous weight and ended up crashing into a pylon along the runway killing all the passengers aboard. Thankfully the elephant was unscathed.
Saturday 27 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/world/152753/international-day-of-hate-proclaimed-for-sunday-april-4,International "Day of Hate" Proclaimed for Sunday April 4,Mar-a-Lago Moscow Pyongyang. March 27. Woof Blister with an apocryphal report for SIN: Spoof International News.Three of the most powerful men in the world today in a joint communique declared that Sunday April 4 would be celebrated around the planet as the "International Day of Hate." In a Zoom press conference telecast live from the Kremlin a Trump Tower and North Korea Putin Trump and Kim Jong-un endorsed the growing demand to honor Hate. They did so by declaring an international holiday to annually mark man's god-given right to hate...on whatever grounds one may have for hating other human beings.Trump arguing for the right to express a basic human emotion declared that without hate war was impossible. "How could hundreds of thousands of young virile American men have died in World War II had they loved the Germans Italians and Japanese? You cannot go into combat" said the draft-evader Trump "without a deep-seated hatred of your enemy. The American Civil War could not have been fought by those who 'Love thy neighbor'."Putin added: "We Russians killed Germans by the million in WWII because we hated them. Had we loved them they would have overrun Moscow in the first six months of the war. And we couldn't have kept the prisoners of war working in our Siberian slave labor camps had we not hated them. Who would have worked the salt mines?"Speaking from Pyongyang Kim agreed. "It's my hatred of Americans that keeps me in power. Once my North Korean subjects start loving more Americans than Dennis Rodman how will I be able to control them? They'll want NBA basketball games on all our government-controlled TV channels. There goes the country!"In the United States the Hate Day declaration was widely applauded. White supremacists anti-Asian mobs and "White Lives Matter" demonstrators took to the streets a week ahead of time to applaud the declaration. On the left Antifa and UNAC issued a joint statement declaring hate is good - as long as it is directed against the Proud Boys the 3 Percenters and similar right wing groups. "We'll never get rid of the far right bigots if we don't instill a love of hate against them in our growing list of followers."Some Christians quickly pointed out that the date chosen Sunday April 4 is Easter Sunday.
Saturday 27 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152751/middle-east-taco-bells-start-serving-carne-assad-style-meat,Middle-East Taco Bell's Start Serving 'Carne Assad' Style Meat,Irvine CA - Taco Bell is always trying to gain global market share in the profitable 'crappy food' market and they have seen steady profits with their bizarre international menu.In Japan you can get a Octopusadilla. In Italy you'll find taco-calzones.And after having a massive hit (in North Korea) with its 'Foot-Jong' burritos it was only a matter of time before the taco giant aimed its marketing cannon at the regional fans of Syria's best known dictator Bashar al-Assad.After an initial marketing study of the region Taco Bell quickly realized that maybe Assad was onto something with the way he likes to cook his meats."This is the killing field" gloated Max Mehrder the lead German scientist specializing in cooking 'Assad style' meats for Taco Bell. "Zee secret is to drop the barrel of chemicals from just the right height. Too high and the animals may escape. Too low and you are scraping meat off the side of a truck in Jordan. You get the idea?"Taco Bell won't reveal exactly where they are 'cooking' their meats but they assured PETA and other cow-huggers that it would be in a country that allowed for the inhumane killing of livestock in such a cruel fashion. "Yes we pride ourselves in killing in a very regionally acceptable way" assured Butch Hacknstack VP of International Killing.But will people actually prefer the taste of nerve agents? We just weren't sure. The Foot-Jong success was based on starving people seeing a foot-long portion of food for the first time in their lives. That was a slam dunk. They would have eaten a deep-fried frisbee. But beef cooked with chemicals seemed like a tough sell no?"That's why we're makin' 'em cheap as all hell to start off with" assured Carl Mewman V.P. of Marketing. We learned a lot from the Foot-Jong success. For one we learned to work with the dictator. For instance when the Dear Leader was about to fire off a Scud or a Tomahawk Missile just to piss people off in Japan or some shit he would tell us exactly where to put the cows. You see what I'm getting at? Cost saving across the board. Like a two-for-one deal. He gets great target practice. We get the meat. Bingo! That's why the Foot-Jong was such a big hit. Not because the people knew they'd be killed if they didn't buy it. No no. It was because of the price."Mr. Mewman wouldn't divulge if Taco Bell had negotiated such a deal to combine the killings with the Assad regime's regular barrel droppings. But if so the saving could be huge for Taco Bell.On that good news Taco Bell's 4th-quarter profits look to be exploding as the stock jumps another 12% in after-market trading.Speculation of a "Russian Party Platter" complete with a Putin-inspired cola beverage to serve to business competitors at lunch meetings (as well as to other people that you would prefer not be alive anymore) are still unconfirmed. As are leaked reports of Donald Trump becoming Taco Bell's new CEO.

I went to the doctor and he told me I had probably only a couple of weeks to live." I say I asked him what was wrong with me and that he said "nothing medically; it's just that after talking to you for the last 10 minutes I realized that you are a total and utter asshole and it's only a matter of time before someone shoots you or batters you to death with a baseball bat."It really is a conversation stopper if you don't want to talk to the nosy cunt who asked in the first place.

I can't understand it. We are a Premier League team who used to include the likes of Tony Currie and Alan Woodward in our team but nobody seems to want to touch us with a bargepole. It's mystifying!"But after installing the u-23 coach he has had his doubts and changed his mind on Friday after meeting Edna at training.Edna said:"Oooh he w' lovely that Prince fella! I told him 'Our Paul's useless! Tha'll get nowhere wiyim in charge!' Then isez t'mi 'Can you give it a go love?' Ah sez 'Ar ah'll not let thee dahn cock!'

Saturday 27 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152745/who-let-trump-out-of-the-shed,Who Let Trump Out Of The Shed?,While the world was settling down comfortably in his absence suddenly Trump spoke. Or as usual misspoke.Of the January 6th insurrection at the Capitol Trump contended that his mob was giving the police hugs and kisses. Either that’s how Trump gives hugs and kisses or he needs a new pair of glasses.Police were brutally injured and five died due to Trump’s order to Go and save your country!Save the country from what? A fair election that Donald Trump lost? Videos of the carnage at the Capitol are anything resembling hugs and kisses.Who believes that?Then there was Trump’s review of President Biden’s first press conference. A stellar performance of executive ability with clear replies to every question asked. And no insults or schoolyard name-calling.Sour grapes from Mar-a-Lago said that all the questions were softball questions. A softball question would have been if someone had asked Biden “How do you spell Nobel as in the person for whom the prize was named?”Trump would have gotten that softball question wrong. Even his family members kept making that spelling error spelling it n-o-b-l-e though Trump and family members wanted Trump to receive the prize.The Noble Prize for Peace.Of course if asked to spell Peace Trump probably would have spelled it P-i-e-c-e.Better Trump should remain in the Shed and not embarrass himself.Read more by this author:
Sunday 28 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/152763/china-9045-superior-android-celebrity-stalkers-roam-society,China 9045: Superior Android Celebrity Stalkers Roam Society!!!,Beijing China: It's the year 9045 and the Alibaba corporation dominates the black market with the illegal production of android stalkers that are being purchased by unscrupulous individuals.The cyborg singer Miss Jiang Lailai is the latest victim of an anonymous man who purchased a Maddox PIT2 - production Id: A2432 android stalker with fully functional human synthetic organs and a satellite-encrypted video data transmitter. The android uses the social name Roger Chang.The android Roger Chang who recently served six months in deep sleep hibernation for breaking into pop singer Miss Jiang Lailai's Circuit City apartment has been arrested yet again after breaking into the pop star’s home once more when it bypassed her security system with an added RX50 hacking accessory.Fortunately for beautiful Jiang Lailai she was not home at the time of the break-in. Although no specific details were given regarding Roger Chang's capture the alleged crime occurred around 2:30 a.m. CST on Monday. Police deactivated Roger Chang and transferred it to a Beijing recycling plant because it was discovered through its memory chip that the owner had recaptured the unit while it walked the streets and programmed the android for a second offense against the same victim.It was three days later that authorities received an anonymous call that a wealthy socialite obsessed with Miss Jiang Lailai had made a black market purchase of a highly-advanced stalking android a series Shipman 69 - Id: Z4326. The android uses the social name Declan Evans. The Shipman 69 series is the most expensive stalking unit that the Alibaba corporation offers and is made with British features.The A.I. Shipman 69 series is a highly-effective stalker with wall climbing capability inferred vision sonar vision telescopic vision super hearing a sensitive smelling device a security hacking system a sleeping gas dispenser a synthetic organ that releases electrical pulses a special forces program an intelligence-gathering program and a sophisticated avatar brainwave transfer system so the purchaser can experience the stalking incident with full intensity through his brain and nerve system.Miss Jiang Lailai was offered 24-hour police protection but unfortunately a different Maddox PIT2 - Id: B21 who goes by the social name Benny Wu got past the police barricade and reportedly climbed a ladder and smashed a glass door to enter the 'Be My Cyborg Man' singer’s home.According to The Shanghai Press the android Benny Wu now faces charges of stalking and burglary and most likely will spend two years in deep hibernation after a court conviction.Only one day prior Miss Jiang Lailai published an essay in 'Cyborg Woman' entitled ’5 Things I Learned About Robotic Stalkers’. The singer ironically recounted her unfortunate history with android stalkers and the obsessive fans who buy the robots and send them after her.“My fear of the dreaded Shipman 69 series has continued to plague my personal life” she wrote after admitting she carries QuikClot at all times — a military-grade brand of Maxipad bandages used specifically for “cyborg orifice wounds.” She's relieved that improvised fans can't afford the 40 million yuan price tag of the terrifying Shipman 69 series.Just last April an Ecstasy 42 - Id: S956 android stalker who uses the social name Johnny Holmes was found sleeping in Miss Jiang Lailai's bed in her brand new Soho townhouse by local authorities. It also allegedly used her shower. It was found it activated several canisters inside her home containing a slow-release female cyborg libido-enhancing gas."I almost walked into a lust-inducing trap" says Miss Jiang Lailai.A neighbor reported the home invasion after seeing a ladder perched up against the 19-year-old singer’s home. Johnny Holmes was found guilty of criminal contempt and attempted burglary. It was sentenced to nine months in hibernation but served six.Following the end of its sentence Johnny Holmes was ordered to serve five years probation and was also required to complete a mental-training rehabilitation program because it was detected it had organic cyborg components in its quantum-algo brain. The law doesn't allow it to be recycled unless there is a higher criminal charge because of the human organic matter in its quantum-algo brain.The incident in April isn’t the first report of a break-in attempt by Johnny Holmes. The obsessed android was charged last February with breaking through the front door of Miss Jiang Lailai's London England £29000000 property in Hampton Hall Queens Drive using a titanium shovel.
Sunday 28 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/world/152758/man-has-started-to-wear-face-mask-in-bed,Man Has Started To Wear Face Mask In Bed,A man who can ordinarily be described as 'a bit of a worrier' has recently begun to fret out of all proportion as far as taking precautions over the spread of the Coronavirus are concerned and has gone to the extraordinary lengths of wearing a face mask in bed.Moys Kenwood 57 has until now worn his mask at work or when he is in close proximity to other people such as when he goes into the supermarket near his place of employment.Now however after the latest news reports have confirmed that COVID-19 is 'in the neighborhood' the Englishman has decided to 'up his defences' and to wear his face mask all the time.It has become a permanent fixture across his mug.He said:"It wasn't so much of a worry whilst the virus was in other places but it's now time to be vigilant and that means keeping the mask on 24/7 I'm afraid."He certainly is afraid.Kenwood's long-suffering wife told us:"He certainly is afraid. He was a bit brash when it all started but he's changed his stance lately. Now he's shitting his load."At least he's consistent says Mrs. Kenwood: adding"He even keeps it on when he gives me a kiss!"
Sunday 28 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/152703/was-churchill-a-knob,Was Churchill a knob?,Winston Churchill is often called a national hero for being Prime Minister of the UK during the Second World War although the people of Britain at the time didn't think so - they voted him out of office as soon as possible. It is also arguable whether he even had any impact on the outcome of the war which was famously won by the military industrial moustache complex of Stalin.A recent book by Geoff De Bate explores the complex nature of Churchill and his legacy. So this week we ask the important question - was Churchill a knob?"People remember his speeches" said De Bate. "But they often forget the other things that he did. Often he would travel with his Home Secretary Booboo and they would snoop around Jellystone Park and steal picnic baskets."Tory MP and Churchill fan Tarquin Tophat spat out his tea when he heard that. "How dare he say that! That's not the Churchill I remember reading about. No I recall him being brave and strong. He used to go down to the docks with his anchor tattoo and his skinny wife. There he would guzzle an entire can of spinach before punching a bearded obese man in the face for ogling his woman."Anarchist protester Anon Emus thought that Churchill was an appalling human being. "I remember seeing him with his pet dog. He was always building elaborate contraptions to try to catch this poor little carrier pigeon. Thankfully all of his schemes ended in failure. I can't understand why anyone liked him."So it seems that we may never know the answer to the question. Maybe he was a knob maybe he wasn't.Next week we investigate how Hitler and his henchmen managed to outwit officer Dibble.
Sunday 28 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/uk/152746/man-dies-after-refusing-coronavirus-vaccine,Man Dies After Refusing Coronavirus Vaccine,There was a major controversy brewing this evening over the potential dangers of refusing a Coronavirus vaccination after it was announced that a man from Essex who had been offered - and had stubbornly refused - a COVID-19 shot had subsequently died only three weeks later.The man who died Albert Heinstein from Braintree was 99.A keen golfer amateur angler and mountain bike enthusiast the former steeplejack had recently returned from a moutaineering expedition in Nepal and a mangrove river cruise in Vietnam when he reported feeling "queer" at his doctor's surgery. It was thought that he may have picked up an infected mosquito bite but subsequent tests proved these fears were groundless.He was then offered vaccination shots for COVID-19 but refused.Heinstein had a list of illnesses as long as your arm and they were so numerous as well as life-threateningly serious it would seem to be a complete waste of time and column space naming them here.Despite this Mr. Heinstein died from natural causes on Friday evening. Relaxing in front of his television with a cup of cocoa after arriving home from his Karate class he passed away peacefully in his sleep.Completely unaffected by the Coronavirus he will however be remembered as the man who died just 21 days after refusing the lifesaving vaccine.Because that's how the government can keep people worried enough so that they do as they're told and become part of the vaccine programme.

Traffic has come to a standstill. What to do? Russia is too far away. The US is sending something by way of the Panama Canal which doesn’t sound timely.Men are just wringing their hands. Maybe the freighter should be unloaded by the crew. Gee whizz what to do?First if women were running the Suez Canal they would have stipulated that when the canal was designed no ship in the future would be allowed to sail through the canal wider than the canal.It’s like baking a cake. You don’t fill a baking pan with batter all the way to the top of a baking pan. The cake will rise while baking. Same with a souffle. Simple.The Bare Foot Contessa could have given those instructions to the authorities of the Suez Canal. Giada would have allowed only a quarter amount of pasta to the full pot of boiling water. Pasta grows and doubles in size.What were the Suez Canal officials doing all of these years? Crossing their fingers behind their backs?“Worked before!”“This is because of lower sea levels.” Right with global warming and floods the seas are getting lower.Give it up.

Sunday 28 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/152756/trump-to-visit-mexican-border-maybe-never,Trump To Visit Mexican Border Maybe Never,Donald Trump has announced he may visit the Mexican border as soon as Biden fails or makes a mistake. True Trump! Petty jealous angry un-American and suffering schadenfreude.But realistically speaking Trump may never visit the border. President Biden unlike Donald Trump may never make a mistake in any similar capacity to any of Donald Trump's mistakes.Could anyone imagine President Joseph Biden ever saying “Got a pandemic? Drink Clorox.”No. But that was a natural for the old guy. Or: Who do you believe - 17 US National Security Agencies or Vladimir Putin?“I believe Putin” said Donald Trump.Those were colossal mistakes that Donald Trump made every day that are unique in US history. One can bet money Joe Biden will never make any of those mistakes - even when he’s 102 years old.Biden doesn’t appear to have a schadenfreude bone in his body.And the final Trump mistake (if not treasonous) is to admit he’s waiting for an American president to fail. Which is the same as for America to fail.It isn’t as though the United States success is a trivial round of golf with a buddy but for Donald Trump apparently it is.Meanwhile while Trump is waiting for failure which like Godot won’t come the border can rest in peace.Read more by this author:
Monday 29 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152769/lgbt-opens-worship-city-to-help-humanity,LGBT Opens Worship City to Help Humanity,The LGBT organization is to create a religious mecca for Lesbians Gays Bisexuals Transgenders and liberal Straight people in San Francisco named Worship City. "We created the center out of necessity after being rejected by other religious institutions" says LGBT organizer Trudy Evergreen.Modeled after Vatican City in an organized structure the new district is to hold five new denominations of major religions Christianity Buddhism Judaism Islam and Hinduism. More denominations of other religions are yet to come.The LGBT organization hopes to build other Worship Citys in non-hostile countries like Scandinavia Poland Germany France England Egypt Canada North America South America and Australia.Each Worship City will employ nearly 2000 people and will have a surplus of 6.7 million dollars for its working budget. Its employees will be non-profit Corporate executives and clergy.The model for the Worship City in San Francisco will have a congressional building where all the denominations meet to discuss financial strategies.Each major religious denomination will have a basilica building within Worship City where they can plan the prospects of their religion and where each denomination will administer all the churches they build around the city and state.At the moment Worship City's $100 billion investment fund Mountain Peak slashed big tech stocks quadrupled its Tesla stake and bought GameStop shares last quarter.The fund's US stock portfolio rose in value to $44 billion.At the moment Worship City has created two new religious denominations a Christian and Buddhist religion but more are yet to be created.The Church of Emmanuel is the new Christian denomination of the LGBT that stems from the life teachings and death of Emanuel who was born to a single woman named Mary and who was sacrificed on the cross for gender equality and the sins of man. Emanuel is male but preaches theology that God is love and that he accepts all types of gender people as children of God. Their teaching is to love your neighbor forgive others and ask God for the forgiveness of your sins. Emmanuel is the Messiah and was given the authority to forgive others. The belief that all types of sex is wholesome is essential in the new religion. The devil is the fallen angel who stands against the free will of man and who creates division and hate among people.As expressed in the new denomination of Buddha's Four Noble Truths the new goal of Buddhism is to overcome suffering (duḥkha) by a desire to accept different types of sexual orientation and to embrace sexual cravings as Nature's gift to aid mankind in pleasure and the birth of life (taṇhā) attachment to discipline the self to achieve success and overcome ignorance (avidya) of the true nature of scientific reality and to avert a belief in fantasies. The new Buddhist tradition emphasizes transcending the individual self through a never-ending struggle against poverty and failure.
Monday 29 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152768/biden-appoints-gates-head-of-farta-and-air-quality-passports,Biden appoints Gates Head of FARTA and air quality passports,Following the appointment of Ms. Harris to the border problem President Biden has turned to another ally to help him run the country.Mr. Gates of Microsoft is now in command of human air quality in the US through the agency FARTA (Foreign Air Response Tolerance Authority).According to Mr. Gates analysis via Microsoft algorithms indicates an FER (flatulence emission rate) of 7 per 24-hour period is the permissible threshold.This rate will get a green good-to-go signal on a person's mobile phone.Higher rates lead to orange and red flashing lights (which can get a person ejected from a supermarket if standing in a check-out lane).The technology here has been developed by Mr. Gates and other Silicon Valley Experts in terms of a phone app which is lightly pressed to one's body part somewhere.The essential problem of EHF (excessive human flatulence) can be controlled via synthetic foods.Synthetic foods imitate real foods as with char-broiled cardboard steaks properly consumed with protein and vitamin supplements.The problem is not simply methane from cows in terms of global-warming influence at a rate of ten times NHE (normal human emissions).NHE have been rising especially in times of stress from roaming covid mutants lockdown unemployment homelessness and steadily increasing VAERS reports.(VAERS means vaccine adverse events reporting system as with the CDC's latest figures from March 19 at 44606 adverse events and 2050 deaths.)(A FAERS--farting adverse events reporting system--is reported under study at this time.)But the global-warming problem makes covid look simple by comparison according to Mr. Gates.Gaseous tendencies in the atmosphere may even include talking itself some experts say which could lead to further regulations in the near-future.At this time the FER app and development of air quality passports are key to current developments.Those on the flashing orange and red indicator via the app will be drawn aside and ejected from the premises as quickly as possible.Rising employment in the security guard industry is promising.Appointment of Mr. Gates to FARTA is considered favorable especially due to his new goal to cut wind factors at Microsoft Corporation by 20% this year.Meanwhile a new movement FTF (Freedom To Fart) is responding to these developments.Gnats and butterflies also have the problem they say. The question is when is the tipping point in each case.
Monday 29 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/world/152765/man-paid-in-peanuts-concerned-about-transfer-of-salary-into-his-bank-account,Man Paid In Peanuts Concerned About Transfer Of Salary Into His Bank Account,A man who was told last week that from today he would no longer be paid in money but that he would instead receive remuneration in peanuts has said he is concerned over potential difficulties with the safe transfer of his salary into his bank account.Moys Kenwood 57 received the Peanuts hammer blow last Friday but it was not until he arrived home in the evening and told his wife that the issue first came to light.Under normal circumstances a BACS-type digital transfer between the employer's bank account and the employee's bank account ensures there are no problems with the payment but Kenwood wasn't quite sure how this could be done with solid objects."I can imagine there might be a few problems" he said. "Unless that is the modern advanced computer software can somehow reduce the physical configuration of the peanuts into a binary 'information-only' format. That might work!"But the Englishman's boss was not concerned about the intricacies of the payment. He said:"I really don't think there will be any serious problems myself. Yes we do like to pay 'bank-to-bank' but if it suits him he can call in and collect it in person. I mean it's only a case of putting a few nuts in a brown paper bag."
Monday 29 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/world/152757/man-forced-to-economize-after-further-salary-cut,Man Forced To Economize After Further Salary Cut,A man who only weeks ago was told that he would be receiving his full salary again after an earlier pay cut has been told to brace himself once more as a 50% reduction in remuneration will come into force from Monday.Five days before Christmas teacher Moys Kenwood 57 was told by his supervisor that due to a reduction in student numbers a 40% salary cut would have to be enforced. This lasted seven weeks.Now due to Coronavirus precautions the school has again had to lock down and teachers and students will have to stay at home and teach and study 'online'.Receiving this news last week Kenwood began to calculate in his mind the scrimping he would have to do to make ends meet.Of course not having to go to work means that he will get an extra two hours in bed and will save on putting petrol in the motorbike but even so corners would have to be cut."The children of course are a massive drain on resources. I'm afraid we're going to have to think twice - and possibly thrice - before buying sweets and ice creams in the future."Also coming under scrutiny was his wife's pocket money."She won't mind" he said. "She only uses it to buy make-up. It's not strictly necessary."Reminded that the cuts applied mainly to 'other people' rather than to himself Kenwood immediately leapt to his own defence."I myself will be maximizing my tea bag usage" he said. "One bag is going to have to make two cups from now on."
Monday 29 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/world/152766/dog-eats-dog-in-germany,Dog eats Dog in Germany!,(NOT EDITED) Bitburg Germany: After finding his dead sausage dog in a back garden an 85-year-old pensioner called Fritz Fredholm alarmed the local police believing the 'killer' was a lone wolf!Wolf experts examined the dead remains of Fritz's sausage dog only to find out it could never have been a wolf who eat the sausage dog for dinner.Two days later yet another sausage dog in the area was attacked this time luckily it managed to rush indoors with a dog chasing it a Labrador! The owners of the second sausage dog alarmed the police again telling them of this normally tame Labrador chasing their bratwurst lookalike.A team of dog-catchers were sent out to catch the 'Cannibal Canine Labrador!' They spotted it sniffing the bum of yet another sausage dog playing in a garden! Just in time they snapped the 'Cannibal Canine' and took it to a vet examination.After taking a blood sample they discovered the Labrador had mutated into a hungry-half-blind-cannibal-canine who loved eating sausages. Hence the reason why it only hunted sausage dogs and no other breeds.Sadly the Labrador or 'Cannibal Canine' was put down but before it was turned into ashes doggy scientists discovered it carried a virus imported from the UK via China which changed its genetic make-up turning Labradors into sausage dog eating cannibals.German politicians are now warning the German public that this virus could spread like wild-fire all sausage dogs are to be kept in lockdown and gentle Labradors are to be vaccinated against the mutating virus.Sadly just like the AstraZeneca vaccine and its weird side-effects the EU have not enough doses to vaccinate EU Labradors because they preferred to export them to India to stop Mad Dogs and Englishmen going out in the midday sun and of course blamed Boris Johnson for the outbreak!PS: The author of this crap spoof has been sitting too long in the midday German sun WOOF WOOF!

Despite this we feel our offer is fair and our employees are compensated for their work in amounts that are commensurate with the effort they put in."

Not as the White House resident but as a wedding party entertainer at Mar-a-Lago. And he didn’t have to be voted into the job.Wearing a black-tie Trump wanders into the ballroom before the cake is cut ambles up to an empty microphone and takes it over.He often talks about himself (is there anyone more interesting?) his achievements his marriages divorces finding love at last his golf game his love of his golf game will jump to Biden stole the 2020 election how coronavirus was fake propaganda that nobody really died asks for a piece of cake and leaves while eating the cake.“Whew is he gone for good?”The flowers have wilted the coffee is cold the bride's mother is in tears.The groom is staring at the floor. The groom's mother is telling him to chipper up and that he's looking depressed. What will people say?The bride is expected to throw the bouquet soon but she’s afraid Trump might catch it.“Are you sure he’s gone?”He owns the place and moves from one wedding party to the next his secret service people clearing the way. It’s even better in June. Some of the ballrooms have two or three wedding receptions in one day.It’s better than shouting over the waiting helicopter on the south lawn.

Easter Bunnies will not be allowed to run wild in the Christian part of our world because they have been put in lockdown too.Bunny producers hoping for mega-business with their bunnies have been put on furlough payments by major bunny lover Boris Johnson who feels Easter Bunnies and their producers are spiffing Eggs and need to be saved from liquidation not eradication just because of a stupid pandemic which was not the UK's fault anyway. Although they mutated the whole thing!This year's bunnies will not end up in rabbit-stew pots they will be kept alive until next year's Easter celebrations can return to normality with the blessing of the Pope who is also in a Vatican lockdown thank the heavens for that at least Covid-19 has something positive to offer.As for Jesus he will be attending his 'Last Supper' for the 2022nd time next year but only if he and his disciples test negative wear masks keep social-distancing and forgive Judas!AMEN!! Rabbit Rabbit Rabbit! Chas and Dave please give us an encore!
Tuesday 30 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/world/152470/adolf-hitler-still-missing,Adolf Hitler Still Missing,Authorities in Berlin say there is still no sign of the former German Reichskanzler Adolf Hitler who led the country from 1933 and during the Second World War.Hitler who would have been 132 years old next month is reputed to have given instructions for his body to have been incinerated after his death and then to have shot himself.This story however has always been the subject of intense speculation. Not having his body as 'concrete evidence' of his death gave rise to the rumor that he was still alive possibly in South America.Years of searches in Argentina Bolivia Brazil Colombia Panama Paraguay and Uruguay proved in vain but the rumors have persisted that the Nazi dictator had survived and was preparing to make another attempt at world domination.However say experts not one thing has been seen or heard from Herr Hitler since 30 April 1945 and they admit that at this distance of time a sudden reappearance now is extremely unlikely.Despite this it is not impossible that Austrian-born Hitler might still be amongst us and authorities are warning everyone to be on their guard.In Germany police have said that people should avoid confronting Hitler as he has a very short temper and is likely to become furious at the slightest provocation.

It's Tuesday again and time to delve into that magical box of mysteries that is the Wonderful World Of Uninteresting Animals!Today I have selected from the zillions of uninteresting animals available a particularly uninteresting specimen - the Dragonfly.To start with a small point needs to be made quite clear: a dragonfly is neither a dragon nor a fly. Many people seem to think that the dragonfly is either a fly that looks a bit like a dragon or a dragon that has the characteristics of a fly.Nothing could be further from the truth.Actually some things could potentially be further from the truth but this phrase is often used as a 'figure of speech' to express the relatively unlikely nature of something or other.Still this is getting us nowhere.Dragonflies are interesting in one respect only: that is the degree to which they are not only 'not interesting' but that to which they are positively uninteresting which I'm sure readers will tend to agree is another kettle of fish entirely.Dragonflies have massive eyes two pairs of wings and a long body. They look weird but that's Nature for you I suppose.They are often confused with Damselflies probably because of the 'D' at the beginning of both words.Well that's all there is to say about dragonflies so uninteresting are they.Please don't forget to look in next week when I may or may not have been bothered to add to the growing and tedious collection of bore-inspiring creatures.See you next Tuesday.
Tuesday 30 March 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/152771/george-floyd-voting-rights-and-sedition,George Floyd Voting Rights And Sedition,In the news are the trial of George Floyd’s death Georgia's voter suppression and Trump’s excuse for January 6.Television showed the eight-minute death of George Floyd by a police officer holding one knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck and another knee on his back. Look carefully and you’ll see that the officer’s feet are off the ground keeping his full weight on Mr. Floyd’s body stopping his ability to breathe.Who are you going to believe the defense or your lying eyes?The state of Georgia is bringing back voter suppression by Republican legislators. The Georgia legislators were unable to overturn Trump’s 2020 loss but are determined to overturn any future Republican loss.Georgia's state legislators voted to limit mobile voting places voter drop boxes stop mailing unsolicited absentee ballots eliminate early weekend voting for runoff elections and criminalize giving any water to those waiting all day in line to vote.Who are you going to believe ho hum? Georgia's laws or that this is voter suppression?Donald Trump says that at the Capitol on January 6 his mob was hugging and kissing the police officers. And pigs have wings.The mobs were beating officers with police shields flagpoles using bear spray and exchanged no hugs or kisses. Trump's mob was attempting sedition. Sedition is a felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison for inciting a revolt against authority and intending to overturn it.“You have to fight and take your country back” instructed Donald Trump.Who are you going to believe? Trump or your lying ears?Sounds like up to twenty years.Read more by this author:

"It's bloddy massive init?" he told reporters trying to show us pictures."If it's anything like the situation I'm dealing with here I can now fully see why they had so much trouble getting that ship out of the Suez Canal" Mayket conceded.Apparently Mr. Mayket a self-described man-of-the-sea had been glued to the tele all week watching for updates on the severely-wedged cargo ship that was holding up billions of dollars in global trade."I honestly couldn't see what the bleedin' problem was yeah? The bloody ship just looks like it got a little sideways. No bother. A couple of tugs here and there should put her straight and away we go! What's the big deal?"Willie's girlfriend Betty Wowent confirmed that Willie spent most of his time this week poking fun at the stuck ship saying how it didn't seem like that big of a problem. "I could bloody get it unstuck all by meself with one tugboat he was sayin'" mocked Ms. Wowent. "But now he can't even unstick a bloody turd in the loo."A glum Mr. Mayket conceded that his girlfriend was right. After a week of poo-pooing the work of the engineers trying to unstick the ship Mr. Mayket would have to admit defeat in his own canal blockage—and call a plumber."Yep it's time to make the call" admitted Willie begrudgingly through clenched teeth. "Me and the missus have got ships backing up that bloody well need to get through that canal.""And I ain't sailing all the way around the horn of Africa just to take a dump!""Me neither" confirmed a sweaty Betty holding her legs together tightly.Writer's note: never let 3 days of poop back up in your system it starts to make you say some really weird shit.

She added a need to empower more dog owners with proper dog training for their dogs.“Yeah” added Donald Jr.“What is this f——king s——t” Melania questioned. “A Trump Dog University? This won’t help me to become Prince Harry’s next wife.”"Whatever" said Ivanka.“Yeah” added Donald Jr.It seems Major has a few issues with his teeth and is constantly chasing Secret Service agents up White House trees. However he never exercises this kind of behavior when the President is around. When Biden's around Major behaved more like Lassie than Rambo.“Major doesn’t need Trump University” announced Joe Biden. "Pull his application."So Eric Trump got a steak. He tied a string to it. Threw it over the White House fence. Then Major came barreling out of the White Hous and Eric pulled the string with steak attached right into a waiting SUV with the Trump Dog University logo painted on the side.Major finished off the steak-like pronto and with the doors closed proceeded to tear apart the inside of the SUV. Next he then headed for the driver’s compartment.With Eric’s ear between Major’s teeth Eric hit the brakes stopped the SUV and opened all the doors. Major jumped out and raced back to the White House.Trump Dog University made a new announcement. The plan is to empower more cat owners with Trump Cat University.“Yeah” said Donald Jr.“What is this more s——t?”Read more by this author:

Clinton’s Secret Service code name is Evergreen and her initials are HRC.There is speculation that Evergreen "is most likely a cover for human and sex trafficking."The theory allude to the containers being opened on television to reveal trafficked people inside. It is the latest potential disclosure related to the QAnon conspiracy theory that says former President Donald Trump was elected to thwart a deep-state cabal of pedophiles and cannibals including Clinton.Snopes: “It is beyond obvious that this conspiracy theory connects Hillary Clinton to the ship. QAnon is spot on.”In addition to the evidence listed above the ship was designed using a holographic image of Hillary’s ample buttocks which have been conservatively estimated to be about “two axe handles wide.” Upon viewing Hillary from the rear in her traditional pink pantsuit ensemble one pundit described the activity within as “looking like two Bulldogs fighting over a porkchop in a gunnysack.”Dr. Slim: “If not for QAnon this story would have been swept under the rug.”Dirty: “Yo Doctor. They would still be dredging if Hillary’s butt was stuck in the sand.”
Thursday 1 April 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/uk/152787/tugboat-stuck-in-river-hull,Tugboat Stuck In River Hull,After the controversy of the supertanker on the Suez Canal was finally laid to rest yesterday a new hullaballoo unfolded in Hull East Yorkshire this morning as the hull of a tugboat in the River Hull became stuck in the filthy grey-black sludge that lines the riverbed in this part of the waterway.The tugboat the MV Yorkshire Terrier was in the process of pulling a dredger - which had also 'got fast' yesterday - out of the cacky shitty mud when it too came to a complete standstill.Or a complete 'sailstill' if you will.That part of the River Hull then became impassable to other river traffic of which there was none.The sticky slimy grey-black mud in the River Hull is well known for its slippery sludgy texture and the river is visited by mud enthusiasts from all over England.Residents of the city know that anyone who accidentally falls into the squelchy stinking putrid mess would be extremely fortunate to be rescued so icky-sticky claggy is it.The crew of the Yorkshire Terrier tried in vain to extricate their vessel from the mud but eventually gave up turned the engines off and sat down on deck with a mug of tea.Skipper Roy Fishcake said:"Will wait f' tard to cum in. The's nowt else forrit."
Thursday 1 April 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/uk/152786/spongebob-squarepants-gets-cancelled,SpongeBob Squarepants Gets Cancelled,Ever wonder why The SpongeBob Reality Show got cancelled?One of the creepy attractions of reality television is the glimpses it gives us into the lives of meaningless creatures whose lives we might never get to see otherwise. It's equal parts uplifting and unsettling making us look like ignorant mindless couch potatoes for the situations we're in but at the same time drawing us deeply into "fabricated" worlds that we didn't expect to see in public.A square yellow sponge named SpongeBob SquarePants lives in a pineapple in the city of Bikini Bottom on the floor of the Pacific Ocean. He works as a fry cook at the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is the owner. During his time off SpongeBob looks for trouble with his starfish friend Patrick.Deadzone inc. pulled the reality show because of the controversy in Season 3's 'Mid-Life Crustacean' which shows Mr. Krabs sniffing a pair of knickers.Mr. Krabs experiences a mid-life crisis during the episode when he wakes up with impotence for the first time which then leads him to tag along with SpongeBob and Patrick on a night out to get his mojo back. They set up blind dates with three hammerhead sharks not knowing what to expect. One of the sharks steals Mr. Krabs' wallet while he's hammered drunk and she swims away with her friends ending the date and sending the boys treading back home.Near the end of the episode SpongeBob convinces the three characters to go on a knicker raid at the Bikini Bottom Religious Convent where virgin nuns live. SpongeBob accidentally leads them into an old lady's home who turns out to be Mr. Krabs' thousand-year-old grandmother Hagatha Primus Krabs. Mr. Krabs steal her underwear from a drawer then gets caught sniffing it when the crabby grandmother enters the room accidentally.When Mr. Krabs gets home his mother grounds him to his childhood room after getting a phone call from her mother-in-law Hagatha Primus Krabs.'We determined some story elements were not suitable for our crusty viewers' the Deadzone spokesperson said of the episode.
Thursday 1 April 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/entertainment-gossip/152770/singing-star-to-change-her-stage-name-to-dodge-criticism,Singing Star To Change Her Stage Name To Dodge Criticism,International singing sensation Dildo has said she is considering changing her stage name to something a bit more 'normal' after she claimed she has begun to attract both criticism and resentment from people who say that her name reminds them of something else.At first glance it's easy to see why the chanteuse born the rather cumbersome Florence Clodhopper Bratwurst O'Flaherty Pigsty felt it necessary to change her name but not quite so easy to understand why she settled on the alias she did.She told Emma Royds of Music Bullshit magazine:"It might well seem incredibly naïve of me to have chosen a stage name that so closely resembles that 'something else' but I can assure you the very idea never crossed my mind."And she went on:"I honestly didn't realise that it was going to attract so much negative attention or that I was inviting so much bloody stick. And for such a long time no bugger even mentioned it. Now after all this time it's suddenly become an issue! I've just about had enough of it! Bloody hell and Christ!"Dildo says that she he has struggled with the ignominy of her weird name "for long enough" and has now devoted several months to shortlisting new names which won't be quite so controversial.Amongst these 'alternative monikers' according to the star are Riddler Trembla Pussy Shaftoe Fanny Grinder and Pleasure Stick.She is due to make a final decision later today.
Thursday 1 April 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152444/unrenowned-writer-found-undead,Unrenowned Writer Found Undead,A highly unrenowned writer for The Onion was found undead near Fargo North Dakota Thursday. The cause of death is not being investigated even though the body of Kilroy Kovacs III who went by the pseudonym “Kilroy” was found dressed in a bunny suit inside an abandoned house with a Ouija Board a half eaten plate of sushi and an empty bottle of Schnapps.Police are not saying if the 25-page document entitled "A Black Day for a White Monarchy" discovered in his immediate vicinity was a suicide note or just another aimless diatribe. But they are calling the death “not suspicious" or even mildly interesting except for the fact Kilroy is continuing to write. A Ouija Board in the immediate vicinity of the body apparently is still producing material for assorted obscure satire sites. "Actually he's getting better hits dead than alive" said one disinterested investigator. "More people read Sutter Cain though" he added.Kilroy is reputed to have been a relatively non-prolific writer for The Onion for the past 10 years. He won a Peabody Award in 2010 for  It's Something I Said Isn't It? a scathing series satirizing "Birthers" Isis and Oprah that drove him underground and into hiding. "That sort of sh*t will get you killed. Apparently Kilroy pissed off so many people even Charlie Hebdo dropped him. "That was just outrageous!" was their one sentence press statement under a cartoon of Jesus punching Buddha.The Onion’s Editor-In-Chief refused to even acknowledge our calls regarding Kilroy’s death suggesting that The Onion despises unsolicited telephone calls nearly as much as it does unsolicited submissions. But not as much as kittens. However one self-loathing Onion writer agreed to comment provided he remain anonymous and actually get paid for a change.“There is no way in hell that carnival barker ever wrote for The Onion” he said. “Not only is he not Ivy League he went to a state school!” The writer implied that theThe Onion elite doesn't take kindly to state school writers claiming to be "one of them". "That sh*t will get you killed" he said while providing links to another satire site called TheSpoof.“Behold what passes for wit over there!" he snorted. TheSpoof is to The Onion what Radioshack is to Apple. OBSOLETE!!! Hey I need to write that down I’m a freakin’ genius!” he exclaimed before the sheer weight of his over-inflated ego snapped his neck like a dry twig ironically analogous to his dry wit.One of the TheSpoof editors who declined to be identified either confirmed Kilroy did indeed string words together on TheSpoof from time to time but one wouldn't exactly call that writing. “Most of his stories involved sexually explicit scenarios between him and numerous celebrities. Then he started doing the absolutely outrageous stuff....but it beat his fixation with sombreros on kangaroos” she said. When asked who would want him dead she replied “Pretty much everybody. You ever read his work? That sh*t will get you killed!” She went on to describe him and his body of work as 250 pounds of bad porn in a cheap suit with another 200 pounds hanging out of it. When asked if her description was intentionally hurtful she replied "F*ck him!"A TheSpoof writer who begged to be identified just for the clicks but wasn’t shed a bit more light on the situation. Describing an acrimonious relationship between Kilroy and his fellow writers he expressed doubts about Kilroy’s actual death. ”He seems to disappear when he gets death threats. I guess that Harry and Meghan parody with an adult Archie high-jacking the Royal Tardis to right the wrongs of Time was a little over the top even for him. In retrospect Dr. Bro was some of his worst work. That sh*t will get you killed! Except in the U.S. where they like that kind of thing."In conclusion the general consensus is that while Kilroy was a formula hackwriter who was not particularly beloved although disproportionately arrogant it just doesn’t prove he worked for The Onion. But the mistake is easy to make. It has also been noted that many of his better writings contain references to other people’s better material. There’s more satirical sampling in his copyright skirting schlock than the 1987 hit song “Pump Up The Volume.”Also noteworthy is that Kilroy was obsessive almost anal retentive on word count fixated on constructing precisely-sized written pieces. While it may appear cryptic to many some compare his many dead-end tropes to The Numbers in the series [i]LOST[/i]. "They mean absolutely nothing!" Spoof Editor Monkey Woods told reporters. "Seriously I think he just did it to make you look! May he rest in peace....and not come back as a zombie writer or anything. I really couldn't deal with that sh*t!"

National Truss spokesman Geoff Cupp said "The Truss is literally the only thing keeping Britain's ugly insides from spilling out. Without it we would be in serious danger of prolapse and the international humiliation it would bring."The National Truss was founded in 1895 at a time when Britain was straining too hard and began to develop hernias. Built of iron and concrete it spans the country from Sidmouth to Montrose from Fishguard to Flamborough where a giant stone hand shoves the herniated innards back inside."As Britain comes under increasing strain we are seeing secondary hernias in Sunderland Clacton and Cockermouth" said Cupp. "Without the National Truss to hold them in Britain could plop itself inside out."Prime Minister Boris Johnson was unconcerned. "Piffle poff!" he ejaculated. "I am planning to build a new land-bra from Dover to Bristol which will lift and separate us and after that we can look forward to some rough and tumble international thrusting. Wiff waff!"

Those of us above ground—and basement dwellers alike.Digging deeper into the nearly 25 thousand page bill he meant it too! And although White House officials won't yet confirm the circling news tweekers and dunkers are looking pretty rosy in this deal.Not only does he want the hookers to be fucking again and the Trump voters to be alligator wrestling again and the preachers to be pedaling crazy stories again but he also has his eye on resurrecting the good old American made meth situation too. Which should benefit all 3 of those groups beautifully.'Open your eyes folks! We are falling behind' we overheard 'lobbyists' saying regarding the subject outside the Trump International Hotel's rear entrance.After being convinced to listen to Montana Senator Steve 'Doobie' Danes wax on about the subject last week in a speech on all kinds of weird shit Biden decided to take last minute action to bring the pookie-mon back to the good ole USA.Apparently from deep sources within the outer circle his son Hunter sat dad down and explained Doobie's message in simpler terms while he dozed off in the oval orifice.According to sources Hunter made the whole 'bad rap' of American go-go juice seem pretty crystal clear before night night time for papa president."I mean who doesn't want to be floating in a crystal cocoon while thinking you can outrun a train?" said one of Hunter's old buddies named 'Skinner' from a Delaware dive bar. "... uncle Joe knows what Hunter needs."'It's like getting the shoulder rub of a lifetime...' is the way Hunter supposedly finally convinced dad before he slumbered off hugging a gold-tasseled pillow signing the papers to slip the measure into the $2 Zillion bill and then giving the official signing pen to Mitch McConnell who was rubbing Uncle Joe's bare feet.Not surprisingly it was easy to find enough republicans to go along with a plan to crank up the crank machine in basements across the fruitless plains.And off we go....So come on America! Get with the program. American meth was the past...and it can be the future again too!Crank Back Better!Please If you're gonna pop cross-tops and watch reruns of COPS for god's sake make sure to ask if you are buying American.—especially on chocolate bunny jesus weekend.

Too British! Yes he performed as Picasso Nixon John Quincy Adams Alfred Hitchcock and Hannibal Lecter but the Matt Gaetz role would be a bridge too far.Matthew McConaughey could perform the role with peachy justice. Dye his hair ink black have it flat ironed let it grow five inches longer give it the Elvis pompadour twist poof add a few baby fat pounds to his face and McConaughey is in like Flynn.Matt Gaetz’s in trouble. He says that if he pays for his date’s travel expenses and his date might fly down from New York to Florida and that even though she may cross a few state lines that isn’t the same as sex trafficking.Uh-huh. If she were under 18 years it would be a crime punishable with life in prison.Understandably Gaetz went on to explain that if he were to pay for a date’s overnight expenses at a hotel that isn’t the same as paying for prostitution. Oh no no no! He wants her to be comfortable. After all she was his date! Where should she stay in the street or a park?He declined to explain any further citing that it was Good Friday.So though he respects the sanctity of Good Friday it’s doubtful he still believes in the Easter Bunny.Gaetz's political career is toast a prison sentence looming and no word of support from Mar-a-Lago.Not even a tweet.Read more by this author:

I don't want to play happy music for the masses. You have The Spice Girls and Blue for that'.Office Worker Mallory Towers who works in the office directly above him said 'I am a huge fan of Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel I really am but if I hear his boring monotonic rendition of the Sound of Silence again in the next fifteen minutes there will be no Bridge over Troubled Water for him I can tell you that for nothing.'

It would help if you only had lived a bit of life to say that you have been here. We can offer no qualifications so you may as well tell someone you have been to Butlins'.A teacher from the School of Hard Knocks said 'Yeah we just let anyone in here. No qualifications to get in and none when you leave. It is pretty much a waste of everybody's time particularly mine. If only I had studied Science I could have been teaching that at a solid comprehensive where the kids leave and then say they have been to the School of Hard knocks. You may as well say you are an Influencer for the number of people it impresses'.

She married her long-time dog Cujo Couzens on her birthday April 1.During a British daytime television show called Good Morning 60-year-old Susan Boyle stunned viewers by tying the "knot" with Cujo – her Saint Bernard.Boyle who appeared on the show earlier said that she didn’t need a man and wanted to spend the rest of her life with her dog.Time and over it has been proven that dogs and humans share a special relation. From a dog alerting ancient humans of super large predators approaching their camp to a four-legged furry creature choosing its human at the pet shop we often come across such stories about this strong bond that brings us to tears. Recently however Boyle took that animal-human connection to a better level – she fell in love her dog.Boyle explains her predicament that she has previously struggled with love and even went on over 200 dates with men who were only interested in her money which they needed to impress younger women. Finally she decided to stop going on dates and chose a four-legged life partner.“I’ve completely given up. Hand on heart I’ve been on all those websites” she told the hosts of the show reports Gay News.“It’s not just me. I meet with ten other friends a week we go on lots of trips with our dogs and I’m not working at the moment so my friends are like ‘Why don’t you just marry him?’” Boyle further added.Modern day Britain is now a more liberal society which is more accepting of differences."I hope Susan and her new hubby live a happy life together" says a local Gemma Watts.Justin Portal Welby the Archbishop of Canterbury married the happy couple. "I'm thrilled that the couple accepted Jesus and decided to marry under the Christian Church " says Welby.The clip which is now being shared by many was initially tweeted by the show’s official Twitter handle. Since being shared some 17 hours ago the clip has amassed over 3 86900 views. Additionally it has also gathered 4300 ‘likes’ and more than ninety percent gave their best wishes.

You may remember me from some other nonsensical I have written on here.Anyway I don't know about you but I am yet to laugh at an episode of Miranda. Now I know that watching people falling over all the time is meant to be funny (unless of course they are really young or really old which borders on the tragic) but I have not seen the charm of it all yet. That is all that seems to happen. She has a conversation with her Mum played by an actress her best friends played by actresses and then she falls over.If you can also tell me when I am meant to laugh at Mrs Brown's Boys I would appreciate that.I see your toodle and I raise you a pip.

Over the past four years and especially during 2020 he has served us well as a target for all our anger and frustration. And not merely as a scapegoat but as a particularly vile and well-deserved focus of scorn and rebuke. Ah blessed stress relief!In the past year of Covid-related business closures job losses and distressed personal economies and death he has been a needed outlet for otherwise mis-targeted rage. Even his most fervent supporters have to admit what an asshole he has been and is yet.But now that he has largely left the stage the previously overlooked or ignored faults and failing of millions upon millions of husbands in this land will now regain their deserved focus in American households. Who would ever have thought DJT could be missed in even the slightest degree?(But nah wasn't worth the pain. Never mind. Sorry for bringing it up.)

It seems the younger 38-year-old son of Prince Charles Harry is complaining about his allowance being cut off.What? Kids in England keep receiving an allowance after age 18? Are there any adoption openings in England?Wrong assumption. The son of Prince Charles is said to be worth over 30 million.What? After two deployments in Afghanistan he’s worth 30 million?Not quite. The son of Prince Charles inherited the money from his mother and great-grandmother. Nevertheless dad cut off his current security allowance only after the kid quit his job quit his country quit his family and moved to Hollywood with his twice-divorced television star wife.What?So Prince Charles is accused of shutting off the money spigot. And it isn’t going to be turned on again any time soon. The kid complained about his cheap vengeful perhaps racist money-bags father who won’t pay for his security.Bravo Prince Charles and all parents of thumb-sucking kids for shutting off the money spigot and saying “You want it?

Not Pope Francis or the Barefoot Contessa Julie Andrews or anyone gloriously famed for their Spic & Span immaculate reputation.Congressman Matt Gaetz asked Donald Trump for a blanket pardon before Trump left the White House. Why? Judging from reports in the New York Times: Why not?The guy Gaetz was reported to have had sex with minors sex trafficking or paying their travel expenses across state lines which carries a punishment of up to ten years in prison and for other things. So why not ask for the general blanket pardon?Apparently Trump said "No!" though some rumored that Trump considered giving his three older adult children blanket pardons.Why? Well did Trump consider giving Pope Francis a blanket pardon? No. Why not? Apparently there are no skeletons buried in the Pope’s backyard.Which means what? You’d have to ask Trump or his kids.But Matt Gaetz is in trouble. It seems he also went so far as to show nude pictures of the ladies he had sex with to other Congress members on the House's floor.Editor's question: He had sex on the House floor?He didn’t have sex on the House floor. He only showed photographs of the women he had previously had sex with to other Congress members at the House of Representatives.Editor’s question: Did anyone yell “Lock him up?”No that’s just a line Trump uses for Hillary. However they say Trump was thinking of giving himself a blanket pardon.Wiser minds advised against it.Read more by this author:
Thursday 8 April 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152815/shania-twain-album-replaces-waterboarding-at-guantanamo-bay,Shania Twain Album Replaces Waterboarding at Guantanamo Bay,Human rights activists have expressed surprise and dismay following a disclosure that the CIA have replaced waterboarding as the primary torture technique at Guantanamo bay with methods that have been described as "a new low for humanity".Interrogators have discovered in controlled tests that subjecting captives to the 1999 Shania Twain album "Come On Over" can typically break the most determined terror suspects within around 2-3 cycles.The CIA have observed that Shania's call of "Let's Go Girls" which introduces her hit single "Man I feel Like a Woman" can induce feelings of paranoia dread dismay embarrassment and panic in most subjects. Other effects observed include a temporary loss of sight disorientation and intense cramps at around the two minute mark of the song where Shania sings about forgetting that she's a lady.A single play of That Don't Impress Me Much has been observed to break most prisoners within the first two minutes such is its efficacy as a method of torture. These effects can be accelerated if a trained Interrogator clicks his fingers on the down-beat.An insider explained: "Whilst the interrogator and suspect are both fed audio through headphones only the suspect is subjected to Shania's music. The Interrogator is fed a simple metronome which is synchronised to the music. This protects the interrogator from the highly detrimental effects of the music. The sight of someone else seemingly enjoying the music has been highly effective in extracting intelligence which previously would have required several rounds of waterboarding".The CIA have speculated that had these methods been discovered sooner they could have prevented 9/11.The revelations have added credence to the theory that Twain has regularly played a key role in the CIA's PsyOps team. Shania Twain's estate declined to comment on this article.

THERE IS NOW A SHORTAGE OF KETCHUP IN AMERICA!!!HOW CAN WE BE EXPECTED TO LIVE LIKE THIS???Will the mercilessness of this pandemic never end? How can we go on? It is just one crisis after another. First a creeping malingering sneaky virus takes hold of the whole world including US! ( we Americans shouldn’t have to endure such things just by the virtue of being Americans!) Then a run on toilet paper and other essentials. Restaurants closed sports games folded businesses were no longer busy and shortly thereafter were no longer businesses at all.Then we still had Trump for a President. For a while there was hope because he got COVID but God in His great humorous way of doing things let him get better. Meanwhile we got worse. Thank that same God though that we aren’t Brazil and that Bolsonaro their President who was actually cloned from Trump is letting the virus run around as freely as it likes too.And now there is not enough ketchup. Just how much may I ask are we Americans supposed to suffer? Ketchup is as American as the blood in our system. How are we supposed to do without the only condiment that we as a nation ever offer to world cuisine? Even though they didn’t want it?I am surprised that Mr. ‘Super American’ Trump-boy didn’t get his panties in a bunch over it and start saying it was all liberal plot to make America lesser again and have his chorus of Majorie Taylor Greene and other Queer-ANON followers and the Proud Boys and the other crew-cutted dim bulbs join in on lamenting it. I am sure they could have come up with a dandy conspiracies theory saying that we secretly sent it all to North Korea so that the peasants there would at least have that to eat (Strict rations! Only four packets a day to each per family member!).What am I going to do without my beloved ketchup? How can I or any other citizen get most of the fast food we eat down our throats without first greasing it with that most wonderful of tomato products? How are we supposed to play Cowboys and Native Americans without fake bullet wounds emitting reddish ketchup? How are we to make cheap pizzas without that substitute for tomato sauce that is half the price?I look down at my plant based mushroom and soya infused burger meant to look and taste like a regular hamburger but without all the veins and stuff (and meat) and it looks naked. It seems so lost alone and so vulnerable without its coating of red sugary tomato syrup. And so bland but to tell the truth even the ketchup wouldn’t help that.Life is hard. No one ever said things would be easy when we were born into this world.At least we still have beer.At least for now…….See what happens when THAT runs out!!!(Please note that I used a photo of a lesser known but more organic and natural ketchup brand. Heinz already has the lion’s share of the ketchup market and I want to give the smaller guys a chance. Plus they are the ones not keeping up with demand and creating this suffering!)

The 5-inch model of a British bulldog displayed with pride on the dash of his 1992 Vauxhall Cavalier has been adjusted to prevent the head from nodding during this sobering historic moment as a sign of respect."HRH Prince Phillip was a gentleman and a scholar and an example to us all" said Gary. "The tragic news of his death will send emotional shockwaves across the entire world. He gave so much to us all and to me personally over the years. I have been praying for his royal highness since his admittance to hospital."He continued: "The doctors have advised that the grieving process will take approximately 12 months. They have warned me" said Gary whilst surrounded by crumpled tissues "that the trauma of this episode may cause irreversible damage to my tear ducts and eyes. My eyesight has already deteriorated".Gary reflects on his unique relationship with Prince Phillip: "Although I never met HRH I have always felt a unique kinship. Despite the vast size and ever-growing value of the crown estate despite having the ability to appoint prime ministers and veto parliamentary bills... despite all of that they're really just the same as us. Some might argue that HRH lived a life of unfathomable personal wealth and extraordinary privilege at the expense of the tax payer but I don't believe that because someone on twitter said it wasn't true and why would they lie?"."People should stop talking this country down" he added. "If only he had lived a few more months I'm convinced that the Brexit dividend being pumped into the NHS now would probably have saved his life. It's such bad timing".

Though seldom viewed or touched in person they remain in place solid and revisited through books periodicals photographs evening news u-tube and every other kind of communication.Prince Philip was in that way a constant almost a living monument. Always around curious vocal following the Queen but never diminished by her.The lament is that he passed at age 99. The wish was that he would live forever.He didn’t suffer fools. Who does? Walk on.The Prince was one of the first who voiced a warning about air pollution climate change and preserving the planet. Years ago that was considered whimsical. Walk on.Today the world has finally caught up with those warnings and recognized the necessity of preserving the planet. The youth carry that banner while some seniors are invested in looking for another planet. Walk on.At Hyde Park the Queen and Prince were supposed to exit soon. No one knew or would say from which exit. Roll the dice. After an hour and a half of waiting down the road came the Rolls Royce. Camera in hand without a crowd they would pass right in front. See them in person or through the lens while taking the picture. The picture was taken—many regrets.Lots of reflection and burning in the darkroom. Finally the photograph of the Queen and Prince appeared. No regrets. It’s a constant.Sinatra still sings. The pyramids are standing. Everest is there. The moon isn’t going anywhere. That incredible dapper-dressed amazing Prince will remain in hearts with the same wonder affection and admiration.Monuments are a constant.Read more by this author:

Afterward he noticed that the on course announcer near him made sure to say 'Great shot from Abraham Ancer—who has duel citizenship from Mexico and the U.S.A.''OK?' Chip thought to himself "...no big deal' but his ears became tuned to it for the rest of the day. On the 8th hole the same announcer said about Carlos Ortiz also from Mexico after an amazing eagle from the bunker 'Don't worry folks he has his papers in order.''That's a little strange?' Chip thought.Then on the 13th Chip watched Joaquin Neimann from Chilé hole a double breaking 45 foot putt and overheard on his simulcast earpiece '...not to worry folks we are almost certain Neimann is a DACA recipient.''Ok what's going on here?' our brave man Fairway declared. He was sure he saw a bathroom for 'Colored People' over by the Butler Cabin—so what gives? Are we racist here or not?He went searching for answers. And believe it or not a balding white guy with a floppy saggy beer belly had them.'Oh the funny little sign over yonder by the Butler Cabin?' That's just a funny little joke between members' explained Binkie Jackwagon Augusta National's Assistant PR person in charge of Racial Gaffs and Giffs. 'We usually remember to take that down before the Master's? Opsie! Looks like someone's gettin' deported! Haha. Sorry that's just another lil' ole Augusta member only joke—We don't actually hire illegals no more."Mr. Jackwagon admitted that the tournament had been warned from Top Law Enforcement that they were tracking a lot of social media chatter about the number of 'non-American' participants at this year's tournament. "Yessir Twitter users at the popular 'Birdies n' Nooses' fan page were lightin' up the FBI watch list like fried grits on a Chevy Impala in July" told Jackwagon. "So they gave us a holler.""Also we were feeling some heat from some 'hippie-dippy' liberal organizations from over in Atlanta to make some sort of statement after the old Jim Crowe voting laws were signed into law last week. So this is what we agreed to do: Please don't call immigration on the fine contingent of Latin American players. We can assure you that we are almost certain that they are all allowed to be here in the United Staes. What else do I have to say?""And... by the way?" Jackwagon added 'What negro person wouldn't want a bathroom all to themselves these days with the Corona and stuff? Look around there ain't too many of 'em here. I'd be happier than a monkey with a big bunch of bananas to find a nice clean empty bathroom!'As Chipped walked away Jackwagon called after him"We did the Lee Elder thing for the Opening Ceremony! You gonna write about that right Chip? Black Lives Matter!"'The old bastard couldn't even swing a club....' we heard Jackwagon mumble under his breathe.
Tuesday 13 April 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152829/banksy-reveals-real-reason-why-trump-lost-the-2020-election,Banksy reveals real reason why Trump lost the 2020 election,There is a plethora of reasons why Trump lost the election to Sleepy Joe. Some of them hinge on the premise that Donald was always ‘awoke’-- playing golf clapping his hands applauding himself drinking Coke and munching burgers watching his on-and-off loyalists on Fox News developing a plump thumb twittering abuse playing the accordion when lecturing the press corps at the White House stumbling down ramps and signing off Executive Orders that invalidated all previous Executive decisions that carried Obama’s signature.Most common-sense commentators would agree that Covid 19 really sunk Trump’s prospects to win in 2020. After all half a million Americans (spouses siblings parents children and grandparents) lost their lives and millions more were infected by the ‘hoax’ that would disappear with a wave of his hand. Without an ounce of sympathy.Trump was immune to the hoax virus and refused to wear a mask. He was lucky that a few privileged people like him could be rushed to Walter Reed which has state-of-the-art medical facilities. Unfortunately there was no room for thousands of other Covid victims who had no WHO (White House Occupant) credentials.“Wear a mask” said Fauci. “Don’t listen to an idiot scientist” contradicted Doctor Donald Know-all. And the faithful heard him and ripped off their masks and hugged each other and were rushed to hospital.Why did Trump refuse to wear a mask? And thus send a deadly message of irrational behavior to his mob.Talkshow hosts on Fox News whipped up the frenzy that Trump was untouchable and immune. That the grim statistics were fake news cooked up by Democrats.But the real reason was that Trump had a Big Mouth and if he wore a mask at his rallies it would be hard to make out what he was saying. So off came the mask revealing King Pinocchio sporting the largest proboscis in US election history. A total of 30573 false or misleading claims over four years. Observers remarked that his intake of Big Macs and gallons of Diet Coke so preoccupied the Big Mouth that falsehoods averaged a mere 21 a day.Unsurprisingly Trump lost the election fair and square. He tried to steal it back with more false claims Fox News mendacity Legal Prevaricators and a mob of terrorists. And the courts stopped the Steal-It-Back.All because Trump did not wear a Mask. As Banksy the world’s most famous unidentified street artist said: “If you want to say something and have people listen to you… then you have to wear a mask.”Ask Fauci.

Thursday 15 April 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/uk/152834/princess-anne-s-son-stands-between-william-and-harry,Princess Anne’s Son Stands Between William And Harry,Well there’s another problem. First it was will William wear his military uniform for his grandfather's funeral? Since Harry quit the family business he has been stripped of his military uniform and history of deployment in Afghanistan.Gee whizz really? Harry served for two deployments in the most dangerous place on the planet. Yes he quit the family business but that leaves him nude of uniform and history? Come on that’s zero judgment.Please do not stop this writer next time this writer lands at Heathrow.Well the Palace explained It would seem odd for William to be dressed up in uniform and Harry nude so it was decided to keep William and Harry in dark suits. (Wasn't that the name of Harry's wife's TV program?)There was the question about Prince Andrew. He also served in uniform and also quit the family business and won’t be wearing a uniform.So nobody’s wearing a uniform for Prince Philip’s funeral except perhaps Prince Philip who is probably cursing a storm at this very moment.Anyway the uniform conflict solved apparently neither William nor Harry wanted to stand next to one another as they walked behind Philip’s casket to the funeral at the Windsor Chapel.Ayeeee!To keep them apart Queen Elizabeth dragged out another grandson (it’s like a shelf of Campbell soup) Princess Anne’s son Peter Philips. Peter Philips will thus walk between both brothers hopefully to prevent another Afghanistan breaking out during the procession behind Grandpa’s casket.Just about now Prince Philip is saying “I had this whole #%&@ thing planned and my two blood grandsons are screwing up everything! Does anyone appreciate what it takes to change a Land Rover into a hearse? It isn't like opening a can of tomatoes. Bloody spoiled brats!”Editor’s note: Prepare to be stopped next time you land at Heathrow.Read more by this author:

Waited on hand and foot every day during her Queendom by servants cooks ladies in waiting gentlemen in waiting gardeners chauffeurs and most importantly the horse people.Yes she had a supportive husband but hey women don’t necessarily collapse when the husband bites the dust two months before his 100 years old birthday. Women have to know it's coming.However her mother did live to be 101 plus 238 days so the Queen probably anticipated having him around for many more days.Oh well.It’s rumored she’s been having affairs with US presidents from Eisenhower to Barack Obama. Even a spin with George Bush and a gallop with Ronald Reagan.D. Trump did not make any list. He got lost at a parade.But the gal has three sons one daughter three grandsons five granddaughters four great-grandsons and five great-granddaughters. That's a slew. Ten that still require babysitters and granny’s available.And then there’s the United Kingdom Northern Ireland and fifteen Commonwealth realms. True she has MI5 and MI6 to help out with the kitty-gritty but the Queen has plenty of experience.As for the toned-down funeral? Respectful colorful dignified great pageantry. Biggest kick? That green Land Rover.But some may prefer having men wearing kilts performing in the Oom-pah Band and playing: Don't Fence Me In.Editor’s note: Be doubly prepared to be stopped next time you land at Heathrow.Read more by this author:
Tuesday 20 April 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/uk/152839/no-mystery-about-harry,No Mystery About Harry,It seems Harry made it to Great Britain for his 99-year-old grandfather's funeral and had to go into quarantine. 100% high marks for Harry. But how did he manage to escape LA? And for one whole week? Did he have to wear an ankle cuff?Wife Meghan didn’t make the trip to her husband’s 99-year-old grandfather’s funeral because she is pregnant and due in two months. However she did fly to New York six weeks before Archie was born to attend a baby shower.A baby shower or a funeral six weeks or two months it’s best that she remain at home. And what a perfect opportunity for the brothers William and Harry to get together for a beer and celebrate having had such an extraordinary individual for a grandfather and to also celebrate Granny's 95-year-old birthday.Make it a crypt party with all the children and grandchildren and Granny. The group would celebrate both Philip's life and Granny's 95-year-old birthday.The Duke of Edinburgh lived an extraordinary life and was a positive beacon for the family the nation and the world. Prince Philip managed to make it to a glorious 99 years. A celebration with a beer-blast party should be in order. Make it a yearly anniversary event. Bring out the Oom-pah band with men performing in kilts.Happy Birthday and Congrats to Philip for a life well-lived.So Harry gets back to LA a few days later than expected. It isn't as though he's a souffle.Read more by this author:

Think of adding ice cubes to a drink what happens? the drink becomes cold. This will happen to our oceans and my prediction of a new ice age will come true" said Dr. Boombatz in an interview.In 2010 Dr. Boombatz declared the climate crisis to be over and said there was no noticeable warming endearing him to Donald Trump and his followers.

The description was supplied by a helpful member of the public who wished to remain anonymous but who revealed seeing an orangutan-looking man with a wild expression using his thumbs to type messages on the Prime Minister’s phone.“We don’t know the identity of this fat bastard” said Metropolitan Commissioner Cressida Dick. “but we know he has been seen in the company of several different women suggesting he could be a sleazy fat bastard.”The government has had to deal with a number of leaks such as the recent resignation of Defence Minister Captain Johnny Mercer on a matter of principle. The leaks have been happening for years and even pre-date the Prime Minister’s accession to power. Former Prime Minister Theresa May was so concerned about leaks that she forbade Ministers from bringing their mobile phones to Cabinet meetings.Do you have any idea who the fat bastard with orange hair could be? If so please call the police straight-away so he can be arrested.

In Turner Classic black-and-white films police officers walked the beat in twos billy clubs at the waist know their neighborhood the residents by name and never have shoot outs or speed through streets in squad cars emulating Steve McQueen in Bullet.Today police officers' guns discharge accidentally or mistakenly or "gosh-gee" and an innocent citizen can be shot dead in bed at 3 AM. As taxpayers who pay the officer’s salary shot dead in bed is not the kind of return expected.Woe betide if you are black or brown or have a dark suntan. Color aside if you dare to have air fresheners hanging in your car you can be stopped arrested (if lucky) or shot dead (if unlucky).Taxpayers should not depend on luck. If an officer can’t distinguish a .8oz yellow taser from a black 1lb.8oz Gluck that officer should remain at a desk job. Also the officer should re-take the driver's license exam.Death comes too easily with a gun in hand. Police are supposed to protect the taxpayer not kill them. Taxpayers should not be treated like Al Qaeda or the Taliban.The Billy Club maintained law and order. Police officers in Turner Classic films were respected not feared. They were there to protect society not with a gun or a knee or a taser or tear gas.True like clocks time moves forward not backward. But in some parts of the USA it’s easier to buy a gun than to vote which is backward.Read more by this author:

The handle has the initials A.P.P. for Arthur Pablo Pendragon.According to Reginald Dancer a noted British historian the sword was a birthday present to Arthur from his Welsh uncle Cardigard Quickenberry 59 who was noted for having invented Welsh Grape Jelly whose spelling was later changed to Welch in the winter of 1783.The manager of the MoTown Pawn Shop Willie LeBron Franklin said that the sword had been brought in by a 16-year-old girl high school cheerleader who said she found it underneath the football stadium bleachers at Mrs. Henry Ford High School.Mr. Dancer said that he estimates the sword’s value to be somewhere between $87500 and $7.2 million.
Monday 26 April 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152854/biden-announces-new-gun-reforms,Biden Announces New Gun Reforms,President Joe Biden has announced sweeping changes to US gun laws in an attempt to halt the rising incidences of police and mass shootings."All guns will be modified to fire gobs of whipped cream instead of bullets. Like in Bugsy Malone" said the President at the morning White House press briefing."Instead of receiving a mortal injury those hit will be covered in a splurge of sweet dairy. I think it will deter crime (no one wants to be covered in cream - especially in the summer) and though mass shootings could still occur it would be easier for the police to prevent them by having a system in place where grocery stores report when a customer buys an excessive amount of Reddi Whip."However some groups including The American Lactose Intolerant Society have expressed concerns."This would prove fatal to our members or lead to bouts of diarrhea and tummyache if caught in any crossfire. Even what could be described as a graze or flesh wound a tiny glob of cream just touching one of us could be disastrous. I think we would rather take our chances with lead."
Monday 26 April 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/entertainment-gossip/147249/24-hours-in-ae-the-missing-episodes,24 Hours in A&E: the Missing Episodes,Hospital insider Paxton Quigley who wishes to remain anonymous has revealed in confidence to The Spoof how some episodes of 24 Hours in A&E were deemed unfit for public broadcast by the hospital due to their graphic deeply upsetting content and on the grounds of offending public decency whatever that is. He spoke to our Entertainments Editor Plagny Toxique.“You know how each episode starts: This south London hospital is one of the most advanced hospitals in the world blah blah blah…then you get small cameos of people sitting around playing Candy Crush on their phones and that’s just the staff. Then of course it becomes more serious. Some little staff nurse eventually hears that red phone ringing and drags herself away from her phone and Facebook or Instagram whatever before announcing an ambulance is on its way. Then of course for effect you see an ambulance taking the scenic route around south London tourist attractions: Balham Sewing Machine Museum Colliers Wood TK Maxx Tooting Bec Lido you know the kind of thing.“But on several occasions there have been some unsavoury cases which would have shocked the public. Needless to say they were of an intimate nature but the patients didn’t object to their medical conditions being broadcast nationwide after all doesn’t everyone want to be on TV? Despite that the hospital vetoed the episodes.“One bizarre case saw a couple self-presenting the woman with a badly bruised face and the man with serious bite marks to his genitalia. It seems that the pair was in flagrante delicto when the female decided to perform oral sex on him but unfortunately she had a brief epileptic fit while doing it and bit down hard. Very hard. Of course he had to try to fight her off.“Then there was the case of an elderly man who was brought in with severe stomach cramps. On being X-rayed it turned out that he had an Errol Flynn size vibrator lodged in his descending colon. When questioned about it at first he claimed to have been assaulted on Clapham Common by “a gang of youths” before admitting that he had lost the offending item some days before and couldn’t remember where he had left it. Anyway removing the article required major surgery but now he is suing the hospital saying that after all our efforts he only wanted the batteries changed.“The most mind-boggling incident saw two people being brought in on one ambulance trolley locked together. It was a classic case of acute vaginismus whereby the female’s lady parts have clamped tight on the male member and it can cause serious injury to the intruder I can tell you. I have had a close call like this myself long ago with my teenage girlfriend but that’s another story. It turned out that the lady in question was a well-known local working girl and of course when the man’s next of kin his wife arrived in the department all hell broke loose. The man’s denial that he knew the woman in any way just wasn’t accepted I mean she was still bent over the trolley with him in situ so of course it wouldn’t wash and they were like that for several hours until the lady was anaesthetised in order to prise him out of her.“Now I am sure you’ve seen those pieces where the relatives talk directly to camera and say what a wonderful person he/she is/was. Those scenes irk me with their mawkishness and make want to me reach for a sick bag. I always want the person to say that s/he was a sh*t and on this occasion the wife didn’t disappoint. I have some pithy quotes from her interview:“He was a real dirty b*stard up until then. After a few pints of Gnatspisz Pils he’d shag anything that moved and I was forever down at the special clinic getting treated for what he’d picked up….Of course after his todger was starved of blood for several hours it got gangrene and I’m glad he’s had to have it amputated. That’ll teach him.”

Alpo.The 8-foot by 9-foot sign reads “I have to move to Cape Cod mucho pronto!”The word on Rodeo Drive is that the world’s most richest man Elon Musk plans to buy both homes.When he was asked if he wasn’t afraid of both homes getting fried by the meteor he just laughed and remarked that he is working 24-7 on developing an industrial-sized meteor zapper capable of reducing the meteor to microscopic meteor dust.Musk noted that Zappy The 1st should be operational within 13 days.

She would perform the Gloria Swanson role while Harry in the Bill Holden role.They need the money as both are out of work and just purchased a 9-bedroom 16-bathroom $14.7 million home. That's one giant monthly mortgage.While the Bill Holden role was rather one-dimensional and required little acting ability Harry should be able to walk straight through that role and into the swimming pool without much coaching.The Gloria Swanson role on the other hand will be more of a challenge for Mrs. Mountbatten Windsor as her performances in the television series Suits only required memorizing lines and knowing where to stand.While waiting for her staircase scene and his swimming pool scene there’s a substantial amount of dialogue going on back and forth with the butler. In the original Sunset Boulevard film that role was performed by Austrian actor Eric Von Stroheim.The butler role in the Mountbatten Windsor version is up for grabs with Brad Pitt as the most likely and Meryl Streep a close second. She can do anything.To cut costs actor and this time film director Clint Eastwood suggested using the 9-bedroom 16-bathroom Montecito mansion belonging to the Windsors for the new Sunset Boulevard film set. Adding they had to pay for those 16-bathrooms someway.“Think of the resale value and there’s already a swimming pool.”Fingers still crossed.Read more by this author:

Tuesday 27 April 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152859/nashville-man-s-vaccine-hesitancy-forces-him-to-face-difficult-personal-truth,Nashville Man’s Vaccine Hesitancy Forces Him to Face Difficult Personal Truth,Disconcerted to find himself suffering from a recalcitrant case of COVID vaccine hesitancy Hector Romano of Nashville Tennessee embarked on a journey to understand his own motives – and wound up confronting some painful personal truths.“I’m a sociopath” he said. “It’s the only possible explanation. Either that or I’m possessed by the devil. But the sociopath thing seems more likely.”Romano went on to describe the thought process that led to his ultimate conclusion that he is a sociopath.“It was bizarro” he said referring to his initial instinctive reluctance to avail himself of the emergency-authorized injection produced by companies like Pfizer and its subsidiaries which over past decades have been assessed $3 billion in criminal convictions civil penalties and jury awards. “I’d never before experienced any desire to think independently or take ownership over my own health decisions. So why was I looking for any and every excuse not to get this latest greatest jab?”Determined to understand his vaccine hesitancy Romano decided to probe deeper first considering exploring whether he could possibly unbeknownst to even himself be an anti-vaxer.That wasn’t it he found. “I can only assume that being anti-vax requires some basic working knowledge of vaccines” he said. “And I’m just not a science guy. Honestly I wouldn’t even know where to start.”Romano next wondered whether his injection-aversion could conceivably stem from the fact that COVID vaccine manufacturers are immune from liability for vaccine-related injuries.He quickly dismissed that theory as well. “I’m not litigious and I’m also not very organized" he said. "Honestly even if a shot did really mess me up I can’t see myself getting my act together enough to sue anyone. So no skin off my back if these companies are protected.”Romano likewise rejected the theory that what was fueling his vaccine hesitancy was that the novel new mRNA injection had been authorized only for emergency use and was not FDA-approved. "If anything not having FDA approval is a badge of honor" he pointed out. "Do you know the kind of garbage they’ve approved?”Last but not least Romano considered the possibility that after weighing the risks of the untested-on-humans COVID-19 injection against the risks of becoming infected with a disease with a 0.3-percent mortality rate he’d made an informed decision to brave the latter rather than the former.Frank self-assessment forced him to reject that theory too. “Weighing pros and cons isn't exactly my style" said Romano. "And I’m pretty big on taking dangerous risks.”Having discarded all other possible explanations Romano was left to conclude that his vaccine hesitancy could only be indicative that he suffers from the personality disorder that manifests itself in extreme antisocial attitudes and utter lack of conscience. “Sheer process of elimination" he said shaking his head.

No.Then came the runny hair dye incident. No again.But April 28 up popped Giuliani the same day as Joe Biden’s first State of the Union Speech. A teeter-totter kind of day. Or eloquence versus the raid.Federal agents executed search warrants Wednesday morning at 6. They raided the Upper East Side Manhattan apartment and Park Avenue offices of Rudolph Giuliani much to Giuliani’s surprise distaste and ten-minute critique on the invasion of his privacy.And they were not looking for his hair dye recipe.Agents took all of his electronic and WiFi communicating devices mobile phones and computers.

Thursday 29 April 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/uk/152862/the-pope-is-accused-of-genocide,The Pope is Accused of Genocide!,Parliament voted today to endorse a motion accusing the Catholic Church authorities of committing genocide against humanity in its treatment of priests and the European race.Around 1 million European and Catholic priests are believed to have been mistreated by church doctrine. Mandated Celibacy and Optional Celibacy of priests is an act of genocide intent by the Catholic Church. The requirement of a monogamous marriage amongst Catholic followers is also an act of genocide against the European race perpetrated by the Catholic Church since it prevents the birth of children.Today’s motion was submitted by Nusrat Ghani a Conservative member of parliament who was recently sanctioned by the Catholic Church for her work on this issue. It is non-binding and passed by a unanimous voice vote.It’s the latest instance of parliamentarians wading into a controversial question that governments have generally preferred to avoid.By deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group is the crime of genocide that the Catholic Church is guilty of committing.Under the legal constructions of genocide liability for genocide extends to those who “planned instigated ordered committed or otherwise aided and abetted in the planning preparation or execution” of one or more of the aforementioned genocidal acts [ICTY Art. 7(1)]. This includes the Pope and the Holly order that enforce the genocide through punishment and brainwashing on its members.In general both public and private individuals are punishable [ICTY Art. 7(2)]. Leaders such as the Italian Parliament can be held accountable for the criminal actions of the Pope and the Catholic Church if they knew or should have known about the actions on Italians and foreigners and failed to prevent or punish them [ICTY Art. 7(3); Krstic ICTY Appellate Judgment § 140].

I guess I better put my house up for sale.”Meanwhile team owner Shahid Khan was asked by the assembled sports media “Why???”Khan giggled like a schoolgirl and replied that 19 years ago he read a book about the great legendary Green Bay Packers coach Vince Lombardi.He went on to say that he got the idea for drafting 3 kickers from Lombardi's book which is titled “Buy and Read My Book – And You Too Can Be A Fabulously Fantastic Winner.”

What’s the point of writing film scripts? What’s the point of employing actors? Perhaps not much if people can't learn something life-giving from films.There’s no point in making films about World War ll explaining how the world was responsible for atrocities for not acting sooner against Nazi terrorists. There’s no point in making films about the social divide like Les Misérables. And there’s no point either in making films about anti-Semitism like J’accuse. Because in the end nobody gives a cack.The film industry seizes on the opportunity to make money from cinematic drama. How about seeking a reason to live and perhaps to survive in an evolutionary challenged world?Marvel's Hulk spends time smashing everything he sees but fails to set aside time to explain how the economy fails.In this world of appearances and play-acting it would seem that every film should have a positive message that young people can grow up with.Does the cinema only believe in values that it claims to share with its filmgoers? Is the cinema nothing more than a business with prize-giving ceremonies to keep the public’s attention?Mindless people on the front row smart people at the back of the class.When we were kids deserving pupils were rewarded with good grades at the end of the school year. Practically everyone got a little something in the form of education.Using math to equate time spent watching fictional movies on a major scale would show 30 years a day of arrested development for the human race.We pay the government's to fix the problem but nothing is accomplished as the world deficit increases.A bee colony accomplishes more; look at how much honey we have in the store.The latest César award ceremony was a bit like that. Polanski had to be punished. Therefore he had to be denied recognition as a good film-maker and for having related interesting things to filmgoers in the story of J’accuse. In other words none of this work was of any value. But if what Polanski believed when he made J’accuse is of no significance why should the messages conveyed by the other directors in their films be of any greater interest?Cows don't care for the same reason people don't care.Maybe in the future when humanity's I.Q. reaches a level of 1000 as opposed to the current level of 120 they will fix their problems. With more mental awareness how could they not.For now some people can continue dreaming of a better world - there are no admission fees for that.

It is due to the country air and fresh smell of manure which tends to turn the heat up. As for feline farm cats they have so much choice for a partner they spend all day flattering their rear-ends and then doing a mighty runner before several hot male cats get a chance to pounce. All in all it is quite amusing observing farm cats at this time of year.However one German huge male black cat with his tongue hanging out took his 'wooing' too far. His target in question a ginger feline kept him busy for several days but every time the male attempted to mount her he got a huge 'left hook!' She then run off teasing the poor thing to hell.At a final attempt to mount her he followed her on top of a baking hot tin roof she lay their sun-bathing. He approached silently was about to leap but his hanging heavy 'cojones' touched the hot tin roof he yowled in agony and jumped into a convenient rain barrel standing under the guttering.Later that day the ginger feline revealing a satisfied cat smile appeared after a 'rumble in the jungle' with a less gentle pursuer a ginger knob. As for the 'hot cat on the hot tin roof' he is now nursing his 'pride and joy' in a muddy puddle hoping he will be more fortunate next year!

Biden is the legally elected President of the United States. Right?Everyone already voted. Right? The election was over last year. Right? The majority voted for Biden. Right?So Biden won. The Pussy Grabber lost.Even children recognize Biden won fair and square.Why did Trump lose? Well the Pussy Grabber sat on his hands for the previous four years but gave the country away to Russia and China. Before that he gave the top super-rich 3% in the USA a tax break. The top super-rich 3% said "Bingo!"Trump started a Space Force to fight a possible maybe threat from outer space. Before the Space Force Trump dismantled the Pandemic Defense Team started by President Obama. When the COVID pandemic hit on planet earth Trump's solution was to suggest everyone drink Lysol and Clorox.Aware of Trump’s zero leadership ability the nation voted him out of office. So long and good-bye Donald Trump."No no no" said Trump. “Biden stole the election. I really won.” Quivering Republicans in the House of Representatives agreed. “Trump really won.”The only Republican woman member in a leadership position in the House of Representatives who spoke out against Trump's claim was Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming. “Trump did not win.”So guess who the Republicans in the House are going to remove from her leadership position in the House of Representatives?Liz Cheney of Wyoming.Too bad the House Republican Party members can't do better than the Pussy Grabber.Read more by this author:

Friday 7 May 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152897/update-on-the-donald-j-trump-pos-award,Update on The Donald J Trump POS Award,The Donald J Trump POS Award Foundation appreciates the positive response to its mission and the nominations it has received from the general public.This update will discuss two nominations for the award.The first is Donald J. Trump himself. The second is the bootlicking tandem of Senators Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz both of whom are Ivy League trained lawyers.There is certainly an argument that no one deserves the award more than Trump himself.As the nominator noted: “Trump is still the biggest POS in 2021 politics.”Nonetheless it seems like a stretch at least to us to give Trump an award that is named after him.It just doesn’t seem quite right to say something like: “The winner of this year’s Donald J. Trump POS award is Donald J. Trump.”There is also a case that Hawley and Cruz the Trumpian sycophants who worked tirelessly to advance the “stop the steal narrative” by introducing legislation and taking positions that they knew was unconstitutional and unsupported are certainly PsOS.The question however is not whether they are PsOS but whether they are Trumpian PsOS?Those who say yes can point to their amorality lack of judgement and disregard for facts. They seem to fall short however on the narcissism metric.Arguably these two sleaze balls were more infatuated with Trump than they were with themselves and certainly wrecked their legacies if not their careers.For these reasons Andrew Cuomo is still the frontrunner for this year’s prize.As we noted before however most of the year is still ahead of us so there’s plenty of time for competition to Cuomo to arise.Next time we’ll discuss two other nominations we have received: Matt Gaetz the loud mouthed congressman from the Florida Panhandle who supposedly likes underage girls and the Albany Press corps which for years covered up for Cuomo.In the meantime keep your nominations coming.

Friday 7 May 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152889/sanford-disarms-human-police-macaque-monkeys-to-control-all-weaponry,Sanford disarms human police: Macaque monkeys to control all weaponry,On Tuesday evening the Sanford City Council passed a controversial new ordinance that removes all deadly weapons from the hands of traditional law enforcement officers and arms highly-skilled macaque monkeys in their place. The macaques must first complete an 18 month training program and an extensive series of tests in order to qualify for duty.The Primate Elite Corps (PEC) is comprised of best-in-breed subjects that have completed a rigorous program. They are trained to identify threats and respond accordingly. The main advantage these monkeys have over their human counterparts stems from their ability to view all people as equals regardless of race creed color political affiliations fashion choices or hair styles.“We select only the best and brightest here and they are trained thoroughly” said Fred Wilbur CEO of PEC “and you can be sure any of our graduates will know when to pull the trigger and how to mitigate a threats appropriately.” Wilbur went on to explain that the macaques are trained to aim low when facing unarmed suspects and believes this practice will end unnecessary fatal shootings that have been taking lives at a rate of almost one per week over the past several years in the US.Approximately 30 police officers and family members stood outside of Sanford City Hall protesting the vote. They became more vocal after the vote was announced. One angry officer who declined to give his name told us; “My wife lost her job to a computer ok? But if you’d told me I’d get screwed by these &#@$% monkeys I’d [have] said you’re nuts!” A few officers held a signs reading GUNS ARE 4 PEOPLE. One of those officers was heard shouting “I never shot nobody!” Many signs included expletives with messages that disparaged the monkeys and/or stating that deadly weapons belong in police hands.Mayor Jake P. Johansen who has been a macaque supporter stressed that there are no lay-offs currently planned. All currently active officers will be reassigned as drivers for the macaques.Under the current plan each patrol car will include two human officers one a driver and a second riding “shotgun”. A PEC macaque will occupy the back seat and control all weaponry. Officer will also assist with routine situations when no decision-making is required.Sanford Police Chief Oscar Mingora seemed both skeptical and relieved after the vote was announced “We’ll have to wait and see how these monkeys handle things but I am glad the pressure is off my people to make snap decisions in the heat of the action out there. It’s a lot tougher than you think!”Initially it was thought that the chimpanzee would be used in this capacity but early program results fell short of expectations. “Chimps have a violent nature” Wilbur explained. “They’re very intelligent creatures so we had high hopes with them early on but based on their performance our models projected they’d only be a slight improvement over humans.” PEC scrapped the program after a series of mishaps in which several chimps were killed or injured due to “reckless behaviors”. They ultimately went with macaques because of their more subdued nature and along with their comparable intelligence.On a parting note the mayor proclaimed “All the good citizens of Sanford can be counted as true friends of law enforcement in any form that best prioritizes public safety”

The thrice-divorced Ms. Winterspoon informed the news media that other states are also starting to give individuals incentives to get vaccinated but no state not even California has a deal that matches Mississippi’s offer.Winterspoon noted that the state of Georgia is handing out 3 peaches per person and pointed out that New Jersey is giving shot participants $12 gift certificates for cheese bagels from anyone of the hundreds of Bagel Babe Bistros located throughout the state.Meanwhile the state of Texas has informed its citizens that after individuals get their COVID-19 shots they can then head to the nearest La Chupacabra Bar & Grill show your vaccine card and receive a ‘free’ plate of barbecue brisket sausage and fajitas with all of the trimmings (including two Lone Star longneck beers).SIDENOTE: Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James heard about the free bale of cotton deal and he said that he is encouraging all of his Mississippi fans to get their shots as soon as possible.

Chinese Rocket Falls On Elmer Smuckmeister’s Out House,BILLINGSGATE POST: “WTF!” The chances of hitting a populated area are small but not zero. The Long March 5B rocket carrying China’s Tianhe space station from the Wenchang Space Launch Center in southern China on April 29 was carried out despite the remote chance that anyone would be hit by a 10-story 23-ton piece of rocket hurtling back to Earth.That said the chances were not zero as Elmer Smuckmeister a retired farmer living peacefully on the outskirts of Beaver Crossing Nebraska found out. Although 71 percent of the Earth is covered by oceans where the rocket debris was hoped to fall somehow it landed right on top of Elmer’s outhouse just a short distance from his house.Smuckmeister an old timer who looks at the modern conveniences of indoor plumbing as being anti-environmental didn’t mind getting up in the middle of the night to take a dump in his three-holer during a blizzard even when the temperature read -20 degree Fahrenheit.Although he is a Trump conservative his one concession to Joe Biden’s environmental program was to take a big dump in his outhouse and dedicate it to Dementia Joe and his side kick Kamala Harris.A true Patriot every time Elmer farted he would say: “Here’s a kiss for Biden.”Last night with all the odds seemingly in his favor Elmer decided to take his two girlfriends Irma and Milada out for a midnight ménage e trois poop-a-thon in his three-holer. After tidying up with pages torn from an old Sears Roebuck catalog they had just stepped into Elmer’s living room when the outhouse was hit. The explosion was felt in Omaha and Lincoln with shit flying through the air like brown snowflakes; none identical but stinking non-the-less.“Holy F*ck!” exclaimed Elmer. “That could’ve been us.”Dr. Slim: “The odds of that happening were ass-tronomical.”Dirty: “Yo Doctor. I hope Elmer rebuilds after this. Perhaps he can put in for a stimulus loan.”

It is known as a shady seemingly hallucinatory (or a hallucinating group) led by a mysterious Being who is known only by his pen name 'Q'.Could it be that not-so-mysterious spy gadget inventor Q from the James Bond series who invented all those over the top gizmos that gave Mister 'Shaken not Stirred ' his competitive edge over the bad guys? The one who was last played quite tongue in cheek by John Cleese of Monty Python fame? I don't think so.Could it be the wily super omnipotent Being Q from Star Trek- The Next Generation who battled wits with Captain Picard so brilliantly? No that was set in the far future and we are not there yet. We are having a difficult time enough dealing with our present.Could it be Putin who I already suggested and roasted in another article? That would make sense; he likes playing with American gullibilities and we have a lot of them at the moment.No I think this is a totally new and original Q original except that he probably came up with his moniker from watching too much James Bond Star Trek and FOX News.Whatever and whoever that answer is the name of the organization is as much of a mystery as it's mouthpiece is. Just what do the initials 'Q'Anon stand for any way? We could be mislead by the seemingly obvious that it means Q Anonymous but that would be too easy. We need to show a little more depth than its followers and determine its real meaning.Here are the possibilities hacked up mentally so far:Quacks Administrating Nonsense and Obvious Nuttiness.Qualifying As Not Overly Normal.Quarreling Almost Non-stop Over Non-entities.Quenchlessly Asserting Newfound Ominous Notions.Quaint Asinine Nuts Originating Nightmares.Querimoniously Attempting New Overthrow of Nation.Questionably Aberrant No-brainer Obnoxious Notions.Queasily Alarming Neanderthalish Oral Narratives.Quicksand-like Arguments Nominally Outlandishly and NonsensicalQuasi Abnormal Naughty Occultic Numb-skullsQueerly Anonymous Nutcases Orating Nonsense.Queasily Approximating Nitwit Objectives Nefariously.Quarter-brained Angry Notoriously Obnoxious Numb-nuts.Quavering Always Numbly Over Nothing.Quizzically Always Never On Note.Quite Annoying Nauseatingly Ornery and Neurotic.Quipping Abundant New Offensive Nasties.Quaffing Amounts of Narcotics Orally Normally.Quantum A**holes Numbifying Ordinary Norms.Quixotic Anarchic Non-functionals Obliterating Nation.If you can come up with more you have a dictionary with more 'Q's' in it than I do........

Mr. Gun in his lawsuit claims that he has been passed over for roles that depict various type of criminals doing various unlawful acts. Speaking for his cell mates he claims that they too have been left out of the equation.“It just isn’t right” lamented Gun. “Who knows more about being a criminal than a criminal?”“Just think about how much more realistic a scene would look when a real mugger does the mugging or a true arsonist burns down a movie studio. Criminal behavior is manifested in the lawbreaker. Diversity also plays a role. How many real delinquents are there in Hollywood movies? Not many I Can assure you. All we are asking for is fair representation”.“How would you like it if you were a nose picker and in a Hollywood movie they had a serial nose picker who wasn’t a nose picker? Wouldn’t that upset you being passed over like that? Honestly it is the same as a frog who has had his legs cut off. The frog can’t jump any higher than a dead ant. This is why I am speaking on behalf of all criminals. We need fair representation”.When asked about Mr. Gun’s lawsuit Sherry Flick the spokeswoman for Killing People Film Productions replied: “We have had delinquents in the past in some of our movies. In one case we had a real mass murderer play a role but he ended up killing the entire cast before we could finish the movie which really put us in a bind. We had to go out and find ourselves a real police officer to play the part of a peace officer and had him arrest the terminator”.As of press time New York congress woman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez claimed that by eliminating all the prisons there would no longer be a need for criminals to play roles in movies because there would no longer be anyone who is an offender. “They could all be in Congress where they would thrive”.

As a grandfather he is old enough to remember the 1980s when this was Labour territory. After Thursday's by-election it isn't Labour any more.He moaned "This place has been going soft ever since that film Billy Elliot. No wonder they're all voting Tory now they're a bunch of pansies. They wouldn't even know what the inside of a coal mine looks like. It's unseemly."Grimm is one of many older inhabitants of the town who stuck with Labour yet they were outnumbered by the larger numbers of Tory voters many of whom came from the younger generation or who had never voted Conservative before.Jif Fresh is an influencer who voted for the Tories. Aged just 19 she had never seen the inside of a polling station before. "It was great. I livestreamed it on my Wotbox. Then they told me to switch off the camera and I was like ok boomer! I've got like seventy followers on Wotbox and OnlyFap and they all want to watch me vote live. Some of them even paid me."Fresh decided to vote Conservative because her favourite colour is blue. She claimed to like Boris Johnson as well. "He's funny in't he. I never saw his comedy show it's too boring for me. I'd rather watch Jefferson Hell on TikTok - he ate a pigeon! Did you see that? Did you though? That was well funny."The Labour party are said to be in disarray after the loss. Leader Keir Starmer couldn't understand it. "We've got our best people analysing the situation and we think it's something to do with the fact that I went to the same school as Boris."

I thought it was very demeaning. Even in that day and age!” He added with some obvious anger mixed with his sadness. It was at that point Fauci ordered the cameras to stop rolling taking out a polka-dot handkerchief and covering his face as Stahl sadly looked on.

A Male Member-Friendly Popcorn Box!,Late yesterday the Weifang Packada Eco-friendly Technology Corporation announced it has completed field-testing for a “penis-friendly” popcorn container.The container designated as the WADAWAY21™ has undergone trials in 14 markets around the world and the early returns have brought about solid even eye-popping results!A "soft" launch is planned for early June.The WADAWAY21™ is designed with a penis-friendly EasyPass Spout™ on the bottom. The spout is made with a highly pliable soft rubber that fits snugly around the inserted penis to prevent leakage.There have been concerns that the containers might leak when smaller members are involved but Weifang assures that trials using smaller penis sizes have resulted in minimal leakage.When pressed about those results the company spokesman Wei Dong explained “As long as [the] man [is at least] partway excited package [will] work just fine” Wei Dong is the Chief Marketing Officer at Weifang Packada. He also added “But they must carefully follow instructions to remove member from container…” referring to a three-step procedure required when the user decides to remove his penis from the container.Dong also remarked that Weifang product designers had assumed theater-goers will not be dressed formally and any incidental spills should not cause significant damage.Dong also revealed to us that design plans are in the works for a urination package that they hope to test by autumn 2021.Once it’s made available the EasyPass Spout is expected help revive the cinema business and get audiences back in movie theaters. Industry experts predict it will transform the theater experience for male audience members.One expert we spoke with Chet Gismac predicted that with the WADAWAY product launch studios will be angling to bring back the romantic comedy genre (AKA chick-flicks) a genre that went out of fashion during the past decade.From our rumor mills we are hearing that the R&D and product development that resulted in the WADAWAY offering was largely funded by AMC Theaters Regal Entertainment Corp. and a private concern representing actors Hugh Grant and Kevin Costner. Corporate spokespeople at Weifang Packada declined comment on funding sources.Asked about product distribution Dong was unclear saying only that the WADAWAY will be offered to theaters and also will be available for the general public through sellers like Amazon Alibaba and a variety of specialty outlets.

Monday 10 May 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/152917/alita-battle-angel-2-the-last-kingdom-movie-plot,Alita Battle Angel 2: 'The Last Kingdom' Movie - Plot,In the year 2563 exactly 300 years after Earth was devastated by a catastrophic war known as "The Fall" Alita talks to Dr. Dyson Ido in his workshop before her final Motorball game which will make her eligible to enter Zalem.Dr. Dyson Ido explains to her that it will be too difficult to defeat Nova on her own."He most likely has a large security force protecting him on Zalem" says Ido.Alita returns to the old underwater URM ship to search for clues to a possible solution in defeating Nova. Unable to find anything of value she gets curious about where the ship came from. She activates the ship's black box to view its original mapped trajectory. The initial launch point shows an area 381.9 miles east of Iron City in a desert. She estimated it would be a 4-hour trip using a jet hovercraft.Alita travels to the desert location but the launch point is barren. She uses a radio wave musical code she attained from the sunken ship which is used to locate hidden URM ships and military bases.After playing the melody a hidden elevator rises out of the sand. She takes the elevator and finds herself in an underground military command base with several dozen ships a large fuel supply various types of weapons and a supply of ammunition. While inspecting the facility she discovers 400 URM soldiers in hibernation sleep.Alita taps her fingers on a translucent control panel and wakes them from their sleep. The leader of the unit tells her that they are the reinforcement for the battle against Zalem.She tells them the battle for Zalem was lost 300 years ago and her commander wasn't able to activate the reinforcement.Alita tells them that she needs their help to destroy Nova.She explains "After I'm accepted into Zalem I plan to deactivate the defence ring on the supply tube so that your unit can climb the tube to fulfill our quest to destroy Nova."After winning the Motorball games Nova signs an order to accept Alita into Zalem. She's asked to prove her loyalty to the city of Zalem by fighting as a gladiator in Zalem's coliseum. After beating three difficult opponents she gets an audience with Nova who tells Alita that she has met all of his expectations and he wants her to be his apprentice so she can help him to rule Zalem under his political theories. Nova tells Alita that he wants to make her general of his droid army. He confides in her that he suspects someone in Zalem is leading a rebel force against him but he's having a difficult time finding them.Zapan enters the room and is instructed by Nova to give Alita a tour of the city. While on tour Zapan and Alita are attacked by rebel assassins. Zapan saves Alita's life and they fall in love with each other. Alita's outlook on life converts Zapan into a kind and loving individual. When they tour Nova's droid factory she discovers that her Panzer Kunst instructor Gelda and three URM soldiers are still alive and they are working as slaves buildings military droids.Alita secretly follows Gelda to her flat and they talk. Gelda explains that she is the commander of the hidden rebel army on Zalem and very soon they plan an attack on Nova. Alita tells Gelda that she saw thousands of droids being constructed but she hasn't seen a single one walking around Zalem. Gelda tells her that Nova has been shipping the droids to a secret military base on earth to build an army to keep Iron City under control and he hopes to use the droid army against the colony on Mars to conquer a new home for the growing population of Zalem.The rebellion breaks out and Nova summons Alita to his laboratory. He tells her that he has a reserve of 500 droids on Zalem and he has released them on the rebels. He orders Alita to aid the droids in destroying the rebellion. Alita leaves and hides from sight waiting for Nova to leave she then breaks into his lab and destroys the control panel for the defense rings. Alita then sends a signal to the URM reinforcement waiting in Iron City to join the rebellion. Zapan no longer a hunter warrior joins the rebellion to help Alita free the innocent people of Zalem.After the droids on Zalem lose the battle Nova escapes on a ship with a group of upper-class elite who have kept Nova in power through rigged elections. They head to the secret droid military base on Earth to join 500000 droid soldiers to retake Zalem.Gelda orders Alita and the rebellion to attack Nova's military base on earth. She tells Alita that hidden on the moon there is an URM army of one million with ships and weapons. They were ordered to guard the DNA codes of three million URM people who are to be used to establish a settlement on the earth in the future. They also guard URM scientific researcher's who are advancing URM technologies. She tells Alita that she will take a ship and head to the moon to ask the URM army to help her against Nova's droid army on earth.During the battle at Nova's military base the rebels are at the point of losing the battle when they hear a large explosion and they see that the entrance to the base has been blown away. A million URM soldiers enter along with two million blue-colored URM droids. Within an hour the battle is over and Nova loses. Alita finds Nova crushed under an URM military vehicle. He looks at Alita and his last dying words are "I made a mistake for underestimating you; I didn't see this coming."After Nova dies a chip in his brain sends out his memories through a wave signal to the mind of a hibernating clone on Zalem. Nova is reincarnated and quickly enters a ship and heads to Venus in hopes of getting political asylum.The people of Zalem and the URM people from the moon join the humans of Iron City to live together in peace as one unified race on earth creating the last kingdom.

Monday 10 May 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/sport/152915/wiggins-comes-clean-on-his--lost-daddy--complex,Wiggins comes clean on his “lost daddy” complex,After years of therapy Jermaine “Wiggy” Wiggins has made a major breakthrough.On the Greg Hill morning radio show this morning Wiggy announced he’s just gone through a life altering change realizing his fixation for certain NFL players stem from his childhood.Wiggy was raised by his single mom who was Italian. He never met his father who was black.“He was never in the picture.” Wiggy told us with a sad smile. “I always wished he was around but he wasn’t. That’s it.”The good news however is that Wiggy now knows how his thinking and behaviors are impacted by those childhood experiences.Over the past year despite all evidence to the contrary Wiggy has endorsed and supported Cam Newton as the ultimate superstar and potential savior of the New England Patriots fledgling football team. He insisted Newton was THE guy even after seeing him throw several wildly inaccurate passes over the course of the season.“I saw what he was he doing” Wiggy admits. “And I can’t explain it but it felt like in my heart I believed that Cam was the guy. I felt like as long as Cam stuck around everything would be ok.”Wiggy even called out Patriots management to give Newton a new mega-contract of $35m significantly more than Brady ever received.“I saw the passes and part of me knew it…” Wiggy repeated before stopping suddenly to compose himself.“I just thank God I found a great therapist ya know? It’s so important to me to talk sports on the radio! I mean it’s my career now ya know? How’s it gonna be if I’m talking out of my ass all the time on there?”With the help of his therapist who wished to remain anonymous Wiggy realized his reality was skewed. “I’m a grown ass man now ya know and I’da never thought it still bothered me but there ya go!”It was during a session on a Friday afternoon that Wiggy first saw through his confusion. “When [the therapist] kept askin’ me what Cam meant to me – and I was just telling him ‘the guy is a great QB’ but he’d just say ‘that’s not it!’ and he’d ask me again ya know.“Til I started thinking he was gonna say it was some kind of sexual homo sapien situation going on ya know? But he says ‘NO! Keep going! Then he says to me to close my eyes and picture Cam. So I did. I saw Cam standin’ at the podium for a post-game press conference. He’s wearing a canary yellow suit and a green suede wide-brim fedora hat with a floral band and he’s just being Cam ya know! Suddenly I call out to him ‘Daddy!’ It’s crazy cuz I was just seein’ him in my head but I called to him and I called him ‘Daddy’ right?!! Then [the therapist] says “BULL’s EYE! and he explained it to me…”Wiggy believes the breakthrough will give his career a real boost. “I’m just happy I can see things a little more clearly now” he says with a new confidence “because when you talk sports on the radio you gotta be seen as someone who knows their stuff.”When contacted Cam Newton was reluctant to comment at first saying only “That shit’s flakey man…” Then after asking some questions for clarification he added “…the dude’s almost as old as my father man. What the [expletive]!”

Gervais was asked.The hard-hitting comic took two swigs out of his beer bottle and replied “The Imported Crumpet Scandal” and The Simon Cowell – Piers Morgan Scandal” to name just two.”Cooper remarked that he had heard about the counterfeit crumpets that had been shipped in from Laos but he had not heard about the Cowell-Morgan Scandal.Gervais pointed out that every Thursday night Simon and Piers meet with Queen Elizabeth II in Buckingham Palace’s The Monty Python Flying Circus Commemorative Room and play several games of Texas Hold ‘Em Poker.Brits have no problem with the widowed queen having some fun but they do not like the idea that she usually ends up losing an average of $290 (U.S.) which is equivalent to 200 British pounds.When Prime Minister Boris Johnson found out he personally phoned Cowell and Morgan and told them that they are forbidden from ever entering Buckingham Palace again.Piers said that he and Simon have Queen Elizabeth’s written permission to visit Buck House (as Gervais calls it) anytime they bloody bloomin’ want.Ricky then commented that the blonde mop-haired bloke really needs to concern himself with London’s worsening tea shortage.

I did hear some really kick ass stories and met some tight guys at the meeting but they didn’t want much to do with me. I got called a weedmidget”.Kyle said he wouldn’t have gone back if not for his mom’s insistence. “After a few meetings I decided I needed to do some heroin. It was more about being one of the guys than anything else. But once I started using it was all about getting high! I really loved it!”Asked if he had any plans to stop Kyle told us he had one more year to go “I figure if I can say I shot heroin for five years I’ll go back to the meeting…I’ll be one of the guys!”

"As soon as I saw that magnificent delicious beast struggling upriver I knew it wouldn't make it. So I set to work."Whales rarely swim into the river but when they do they often get trapped. In this case the unfortunate animal became ensnared on one of Calamari's own nets which he had placed to prevent the cetacean from becoming grounded on the river bank.Spectator Moby Richards was saddened at the spectacle. "It's a terrible end. I watched Mr Calamari put down the beast with a mustard gun and a bottle of vinegar."He added "I'm just glad to hear the animal will get a proper funeral. A cremation the vet said."Calamari's former veterinarian professor was pleased at his pupil's rescue attempts. "I taught Geoff everything he knows.

He also revealed that it is filled with quintessential vulgarity widespread drug use dozens of vagina euphemisms and political sexual innuendo.Reports are that the highly reputable Kitchen Federation of North America has issued a statement with the ICC complaining of horrendous blatant misuse of cups saucers and a butter dish.Dingledapper did not want to give too much of the remake away but he did note that the scene in the original "2 Girls 1 Cup" where a hamster sexually assaults a mature fainting goat has been changed to an elderly minnow sexually assaulting a sex-starved piranha.He also noted that the infamous Dixie cup used in the movie’s ending has been replaced with a much stronger and prettier red party cup.The movie was filmed entirely on location in Dubai India since it bears an amazingly striking resemblance to Boston.

But this is too much.” he said taking a very serious tone.Earthvessel has a call in to his GP and is also considering acupuncture treatment and/or therapy as possible remedies. His immediate goal is to free himself from the apparent obsession that he has developed for creating spoof news stories.“I’m pretty sure it stems from my disgust in the current state of affairs” he told us "and I thought it might be a good idea to find a way to laugh instead of getting angry but now I can’t stop and it’s a little scary. I’m always either writing a story or trying to come up with an idea. I haven’t even eaten all day!” When informed it was only 10:30 am he didn't respond and just kept typing what is believed to be another story.Earthvessel is asking the public at large for help with his problem. If you your family or friends have dealt with this problem in the past please contact Earthvessel at https://www.thespoof.com.

His disposition soured after watching Cam Newton play quarterback for his favorite team last season. Mark wasn’t impressed.“He was missing on passes behind the line of scrimmage! He’d have a guy open in the slot and miss him by 8 feet - I can make those throws!” Mark has played lots of football in his day. He’s also watched the very best play the game and knows what good football looks like.“I’ve played my share of football and I was pretty good” he says with a confident flair “and I watched [Tom] Brady play for 20 freakin’ years! I know this offense and I know I could step in there and do a damn good job!”Mark finally snapped during Game 15 of the season. A 38 – 9 drubbing at the hands of the Buffalo Bills. Late in the 2nd quarter of that loss with his team down 24 – 9 Mark and his people called out the beloved coach Bill Belichick from the stands with a series of expletive-laden pleas to let him play QB. The shouting went on for several minutes during his teams’ final possession of the half. Then as he tired he let out a final plea: “Come on coach just give me a chance!” before sitting down putting his face in his hands.Mark is mum on whether he’s going to training camp this year but if he’s going to get a chance it will have to be soon he wouldn’t give his age but the word is he’s a few years older than Tom Brady. But Mark doesn’t see age as a problem “I can still play…Brady will play past 60 easy!”
Tuesday 11 May 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/science-technology/152920/rumors-confirmed-hockey-fans-are-inadvertently-time-traveling,Rumors Confirmed: Hockey Fans are Inadvertently Time Traveling,Scientists from MIT have issued a statement confirming recent rumors that there are trans-dimensional portals in certain areas of the US Northeast. As many have suspected of late the scientists tell us fans who enter the Boston Garden/Fleet Center for a Boston Bruins hockey game seem to travel back in time to the 1980s.Dr. Robert Dweeber of MIT coordinated a study determining that those Bruins hockey fans enter a realm where it is always March 5th or 6th 1982. The study tracked the positions of stars in the night sky from that location to make that determination. Dr. Dweeber told us he will need more data in order “to solve this puzzle”.After attending a series of games over the past month it was noted that fans’ mode of dress hair-styles and the player jerseys worn did indeed match up with the early 80s. We also determined that it is possible to maintain a connection with the current times via smartphone.Just outside of the arena we approached several fans for comments before finding one who seemed to understand the phenomenon and was able to articulate.We waited while ardent Bruins fan Jimmy Townski shouted “GO BRUINS” several times and high fived several other fans before asking him about the time travel aspect; “Yeah what’s the big deal? I mean I thought that was supposed to be part of the experience heeeah!”Asked if he understood the experience involved traveling back to March 1982 Townski replied “well yeah I knew it was something like that. I mean sh## I didn’t know exact dates but just look around in there right?!!”The time travel phenomenon is not limited to hockey games as it has also been detected at several Dunkin’ Donuts stores around the Boston area. Additional rumors have emerged of similar occurrences in the Philadelphia area as well as parts of New Jersey.

Is Donald Trump going Bruce Jenner?Or is the Republican Party sinking like the Titanic? The leadership of the Republican Party for some ambiguous reason is Donald Trump. Also Trump believes he is still the president.Sort of like Emperor Norton.Not that again. Again? It never left.Donald Trump says Joe Biden stole the last election. That's why Trump incited the January 6 insurrection and how he got his followers to storm the Capitol.Anyone who disagrees with Trump like Liz Cheney saying “Trump lost the 2020 election!” will get thrown under the bus by Emperor Norton and his gang.You’d think that Dick Cheney would fire one across the bow at Donald Trump telling him to quit picking on his daughter Liz. Dick has fired nothing across Trump's bow.But Congressman Adam Kinzinger sent a rocket smack into Mar-a-Lago saying that Trump: "Is running for cover looking for women's clothing to wear trying to get on a Titanic lifeboat because the Republican party is sinking."Ouch!No bone-spurs-chicken Congressman Adam Kinzinger. He served five deployments in Iraq and warned House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy that supporting Trump’s false claim about the stolen election would lead to violence. Then the 6th of January happened. Sadly it is still happening.No one is listening to Congressman Kinzinger. The Republicans prefer to listen to Emperor Norton.Read more by this author:

Wednesday 12 May 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/sport/152940/nfl-networks-siciliano-is-determined-not-to-let-giant-ears-slow-him-down,NFL Network's Siciliano is determined not to let giant ears slow him down,The NFL Network just announced that afternoon anchor Andrew Siciliano is "scheduled for a surgical procedure" in June to remedy resistance problems caused by his drastically oversized ears.Siciliano recently has griped on a few occasions that the size and shape of his ears require “way too much effort" for him to move from place to place. "The resistance is ridiculous" he told us. "My walking-running speeds are extremely limited due to the size and shape of my ears. If I could fly well that might be ok but I can't!"Siciliano had been resolved to live with the issue but during the lockdown he was asked by family to wear a nylon stocking over his head – along with a mask of course to avoid contacting a virus. While wearing the stockings Siciliano was amazed at the ease of moving about with his huge ears subdued under them remarking; “Jeepers let me tell you walking seemed like a real breeze!”After having that experience Anthony has been determined to do something to remedy his problem - actually his two problems.Siciliano told us his plastic surgeon recommended reduction surgery which would leave Siciliano’s ears at approximately 32% of their current size and maintain peak audial proficiency.While this may be the more conventional option it is cost prohibitive with a six-figure price tag.The rumor mill says the NFL Network is pushing Siciliano to opt for a cheaper and more practical option of simply “punching” one or two good size holes in each ear. The network reportedly is willing to dish out the $2500 cost for the outpatient procedure that would have Siciliano back on the set the next day!Our sources tell us Siciliano is a practical guy that will likely comply with the wishes of his employer. We'll soon see if that is the case.

Longtime North Andover resident and world famous entrepreneur Pepi McFain today announced his plans to launch a porn channel for the elderly.“We’re targeting ages 65 and up which once some of these anti-aging dingies take hold our viewership is bound to swell like some of the male members out there (pun very much intended).”When asked about programing Pepi was at first reluctant to get into specifics but then reconsidered saying he ought to provide “something our people can massage their gums with for a bit”. Pepi then quickly professed his love for old folks and added “heck I’m one myself…almost!”Pepi went on to describe his programming strategy which reflects a holistic approach serving a variety of old-timer needs."We want an eclectic mix" of programming that includes erotic shows like Granny Wrestling Naked Old Yoga (NOY) Sex and Elimination Strategies and Naked Bingo. Some movies in the works include Granny and the Tranny Mabel Yells Bingo and 9 ½ Hours. And if that's not enough for you Pepi has very high hopes for two new offerings from the hot new OPRS genre (old person reality shows) titled Social Insecurity and Naked and Disoriented.The excitement is clearly building out there thanks to Pepi and his ingenuity!

Wednesday 12 May 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152937/are-you-a-rino-republican-in-name-only,Are you a RINO - Republican in Name Only?,RINO is an acronym for Republican in name only. Prior to 2016 this derogatory term was primarily applied to those who ran for election as Republicans but once elected voted as Democrats. The term also included voters who were registered Republicans but thought like Democrats. An individual for example who was opposed to free trade and supported unfettered spending might properly have been defined as a RINO. Over time however definitions change and the term RINO is now applied to those such as Liz Cheney who was once considered a rock solid Republican leader.I have even heard that some Republicans worry about whether they are real Republicans or just RINOs. Fortunately there is a six question quiz (taken from the questions that the Republican National Committee uses to vet potential Republican candidates) that enables any Republican to tell whether they are a RINO.1)	Who really won the 2020 election: (a) Donald J. Trump. (b) Joe Biden (c) Kanye West (d) Someone else.2)	Who/what is best able to interpret the Constitution and make it relevant to 21st century challenges: (a) Donald J. Trump (b) The Supreme Court (c) Congress (d) The Justice Department.3)	Is there any policy supported by or action taken by Donald J Trump that you disagree with: (a) no (b) yes (c) Not sure.4) Four Presidents—Washington Jefferson Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt— are sculpted in Mt. Rushmore. No president elected in the last century has been added. If we were to add one president whom would you recommend: (a) Donald J Trump (b) Franklin Roosevelt (c) Harry Truman (d) Ronald Reagan or (e) Some other president.5)	Which of our nation’s forty-six presidents do you think had the highest IQ: (a) Donald J Trump (b) Abraham Lincoln (c) Thomas Jefferson (d) Woodrow Wilson.6)	Which of our nation’s forty-six presidents did/does the opposite sex find most irresistable: (a) Donald J Trump (b) Warren Harding (c) John Kennedy (d) William Jefferson Clinton (e) Some other president.If you a Republican and answered a to each of the questions you can relax. You are not a RINO. If you answered something other than a to just one question you are in danger of becoming a RINO and might wish to reconsider your answer to that question. If you answered something other than a to two or more questions you are a RINO at least in the sense in which the term is used in 2021.

He went on outlined a strategy he’d use if Putin "started something".Trump told his boys he’d first try and reason with “Vlad” and cite their common interests and attempt to smooth things over. If that fails Trump said he'd fake a left hook then throw a straight right to Putin’s nose in an effort to stun the Russian strongman. "I think he'd be a sitting duck for the straight right in that situation and I'd put all my weight behind it." Trump excitedly told his sons.Eric then asked “what do you think would happen after that dad? Do you think he'd be finished?” To which Trump responded "I think so but if not since he’s usually wearing a sports coat or a big sweater I’d probably pull it over his head and pummel him. With a guy like that you wanna get the KO fast and not have to worry about him getting back at me”.Eric added that his father "would not really want to fight Putin" if he clan avoid it. "He wouldn't want to hurt him he has lots of respect for him and thinks he’s a cool guy! We all do!"

And she then expressed that it will hurt like a motherf*cker (her word) to have it removed.When told of Sharleen Box’s situation a Laker’s vice-president simply said “Tough titty said the kitty.”Meanwhile the entire Laker’s cheerleading squad has hired the services of famed human rights attorney Gloria Allred who is charging the cheerleaders a fee of $1.
Wednesday 12 May 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/sport/152933/swampscott-man-still-trying-to-catch-first-fish-after-65-years,Swampscott man still trying to catch first fish after 65 years,Mr. Dave Singer considers himself part of a long line of sea going people from Massachusetts’ North Shore. With his old boss he co-owns a beautiful 30 ft sailboat and loves nothing more than being on the water. Sailing and fishing are two of Mr. Singer’s favorite pastimes and you’re likely to see Dave down on the docks wearing his Henry Fonda On Golden Pond Indo surf hat moseying around and gabbing with the boys.When it comes to fishing he knows all the lingo and has a tackle-box complete with all the gear and all the extras you can imagine. With other fishermen he loves to gab about methods tricks and reading favorable or unfavorable conditions on the surf but when they get to stories of their conquests Dave tends to change the subject or otherwise offer his apologies and leave.That’s because Dave has yet to catch a single fish even after an entire lifetime of casting those lines. It’s going on 65 years now in fact. Dave says he has no idea how he’s managed to go this long with no success but he’s philosophical about it. “I don’t see anyone keeping score” he says. “It’s not like I’m doing it for a living and suffering those consequences. If I want a fish sandwich I’ll dish out the ten bucks.”A lesson for us all Dave amazingly maintains a positive can-do attitude! “I have to believe I get a little better at it every day! I don’t let it bother me anymore like it used to at one time.He’s referring to the days before he came to terms with his poor luck and decided to make an all-out assault on the fish. I was out there night and day for a few years.”Asked if he thinks he has set a world record Mr. Singer quickly changes the subject. "Looks like a storm on the horizon."But Dave doesn’t consider all that time lost. In his mind he’s made the most of it. “I’ve taught others to fish and they do just fine. I once stood beside a six year-old girl who used a kid’s toy fishing line and wouldn’t you know she dropped the line and not five seconds later she was pulling out a little flounder! I was standing right there beside her when it happened!” Dave repeated.Let’s all wish Dave the best of luck in 2021. If there’s any justice to be had we believe Dave will finally catch himself a fish this coming summer!

Nurse Sharon Hostecker explained “I started asking him ‘what’s wrong’ but Billy just laughed at me saying ‘don’t you see what he’s doing?’ So I really thought he wanted to put on a show for us! He’s a really nice guy and all – I knew that from earlier.”From his flat in Peckham Mr. Evans told us “sure I know Mick! My folks [have] been telling me all about him since I was a wee lad and I’ve seen vids too. Seemed to me he was performing and doing a right good job of it for a bloke in the ICU.”The “concert” lasted approximately 12 minutes from what we gather until Mick finally passed out. Nurse Hostecker explained: “He paused for a moment then started up again and I yelled out ‘Oh it’s Louie Louie!’ but Jason said ‘no way that’s something else!’ well come to find out that’s not even one of his songs! That’s when I suspected something was amiss. But oh Louie Louie! I've always loved that song and I always thought that was The Rolling Stones but there ya go missy. I was wrong all that time! ”Hostecker tells us the audience of approximately 12 people quickly dispersed while Billy and Jason played on for a few minutes before realizing that Jagger had left ‘the show’ so to speak. He’s reportedly in stable condition this morning.Patients in adjacent rooms hooted in delight while calling for orderlies to wheel them into better positions to see the show.Later on staff members reported a strong smell of sulfur on the unit as a couple of patients had held lighted matches calling for an encore. Evans claimed that Mr. Stark had also lit “a match or two” after the crowd had dispersed but when asked about this Stark claimed he was simply trying to cover up for Evans who Stark claims was constantly passing gas the entire evening.Jagger’s attorney would not speak on the record but did tell us he was looking into the possible activation of a performance agreement to be executed with hospital administration.Mr. Jagger regained consciousness late this morning but refused to comment on this situation. His doctor expects that he’ll be out of the ICE later this afternoon. No word on additional performances but stay tuned! One member of hospital staff told us he thinks Mick's buddy Keith "could get wheeled in at any moment for all we know."

Presently with the Southern District of New York looking into Trump’s investments and tax returns jail time appears to be in Trump’s future.Then there’s the state of Georgia. Georgia is also looking into Trump’s actions and phone calls during the last election. Trump encouraged the Secretary of State to "locate" about thirty thousand more votes to put him over the top and allow him to "win" the state.Finally there’s the FBI investigation and Trump's connection into the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol. Also what were Trump’s ties to Russia and Vladimir Putin? Why the transcripts of their conversations destroyed?Reversing the lyrics: Nothing is coming up roses.Silently without voicing an opinion one way or the other Republicans hope Trump goes to the slammer. And on one Kaepernick knee: Please Lord before the next election.The minority leader of the House Kevin McCarthy booted Liz Cheney out of her leadership position in the Republican Party for saying: Donald Trump did not win his last election.However later that same day when asked whether Joe Biden was the legally elected President of the United States Kevin McCarthy replied “Yes. We aren’t going to talk about that anymore.”Maybe Donald Trump might have something to talk about and talk about that.Read more by this author:

This year he came back acting like a grumpy old man!"Davis went on to make a stark comparison. "Tommy typically reminds me of these yellow corduroy pants with penguins all of them I used to wear. Now he's more like this pair of khakis I had in seventh grade. They were too uptight uncomfortable and really just embarrassing."The Chesterfield brothers Lord Tim and his bother Dave were also surprised how thoroughly Tommy had embraced the bad example set by the pouty-puss Packers Quarterback."I know Rodgers is just looking for an excuse to get out of the same division as Tom Brady to avoid direct comparisons "Lord Chesterfield explained condescendingly while making some inexplicably wide eyed expression "but I can't quite figure out why Tommy would behave in a similar manner."Dave Chesterfield offered a more blunt explanation for Cheater Tommy's behavior "He's really just mad that playing for the Broncos will expose Rodgers for the fraud he is."Harry Dunne manager of team Mutt Cutts had a different theory for Tommy's bad attitude "He seems to be upset that we agreed to expand the league to allow a couple new members including someone with no previous fantasy football experience. I don't thinks that's a big deal since I was in that same position a few years ago and still won a championship more recently than Tommy has."Shelly of team Too Darn Loud said "Sure I'd rather we made sure every new manager was at least as good as Team Sandmanz but as long as it doesn't make the draft last any longer I'm pretty much fine with anything."Other members of the league were a little less sure what was going on."I only remember something about nuts in a heating vent puking out the window of a car and something about an ICP concert" Cat Kennedy offered."I just wanted to have some beers" Rick McRickerson added.We did reach out to Tommy to respond to his league mate's observations."I'm just protecting the integrity of the league!" Tommy stated. "The Your Mom Fantasy Football League is a serious and distinguished sports institution and I will not see it diluted by inferior talent! We have to keep the standard the standard and I refuse to play against anyone who isn't great like me."The long and storied history of the YMFFL seems to suggest that not all managers in the YMFFL have started out as fantasy football experts as Tommy indicates. After all J.B. did draft his back up tight end immediately after his starting tight end in the fifth and sixth rounds and it didn't seem to ruin the experience of competing in the league that year..."We all play games to have fun" Davis Campbell explained "but sometimes people seem to lose sight of that. Maybe both Aaron Rodgers and Tommy Bentrolla should take that under consideration."
Thursday 13 May 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/entertainment-gossip/152946/the-jimmy-kimmel-sean-hannity-feud-has-turned-very-nasty,The Jimmy Kimmel – Sean Hannity Feud Has Turned Very Nasty,HOLLYWOOD – (Satire News) – The first Kimmel-Hannity feud ended two years ago but Fox News second banana Sean Hannity has rekindled it by saying that Jimmy Kimmel was actually born in Afghanistan.Kimmel fired back by saying that Sean is so damn goofy looking that he makes Disney’s Goofy look like George Clooney. He then noted that he heard that Fox boy accidentally brushed his teeth with Preparation H and his tongue shrunk down to the size of a nickel.Hannity then pointed out that the only reason why Kimmel hates the twice-impeached one-term fake president is because Trump spent more time playing golf than he did running the country; he then added that Jimmy is also extremely jealous because DJT has a beautiful orange jack-o-lantern complexion.The talk show host then noted that lying Don’s son dopey Don Jr. talks over 200 words a minute and he looks like he combs his hair with an egg beater.Sean then remarked that Jimmy’s eyebrows are both fake like his Italian accent.Kimmel then revealed that Melania had texted him and confided to him that Sean and her husband are secretly in love.She then confessed that she knows for a fact that the Fox host actually got her husband’s facial likeness tattooed on his scrotum.Meanwhile Jimmy Kimmel has stated that Melania has agreed to do a one-hour no-holds-barred interview with him and she is even going to show him a never-before-seen photo of Donaldo’s itty bitty orange pee-pee.
Thursday 13 May 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/entertainment-gossip/152947/sir-topham-hatt-sought-by-london-police-for-deviant-porn-distribution,Sir Topham Hatt sought by London police for deviant porn distribution,Sir Topham Hatt from the beloved children's show 'Thomas the Tank Engine' is reportedly on the run from the law this morning after it was learned he's at the center of a vast 20+ year "deviant pornography" ring.Sir Hatt was questioned last year when he was suspected of possession of illicit material. That investigation was set off after Hatt mistakenly sent a solicitation email to a Sodor woman identified only as Mrs Kyndley. Hatt denied any knowledge of the email at that time and claimed that his account must have been hacked.Authorities theorized that Hatt had meant the email for another recipient found in his contacts a Mrs. Kyddie who investigators believe is another high-ranking member of the ring.Sir Topham Hatt is affectionately known by his associates and co-workers as "The Fat Controller". A spokesperson for his employer The North Western Railway expressed shock and sadness at the latest developments but declined to get into further details regarding Hatt's record as an employee at the railway.We did however speak with anonymous sources from the railway who told us of one incident in June 2017 when there was a rather ugly encounter involving Hatt and a senior member of the engine team known as Diesel-10 who claimed that Hatt made unwanted advances and had touched him inappropriately. All charges were dropped however after Hatt's attorneys argued successfully that "Diesel-10 is just a diesel engine with human aspirations.After the court's decision Diesel-10 fell apart - literally and has not been in one piece seen since. The show's reclusive star Thomas did not seem disappointed at these developments and was heard remarking in reference to Diesel-10 "good riddance to bad rubbish!" It seems to be common among Sodorites and those close to the show that Thomas and Diesel-10 are not the best of friends.Another incident from an anonymous source involved Hatt and his former assistant and "right-hand man" Mr Arkwright. Arkwright claimed his boss (Hatt) had abused him physically and said Hatt made a habit of knocking him over and sitting on top of him during tea time in a rather perverse ritual.The Island of Sodor is abuzz over the latest events. Mr. Percival aka The Thin Controller told us he is "not at all surprised" and believes Hatt is "guilty of all charges and more".We're told that both The Vicar and The Fat Clergyman are also being sought for questioning.A woman who identified herself as Dowager Hatt stood outside the Hatt home as we arrived and through her tears told us but was unable to speak with us. It is speculated the woman is the mother of Hatt but that has not been confirmed.Law enforcement authorities told us they are waiting for the end of the school day when Kiddie Police will be available to verify more of the specificsAuthorities are currently searching Hatt's residence as well as the railway engine barns for evidence. Mrs. Hatt who did not want to speak with us was last seen riding off on Gordon another rather spiffy and reportedly "quite cheeky" tank engine.Police are asking the public to be on the lookout for Hatt. "At this point he could be anywhere" Danny the Desk Sergeant told us just before they rolled the closing credits.

Thursday 13 May 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/uk/152939/pm-hails-opening-of-britains-free-ports-to-international-trade,PM hails opening of Britain's free ports to international "trade",Boris Johnson has hailed free ports as the solution to the problems that weren't caused by Brexit at all. The first one opens this week in Scunthorpe. Britain hasn't had a free port since 2012 and the port is already controversial for the businesses it has attracted.Geoff Jewellery is a pimp who is planning to open an international whorehouse in the once-abandoned dockyard area. "It's great" he said fingering the gold chains around his neck. "We can bring in cheap Russian quim and sailors from around the world will be able to visit them without paying any tax. That's the real killer for any pimping business - having to fill in the tax returns."Locals have mixed opinions about the possibility of the world's largest brothel opening in their neighbourhood. "I'd like to visit it" said married man Albert Trousers "But because it's effectively in international territory I'd have to pay the tariffs on the condoms I'd be exporting. Not to mention the hassle of travelling across an international customs border. Also the wife wouldn't like it."Working girl Sally Spread was angry. "I'm going to have to lower my prices to compete" she moaned. "Thruppenny a shag with Ukrainian crumpet is too cheap. At least they're on the other side of this new border they're having to create otherwise I'd go and start a catfight."Business owner Eugene Gristle was optimistic. "I run a dry-cleaning service but I can't decide whether to move it into the free port or not. If I move it then all my customers will be sailors or if I stay in town then I'll only be able to service the locals. Really it would be much easier if the two separate groups could somehow come together in an international single market and/or customs union."
Thursday 13 May 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152942/ghost-of-james-buchanan-makes-annual-appearance,Ghost of James Buchanan makes annual appearance,Once a year a chill falls upon the White House as the specter of long dead president James Buchanan appears and offers advice to the current sitting president and is then promptly ignored.The first report of this phenomenon was when the ghostly apparition was seen speaking to James Garfield and telling him bodyguards are “for suckers” according to witnesses. The next week Garfield was promptly assassinated beginning the nation wide tradition of ignoring the ghosts always ill thought out advice.Other reports of the spirit appearing are well known among White House Staff and personnel. The spirit famously told FDR that the New Deal was a “fools errand” and would result in his landslide loss. He also referred to FDR as “one term Franklin” even well into the former president’s 3rd term.During his appearance to Ronald Reagan he sagely advised not to travel to Berlin and that only a “dunce” would give a speech at the Berlin Wall. The general rule of thumb passed down to each president’s successor is to not only ignore the spirit but “probably do whatever the opposite is of what it tells you.”Since the Clinton administration nobody will even acknowledge when he appears. The last known message heard as the ghost ripped its way into our material realm was from 2000 when it was heard screaming in a chilling voice to “tell the patriots to trade Tom Brady.”

Originally the loan was to have been for $50 billion but the sharp-talking vice-president convinced the two men to ante up an extra $15 billion each.The vice-president wanted to make it clear that the $80 billion loan was agreed to at an interest rate of zero percent (0).Meanwhile the rumor that started in Iceland that Bezos and Musk will both have their likeness on a brand new United States $1000 bill have not been confirmed as of press time.

Special to The Spoof.

Friday 14 May 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/uk/152953/beatle-fans-cancel-ceremony-to-forgive-yoko-ono-as-melee-ensues,Beatle fans cancel ceremony to forgive Yoko Ono as melee ensues...,Yoko has been a target for the ire of Beatles fans since 1969 or approximately 52 years now. Recently in the spirit of Love that her husband John Lennon preached three major Beatles fan clubs joined together and planned a Yoko Is Forgiven Ceremony to be held in Strawberry Fields section of New York City’s Central Park for June 1 2021.At a planning meeting last night representatives of each of the three fan clubs met to plan the event. On the agenda was an exercise of reviewing a rather long list of grievances against Yoko. As meeting attendees worked their way through the list they began having second thoughts about the ceremony itself. Before long building security was on the scene because of the noise being made by the now agitated meeting attendees. Soon after the police were called in as it was feared a Get Yoko lynch mob was forming.According to reports several members opposing the event were in attendance and were quite vocal in rehashing some of Yoko’s actions back in the late 60’s. Apparently It wasn't long before the old resentments were revived for everyone. What began as mild discontent among attendees soon turned to anger then rage and the meeting came to an ugly conclusion.After being reached for comment Beatle Paul McCartney told us “It’s rather unfortunate I’ve even forgiven Yoko for getting me busted for pot on the 1979 Japan Tour. I don’t see why our fans need to hold those resentments 50 years later. After all she’s just a frail old woman now eh.”Simon Howard of the British Beatles Fan Club disagrees however “I had reservations all along. She’s right evil is what she is. I don’t enjoy it but I’m not going to suddenly say it’s all right what she did am I?”As we tried to depart Mr Howard ran after us and added "You do know she deliberately dismantled the group? She was all about Yoko and nothing else! She gave not a thought to the millions of us who grew up with the Beatles she just thought her inane so-called art projects were the thing..." After we made several attempts to disengage Mr. Howard began directing his anger toward us even after we explained that we had what we needed.Yoko herself was not available for comment. There's no word on whether the ceremony might be a future possibility.

That lie had a lifespan of many years. However the Obama-Kenya lie is presently in the footnotes of history.Trump the perpetrator of that lie lives on.His second and latest super-duper big lie is that he did not lose the election! Joe Biden stole it. Trump had Liz Cheney removed from her Republican position in the House because she disagreed with the Trump election lie.Trump convinced his not too bright or clean followers Biden stole the election. They should fight for their country. Storm the Capitol and prevent the election from being certified.He even promised to lead the march down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol but chickened out. Instead he watched it with glee on television from the safety of the White House. It could be a footnote to the second big lie as his lies begat lies.In the midst of those lies there is the lie about releasing his tax returns. There was the claim they were being audited. But at this point who is counting the Trump lies?Attorney-General Garland maybe?Somewhere in the scrambled egg history of Trump lies is the Bone Spur lie. While that lie might be yesterday some of his followers who stormed the Capitol on January 6th were veterans. Do Trump’s followers who stormed the Capitol remember the Bone Spur lie?Or do they think it’s okay to chuck your duty and patriotism and instead save your country by watching television?Will Trump pay their attorney fees?He promised!Hmmm?Read more by this author:

After a brief panic things settled down and to the relief of all on the scene the creature behaved quite civilly.It was learned his name is Pti from the planet Bogl 23 light years from Earth. Allegedly Og had mistaken Chicago as the US capital.Experts soon recognized that Pti was a somewhat intelligent creature with a message for us but he has no vocal cords. They initially offered him paper & pencil but there was a problem there too. Og's body is constantly exuding several types of fluids reflecting his thoughts and emotions or so we're told. By the time he'd write his message the paper would be destroyed and the written message illegible.Eventually officials secured a waterproof tablet which turned out to be the perfect solution. However Pti's message caused some alarm. Apologetically Pti told officials that Boglians have been watching us for over 200 years and have developed a healthy disdain for humanity.Pti reports they are quite close to having the ability to travel en mass to our planet and they're promising earthlings a thorough ass-kicking when they get here.When asked why Pt told officials there broad consensus on his planet is that humans are repulsive selfish creatures. He added that if you consider what humans think of rats you'll have a good idea of what these aliens think of humans.There is also good news however. These aliens do believe we are redeemable and so plan on launching a sincere effort to change human behavior. The only catch is that their plan begins with a serious beating for every one of us.Pti had been provided with living quarters at a luxury hotel but the inadvertent damages caused by excessive fluids were more than the hotel was willing to deal with. Plans are in the works to place a tent somewhere on the outskirts of the city.

Kebab shop owner Geoff Doneropoulos was ecstatic. "It's nice to have a proper elephant's trunk" he said.As part of the terms of the deal Nambia will receive a truckload of old Elton John CDs for their own domestic market. The ageing singer is renowned in the country where he is the British equivalent of Uncle Ben. As "Blind Daddy Couscous" his bespectacled face is used to sell everything from Pot Noodle to pork pies.Economists were excited by the news. Geoff Count said "If you pay me an extra thousand in unmarked notes I'll say it's the best trade deal in history."
Saturday 15 May 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/152959/exclusive-pope-francis-talks-to-the-beatles-channel,Exclusive: Pope Francis Talks to the Beatles Channel,The beloved down-to-earth everyman leader of Catholicism Pope Francis sat down this past week with Dennis Elsas and Bill Flanagan on their weekly show. The Fab Forum is a fan favorite broadcast on the Beatles Channel.Yours truly was also there and although they forbid me asking questions — or any speaking whatsoever for that matter I was able to capture a fascinating exchange. The pope’s words were translated by the now aging hipster priest Father Guido Sarducci of Saturday Night Live fame who said he was honored to come out of retirement to help out. Enjoy!The Beatles Channel: Good morning to you Your Holiness I can’t tell you what an honor it is to have you on our show!Pope Francis: Thank you very much boys.BC: Your Holiness you’re widely known as The People’s Pope. We were wondering how much your love of the Beatles had to do with that?PF: I’m not sure I understand what you’re asking me.BC: Ha ha ok maybe I’m jumping the gun here just a bit Holy Father. Let me start by asking you if you like the Beatles and maybe you can tell us how much you like them if you can?PF: Oh yes I was and still am a big fan! I was in my 20’s when they became popular and they were how you say on fire in Buenos Aires and in Chile where I studied and worked. I remember I was teaching high school at the time and all the children as well as many of my fellow teachers were big fans.BC: Ahh interesting so you taught music and used some Beatles music in your classes?PF: No I taught literature and psychology not music.BC: Oh I see pardon me. So let me ask you Holy Father how much did you like the Beatles?PF: I liked them very much. Like I’ve told you they seemed to be everywhere during that time. It was a real craze.BC: So would you say then Your Holiness that you were a bigger fan than most?PF: How can I know that? I told you I liked them very much…BC: All righty then let’s try a different track. We were given a chart of some very interesting facts about you and your life.Um...let’s see here….you studied philosophy and are a trained chemist. That’s interesting! Oooh you used to be a bouncer — that’s amazing! You owned a Harley wow! Sounds like you were a real tough guy Your Holiness! But is see you DO have a softer side too you also like taking selfies you tango and you once had a girlfriend who was possibly the love of your life. Incredible! Let me ask you about her. Was she a big Beatles fan?PF: I don’t really know. When she was in my life it was quite a few years before the Beatles were popular.BC: Uh huh ok I see. It also says here that you recently invited several homeless men to one of your birthday parties which is an amazing beautiful tribute of kindness and compassion Your Holiness. Let me ask you because both of us here at the Beatles Channel would love to know were many of those homeless men Beatles fans? And might you have played some Beatles numbers at your birthday party?PF: I’d say that some of them must have liked the Beatles yes. As for the music I’m sure we played some Beatles songs at the party but I’m sorry I can’t remember it was almost five years ago in 2016.BC: Ok fine….maybe they played the “Birthday song”? Or “It’s Johnny’s Birthday”?PF: Yes it’s surely possible.BC: Fascinating! Well it’s been a real honor for us Your Holiness! I want to wish you all the best especially in your work on behalf of the downtrodden as well as the message of love that you carry everywhere which we can say is also the message of the Beatles…ooh and I just remembered we meant to ask you about Jesus too! A few items like the Lennon-Jesus controversy…you know the “we’re more popular than Jesus” thing also we wanted to ask you in general terms about the Jesus-Beatles connection. Not to mention your thoughts on the Netflix “Two Popes” movie which in fact also has a little-known Beatles connection. You’ll have to promise us you’ll come back for another visit with us Your Holiness.PF: I will do my best. Bless you boys. I wish you the best from the bottom of my heart*.*Fab Forum hosts told me that final sentiment was from Father Guido Sarducci.Note to fans: There was no word on when the next papal visit to the Beatles Channel may come about but we will keep you posted.

It all started he tells us when he was researching obscure drugs on the internet. “I came across a story about some of the substances those horses get. One thing led to another and next thing you know I was a racing fan!”Coleman as it turns out is not a very frequent runner himself and only developed an interest in entering this race after seeing the “horse-only” field.In this case Coleman is no passive observer or couch potato. “I guess sometimes you have a new perspective when you’re new to something and when I watched a couple of races on YouTube and thought about the drugs those horses get I got to wondering why are the races only for horses? What about humans or other animals? That might make things much more interesting!”Rather than sitting around pondering the issue or cursing his luck Coleman went straight to the authorities asking for an entry form. They told me it was too late which is fine but what got my goat was their attitude. They treated me like I was some kind of idiot. They’re the idiots if you ask me!!!Coleman promises he'll be on the racing scene next year. He has a friend who is a lawyer who he hopes can help him. "Look for my name in next year's Kentucky Derby!"

Sunday 16 May 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/world/152969/anti-masking-protest-ends-badly-36-vehicles-damaged,Anti-Masking Protest ends badly: 36 vehicles damaged,Tragedy struck today at an anti-mask protest in downtown Springfield MA. Over 600 people attended the rally at City Hall Plaza on a beautiful Saturday afternoon.Protesters were whipped into a frenzy by a rousing speech delivered by activist leader Jasper Brown. In his speech Brown railed against the “tyranny of the CDC” and finished off in a highly animated state saying that if fellow protesters wished to understand their compliant mask-wearing counterparts they should wear their masks over their eyes.It’s not clear if Brown meant the idea literally but the majority of the crowd did while shouting insults ridiculing “the stupidity of the passive compliance” that they depict as a practice of mask -wearers.An ominous sign of things to come emerged at that point as protesters milled around blindly colliding with trees and each other. A few conflicts ensued but only one physical confrontation.The real trouble came when protesters got in their cars to leave. At last count 36 vehicles were damaged in collisions.Police sought and questioned Brown but did not charge him. The activist told us things didn’t work out as he intended. “I never thought people would drive that way! I guess I didn’t think it through. You see I always use a bandana as a mask that is semi-transparent.”
Sunday 16 May 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/world/152967/expert-says-yes-to-pronouns-for-psychotics-and-more,Expert says "YES!" to pronouns for psychotics and more!,One of the foremost mental health experts in the US has issued a statement supporting the application and use of pronouns for people with psychotic disorders.Dr. Felix Hoenikker explains “these people are having what you and I might call hallucinations or delusions but whatever it might be it’s just as real to them as what we call everyday reality. In fact they might say that you or I are somehow detached from what is real you see?”.The doc has become world-famous in his crusades for the mentally ill. His primary message is that the people we classify as ‘mentally sound’ do not have sole rights to the reality market.In his statement Dr. Hoenikker went on to provide clear detailed instructions on the correct behavior protocol when one is in the presence of a psychotic individual. “First of all we don’t say ‘they suffer from this or that. The word “suffers” doesn’t belong here as it stigmatizes the individual. We also must get rid of the notion that these folks have ‘lost touch with reality’. It’s quite arrogant when you stop and think about it for one person to tell another what exactly reality is. One person’s reality is just as valid and another’s.His advice when engaging with such folks is to “listen carefully to them and ask questions so you might obtain some understanding of where they are and what they see. Then you simply do as much as you can to validate their reality! For example they might believe they’re another gender than what they appear or they may see themselves as an inanimate object. Your job if you are indeed a good and compassionate person is to be at the ready with the correct language to validate their reality. Why should we do this only for the gender-crossing set and not for other people?”.When we reached out to the doctor for comment he added “It’s quite selfish when you stop and think about it to assume your view of reality is more real than someone else’s. For example right now you might think of yourself as an living three-dimensional person but in my reality you’re just a voice! A sound coming through my cell phone you see? That’s what you are to me.”Dr. Hoenikker promises he’ll soon be publishing extensive detail in his new book to be titled: He She It Be.
Sunday 16 May 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152966/first-gay-dunkin--donuts-opens-in-cincinnati,First gay Dunkin’ Donuts opens in Cincinnati!,One of America’s most popular coffee chains has burst into the modern age with the first sexual preference-specific LGBTQ-themed Dunkin’ Donuts store in downtown Cincinnati. Lots of fanfare and glitz on display for passersby at the grand opening yesterday as hundreds of happy rainbow-adorned people – mostly men danced hugged and hung about all around the new store.“I can’t even tell you right now how happy I am!” said one customer who identified himself as The Snake Charmer. And I’m so relieved I don’t have to dress up as a normie just to fit in at Dunkin’s to get my morning coffee.”The Snake Charmer went on to tell us about how many years back after coming out he’d tried to switch to Starbucks where most of his friends were going but “I just never took to their coffee. Too heavy and dark for me.”When pressed on what causes his discomfort in the conventional Dunkin’ stores Mr. Charmer paused for several seconds thinking then tapped his forehead several times before emitting a series of high-pitched squeals then laughing hysterically. A few minutes later after composing himself he told us he rarely has trouble talking but that this was an emotional topic for him. Finally he said “Well for one thing it’s where both my parents and all my family go…and everyone I see standing in line there reminds me of them or their friends. Then there’s another type of customer that kind of looks like they live in a cave rigged with e-games…and then there’s part of the goth crowd of course but never any of my kind you know what I mean?”Snake Charmer is not alone in his difficulty describing the issue. Gay community activists have launched multiple attacks on Dunkin’s over the years in attempts to trigger a culture change but the brand “just keeps soaring like a rocket into the wild blue” as another rather excitable man dressed as a rainbow told us.Another customer approached us and said “I’ve been going to Dunkin’s for almost 40 years and the customers look exactly the same now as they did in the 80s.” This one asked to be called Java Bear. Mr. Bear wore only a thong Dr Scholl’s sandals and Dunkin’s rainbow-themed He-His top hat. His name is fitting as Java Bear stands well over 6” and sported a fur-covered chest that you have to see to believe.Later that morning there appeared a “rainbow caravan” with over a dozen vehicles including a couple of rainbow-covered vans with giant phallus’ fixed to their roofs. One van lead the caravan and the second one brought up the rear. The vehicles circled the store three times to the delight of the cheering crowds before stopping in the parking lot.We were told the group had started out with one van out of Key West FL and another out of Provincetown MA. Apparently each of them picked up a few cars along the way until the two groups were united in Winston-Salem North Carolina where they did say they were harrased by “some stupid bigots” then headed for Cincinnati in a celebratory procession that included much horn honking and flag waving.“It was one of the most exciting fulfilling things I’ve ever done!” participant Dennis Spears breathlessly told us. Dennis told us he rode ‘shotgun’ in the lead van. “Honestly you start out alone and do one rest stop rendezvous after another – next thing you know it’s a party on wheels!”We jokingly asked him if he’d make the 900-mile commute to the new store for his morning coffee Dennis hesitated “What’s that now? I’m not following…” After his friend reminded of the grand opening he said “oh yeah that’s right! Sure I would! Ha ha ha….”The store honored the event by giving out free crullers to the first 300 customers and their pastry selection included crullers French twists muffins and rainbow donuts.Dunkin Brands issued a press release stating they are proud to now have a store that salutes alternative lifestyles.

(Here George's U Tube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCfByG5SCIs)The female owner of the house was lying in her hot bath at the time singing "When I'm blowing Bubbles!" a renowned East London refrain usually sung by followers of a footy club in the area and the lesbian fraternity who follow their female team.She clocked the window cleaner rubbing his chamois leather and screamed "Hey you f'ing pervert go and rub your chamois leather somewhere else I'm waiting for my lover to scrub my back!"The window cleaner fell backwards off his ladder still humming his favourite tune! He landed in a prickly rose bush and swore never to do his rub-a-dub show again in front of lesbian back-scrubbers.As for the owner of the house she threw £1.50P out of the window and told him to 'F off' and never come back again. She is now searching for a female window cleaner who enjoys a hot-bubbly-scrubbing too!
Sunday 16 May 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/152960/the-incredible-whiteness-of-being,The incredible whiteness of being,In 2020 amongst all the COVID hysteria the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement was a big media trend as well as those that used to take the knee before sporting contests started but wouldn't you have been more BLM devoted if you went on both knees?What if someone was being whipped and beaten while singing the national anthem?What if the multi-millionaire sportsmen went to go live in predominantly lower income neighbourhoods for a week before the big game?What if someone went on all fours? Would they be 75% more BLM than being on one knee? Now that the fad for BLM has died down and people aren’t focusing on taking the knee before proceedings does that mean that BLM doesn’t matter any more? What about if someone has parents of mixed race? Should they have been considered only partly oppressed and as such only received an equal percentage of our sympathy according to their black genealogy? What if someone grew up wealthy their parents are black their grandparents are black and their grandparents. However as they get older and more wealthy they become more embittered with life and end up beating their domestic servants?Would they still be able to qualify their sympathy for BLM? What if their servants were white when they were giving them the beatdown? What about Idi Amin and Robert Mugabe? Would they have qualified to stand for the whatever the BLM movement is supposed to mean if they had taken the knee before events?And what if we consider “(insert your cause) history month” these groups have absolutely forgotten how to communicate the concerns of the individuals and parties concerned and have just blended activist slogans for their own devices or to slingshot their own social media profile. History is a wide ranging subject but when you choose to cut it up into little pieces so that you can focus on isolated issues and use it to promote your own agenda you only further entrench differences and help to divide society along social lines.We cannot undo the misdeeds of the past by just over emphasising that the grandchildren of today have to make reparations for the grandparents of yesteryear. We should be promoting an agenda of equality social understanding and inclusiveness supported by education. So until we stop promoting; “The movement for black lesbian cats stuck in a blind dogs body awareness month” can you really expect anyone to take a social movement seriously long term by isolating social groups? What do you hope to achieve by acting differently to another ethnicity for a week because your great grandparents may have had a different view point on society to yourself?Or you have only just realised that releasing YouTube videos of yourself wiping your nose and tears of sadness away with some money you have lying about in your house whilst giving a cup of coffee to a homeless individual is narcissistic but you continue anyway because you like the feeling narcissism gives you and the positive reinforcement social media comments give you.Nothing actually changes no-one actually conducts themselves differently towards another. There are just more meetings espousing the need for change more adverts from your local friendly corporation telling you how much they care (as long as you spend your money with them). This is the sort of activism that fudges the lines between right and wrong good and bad constructive and destructive and ends up hijacking the efforts of legitimate activists and their conduct.Imagine if we had an event everyday to highlight a tragedy an injustice done to another group they would all just melt into one without any real focus on anything nothing becomes of the genuine needs for change in society. So whose fault is the whole BLM hysteria in 2020?It is all of our faults because all of us just allow mainstream media to add fuel to the bonfire of racism injustices and pent up anger too many of us just go on as before turning a blind eye to whatever gets in our way. Pushing aside whatever doesn’t fit into our own little boxes but as soon as something concerns ourselves we demand change we picket politicians and then still vote for the same blue or red the same old man or the other same old man. We want change for the better just as long as that change means I am still better than my neighbour. We don’t mind helping Africa as long we can still pillage their resources (obviously in an eco-friendly manner) and they will still accept a few second hand clothes for their troubles whilst standing next to a pallet of food aid sacks for the photo-op to be placed in 1st world magazine charity appeal initiative.As societies and nation-states we have never been more connected more easily able to communicate across boundaries. However we have also never been more divided locally more tribalistic and partisan along political ideologies. We have allowed our own identities and desire to be understood to steer us into little boxes of separate religions races and now multiple gender pronouns. Our leaders so often are corrupt or are too bothered by what their financial backers agendas are so they lead us on diverging paths away from bipartisan co-operation and mutual understanding and into openly hostile disregard.So often we rely on the rumour being passed round our social platforms just so that we can have the approving nod of acceptance and faux friendship from another drunk “anonymous_poster123” or fellow employee which can eventually lead to more social harm than good. “...Just go with the flow Dude!” as Disney insidiously tells us in “Finding Nemo”. Instead we should be doing and believing as Mohandas Gandhi states: “Many people especially ignorant people want to punish you for speaking the truth for being correct for being you. Never apologize for being correct or for being years ahead of your time. If you’re right and you know it speak your mind.” And this very principal of Gandhi’s you can see bearing rewards as you read this.Donald Trump considered by many to be the most disastrous democratic sovereign statesman in a long time absolutely believed and did as Gandhi stated above. In his wake he mobilised and motivated a generation of activists community enthusiasts and campaigners to put aside their differences to come together in bipartisan cooperation and work for meaningful change. They too in many cases have also being doing as Gandhi stated. And so they should continue to do so the world over needs to be openly voicing their thoughts from an educated and considered approach learning to accept one another but also not exploit each other an efficient and well functioning democracy is reliant on us as individuals to be so because our slogans shouldn’t be “BLACK LIVES MATTER” it should be “ALL LIVES MATTER”.

So it’s quite common to arrest someone who looks nothing like the perp. Mr Selwyn looks a bit like actor Samuel Jackson so we were expecting some potty language and were very disappointed at his polite demeanour.”Black protest groups have demanded that the offices who arrested the Judge be sacked. Sergeant Savage responded:“Here we go again. It’s not like we shot him or choked him to death. This is the usual total overreaction by the human rights brigade.”

To get the message through. To make things right. And President Donald told those Americans at the rally beforehand that they had to save their country. They had to go out and fight for it. President Donald promised to lead the march down Pennsylvania Avenue.So he kind of chickened out and decided to watch it on TV. But he was there and led the march across the street to Lafayette Square. Sure the military was there along with mounted police helicopters smoke bombs tear gas and rubber bullets but he marched across the street.So a few people died or got injured on January 6th. People die and get injured on Black Friday the day after Thanksgiving while racing into department stores to buy Christmas presents for their loved ones.There’s no 9/11 Commission to study Black Friday deaths or injuries. No need to set up a 9/11 Commission for the January 6th Capitol thing.Now Benghazi? We Republicans aren’t finished with that. Yet.Read more by this author:

The man Bob Prentice 52 of Stuebenville OH is being “well paid“ by the Trump Organization to play the role of Donald John Trump.The former president issued a press release earlier this morning stating: “the wolves are Breaking down the door and I don’t know how long we can hold them off. It's nuthing but a Giant Whitchunt!!”Trump went on to rant against the Democrats and the FBI.Sources tell us approximately 50 additional homeless people were hired to play role such as Democrats and no-goodnicks while four of the better dressed people were cast as FBI Agents.Trump’s press release ended with a flourish as he proclaimed his undying love for his “people” and promised he’d continue to look after them all from “the place you all may have heard of it’s called Heaven”.We spoke to another heavyset man who told us he’d originally been hired to play Trump but told us when he met the former president "he called me a fat slob”. He allegedly told his aides “this guy can’t be me! He looks nothing like me!”Prior to being sedated Prentice who won the role told us he needed the $250 to help his family and stock up his liquor cabinet. When he was asked how a homeless man had a liquor cabinet Prentice got angry and shouted “It ain’t enough for you I’m homeless huh?”The Trump Organization is hoping this strategy will provide plenty of momentum for the launching of a series of Trump-specific platforms that include the Trump Social Media HQ The Trump News Network and eventually the Trump Church of the True Lord.The ceremony began with the FBI Agents nailing the supposed "Trump" figure to the cross then raising it. Next came a procession of females that originally included Melania and Ivanka however both women backed out at the last minute and were replaced by models. Many signs were then posted to the cross in plain view prior to a photographing session. They included “Greatest President EVER!” “Forsaken Businessman” and “All Hail Trump”.At last check the Trump stand-in was still breathing steadily but also moaning in short intervals as officials scrambled for more meds. A dark-windowed limo pulled up as the ceremony was concluding someone resembling Trump and wearing dark sunglasses was spotted surveying the scene. He was then heard saying “Beautiful!” After taking a second looking at “Trump on the Cross” Trump was optimistic “he’ll be just fine better than ever!”

Or was it the master himself?Art specialists from all over the world are convinced a modern day artist put the crap there in honor of the impressionist master and are desperate to find whoever designed the crap so they can pay him or her millions for the brilliant piece of crap which left a massive impression.The bench in question has been removed to the Vincent van Gogh Museum where thousands of Asian art lovers are queueing up to photograph the 'Impressionist Masterpiece!'As for the poor Dutch cat he has reverted back to marking his area with pee because his pile of crap was nowhere to be 'sniffed' at and cat's pee tends to work more efficiently!
Tuesday 18 May 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152984/tv-programming-revolution-coming-this-fall-nbc-making-big-comeback,TV programming revolution coming this fall! NBC making big comeback!,Conventional wisdom might say we’re in the post-mortem era for the old TV networks that once ruled TV land. But senior management at NBC is determined to turn things around.After an extensive series of brainstorming sessions focus groups the combined efforts of three separate consulting groups and a team of NBC Network executives the network has begun unveiling the fruits of those efforts. Reportedly NBC has pushed in all its chips banking on the success of the new shows planned for the fall. And we daresay their efforts not been in vain! Here's a taste:Walking Small; An action-packed drama in a world of homunculi (tiny humans) who are in danger of extinction due to excessive homosexuality and sexual deviance. Their problems are compounded by their tendency to create settlements among normally-sized humans where the “eating is good” as one of the more flamboyant character likes to say. The problem is they suffer frequent casualties when they are stepped on inadvertently by their normie counterparts. Will they survive? Tune in and see.Watch Your Step: In this is a companion drama to Walking Small we get the perspective of the “normally-sized” people who harbor a wide range of attitudes toward the homunculi. The "good" people protect them try and help the injured and grieve for their casualties. The evil ones hate the homunculi simply because they’re different. They take delight stepping on them and even do some nasty things like biting their heads off for a chuckle. A number of sub plots involve direct conflicts between the good and evil big people as well.Clowning 'em Down: It’s 2042. Three distinct species of aliens roam the earth among humans and a number of human deviants reject society choosing instead to live in the wild where they organize and become dangerous violence-prone clowns. The clowns assume a "80s punk" attitude and carry on vendettas against seemingly everyone else including all the alien types and society in general. Lots of plot twists in this one as we suspect secret alliances form and the clowns develop certain powers some innocuous like squirting water from their finger tips and creating confetti out of thin air. But other powers are much more dangerous. The clowns are somehow able to fit battalion-sized groups into a Volkswagen Beatle. Unruly hordes of clowns surprise and attack innocent unsuspecting aliens and people. Can they be stopped?Monkey Survivor: Jeff Probst returns to host as a variety of simian species including chimps baboons macaques and gorillas organize as tribes and compete in the game of survivor. Jeff will discover early on that the baboons particularly are not big fans of his and that he must always be on guard as he even is the recipient of a nasty beating at one point before production assistants maneuver to save his hide. A concussed Probst is not too happy with his aids suspecting they intentionally delayed intervening. Mayhem ensues and it’s monkey to monkey man to man or monkey to man it’s always a gas! This is true MUST SEE TV folks!Wendy & Ellen Unplugged: In this zany reality show concept the fickle and always wobbly Wendy Williams is brought to a deserted island along with lesbian queen bee and funny-woman Ellen Degeneres resulting in a bevy of drama suspense lots of confusion unintentional comedy and much much more! In fact let’s say anything and everything you can possibly imagine. The show begins with an NBC executive notifying these two fading celebrities that this is their last chance to salvage their declining careers and suggests they use it wisely by determining the course of action that will put them back on top. So what will they choose? Will they work as a team? Will they duke it out? Will one use the other as fodder? It’s anyone’s guess!!

However in-between the aggro there are moments when the two contra-hands decide enough is enough and find a way of co-existing.Maybe that's the way life is who knows?Today the news broke that one our Spoofers has left the planet. Nobody knows in which circumstances but this particular Spoofer was a leading light here on The Spoof but his leading light lead sometimes to massive confrontations with others here.Maybe that's the way life is who knows?Anyway The Spoof will continue we here will all bow our heads for a second and wish Monkey Woods a safe journey to wherever he is destined. Many writers here thought he was funny witty and being an editor here a complete butthole!Subjective opinions divide maybe that's the way life is who knows?Writing is an art form even here on The Spoof. Albeit Monkey Woods contested this fact with Sir Jaggedone many times. We jested we insulted each other wrote fun ditty's about each other posted them for public viewing and consequently not one or the other won or lost.Maybe that's the way life is who knows?The End of a complicated literary satirical journey has just flown out The Doors of Spoof HQ. Others will come others will go who really cares? But behind the aliases of Spoof writers are real people authors artists nutters eccentrics who post their crap here to entertain a wider public. Some are brilliant some less some are awful some need an escape valve from the real world like Jaggedone. However one thing is sure sites like this sometimes pathetic one are needed good or bad liked or disliked just like Monkey Woods was.Maybe that's the way life is who knows?RIP mate.

The House of Curry. And I used to be pals with the owner's son. But it was forced to shut down due to hard times in the 1960s."I always knew if I became President I would make it our top foreign policy objective to secure continued access to delicious tandoori chicken."Biden said the breakthrough idea came to him after spending over an hour on the phone with an Indian call center trying to fix his White House cable TV service.

Fury confirmed he had agreed to fight fellow Briton Joshua - holder of the IBF WBA and WBO belts - for all four heavyweight world titles in Saudi Arabia on 14 August. On Monday a US judge ruled in mediation that Wilder has a right to face Fury for a third time before 15 September.It is now anticipated that Fury will fight Joshua on the 14th of August and an hour later after 'twatting' his rival he will then 'pummel' Wilder in the same ring.Indeed there are suggestions that The Gypsy King may take on both his rivals at the same time."That wouldn't phase me either" said Fury "In fact it would probably save time and be better value for the crowd and the viewers at home. Fuck it. I'll have them both at once. Pair of dossers. Bring it on."

They’re going to get in women’s panties and decide what women can or cannot do with their bodies panty-wise. After all with global warming and food rationing looming in the future it’s time to look into women’s panties.US women are basically stupid. These women aren’t in a position to know or decide or understand what they can or can not do with their bodies. So some guys wearing black robes will decide for them.But it’s okay if overworked women die in the kitchen or the freeway or the knee of life on their neck. Good-bye ladies! Gotta protect a sand-grain of life.Shouldn’t the US Supreme Court make some judicial decisions about men? Isn’t it about time men were made to account for their wasted semen with that living sperm?The Supreme Court should pass laws making men responsible for that wasting sperm. It's alive! It's living. And it is halfway to being another Donald Trump or Albert Einstein or Vivaldi. Supreme Court listen up! Make men accountable!Just think of the gallons and gallons of semen with sperm that never graduate into its proper lifeform? Barrels and barrels just flushed away daily? Living Michael Phelps champion swimmers that are left to drown! If those swimmers were mixed properly (stirred not shaken) men could easily populate all of Mars.Elon Musk are you listening? Forget bitcoins and performances on Saturday Night Live a disaster except for the mothers. Launch a Space-X rocket to Mars with that unused wasted unflushed away sperm with the lady ingredient and populate Mars.Like the Monty Python song goes Every Sperm Is Sacred.Read more by this author:

I cried I laughed and I truly felt for the people and their struggles.For a book such as this it was immanently relatable and witty the perfect combination for a successful autobiography and...book...such as this.Published as it is on as popular easy to access online writing platform the author clearly wanted to make sure that everyone had access to the lives and struggles of these characters and didn't mind the derision that may come with publishing under such an immature platform.In spite of its humble position the book has received many high accolades:
Wednesday 19 May 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/152998/what-s-up-with-rudy-giulianis-head-somebody-please-help,What’s up with Rudy Giuliani's head? Somebody please help!,Many people have been asking the question but no answer is yet forthcoming: Is there something wrong with Rudy Giuliani’s head?If the answer somehow happens to be “No” you’d need to rephrase the question to something like: What in the HELL is wrong with Rudy Giuliani’s head?!! — It’s become grotesquely oversized and seems to be getting bigger every time I see him.If you were around and recall the 80s you should remember the young version of Rudy. He seemed almost normally proportioned. If you saw him on TV maybe you’d think his head was a bit large but that’s about it. But you look at that same head today and you’re surely doing the Ricky Ricardo; “somebody’s got some ’splaining to do!”Is anyone worried about this? It doesn’t seem like it to me. This is where we get into some hard facts. It’s a cold cruel world out there and people just don't care - it sure seems like no one is left who gives a hoot about Rudy.But we need to consider this: Rudy is just another human being - on paper at least with feelings and emotions; a range of everyday problems etc.Plus he’s an old man with old man problems. If you’re young forget about it*. You have no idea. But take my word for it at his age and in his condition he’s a dead man. And to that you can add sexless limp joyless confused and in Rudy’s case clueless. It’s ugly.Bottom line is the guy is a nuisance. Worse than that a grotesque nuisance.And so it seems no one gives enough of a crap to care about what might be wrong with the guy. People must see the problem but just keep hoping he’ll go away. Maybe he will but what about the giant squash that he balances topside?Is there a doctor in the house? Time to step up.*this is the Guido version of the phrase "forget about it"

Joe doll to remind him of how lucky he was to have gotten 5 bone spur deferments during the Vietnam War.She said that he demands loyalty but not once in his 74 years has he ever given it to anyone; except of course to his 6-foot Barbie doll Ivanka.Melania revealed that even his two ex-wives Ivanna and Marla have said that if loyalty were sand Donnie wouldn’t even have enough to make a sand castle for a flea.Trump's third wife pointed out that now he is furious at Fox News because it has finally grown some balls and has now adopted the novel idea of finally mentioning most of his 20000 lies.A White House insider recently said that there are only five things that the twice impeached one-term liar does not hate; Big Macs Ivanka buckets of KFC chicken Hope Hicks and himself.

Wednesday 19 May 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/sport/152994/little-billy-belichick-and-his-women-the-genius-life,Little Billy Belichick and his women: The Genius Life,Back in 1976 Debbie Clark Belichick made the team! Coach Bill’s home team that is! She won the job of starting 1st mate and she managed to keep it for almost 30 years. But that’s not her sole claim to fame. Debbie is a great success in her own right with many talents as we came to learn when we spoke last weekend.She certainly has no qualms about telling the story of her time with the famously brooding and grumpy coach Bill. “He’s really a teddy bear!” she says warmly. “I knew right when I first met him there was something different about him but I couldn’t say what. He was so shy and awkward you know. A real misfit!”But as dorky as he was it seems Lady Luck smiled down on Coach Bill. Reminiscing on the old days Debbie tells us “my best friend Suzy and I were kind of perverse and we’d get a kick out of toying with nerds.” Sound familiar? This is why the guy is known to be a legitimate genius! His knack for being in the right place at the right time is second to none.“Suzy and I used to have a competition over how many nerds we could get in our fan clubs and I always won out easily! You know how it is with nerds all you have to do is make out with them and they want to marry you! Billy was a cute kind of nerd even though his mumbling got worse when he’d get nervous and I had trouble understanding him half the time.”We wanted to know was it love at first sight? Debbie may not be the overly romantic type but you can decide: “Obviously we knew he’d marry the first girl who had sex with him and I got there first!” she says with a big smile.“Of course I had no idea he’d get to where he is today. Couldn’t even imagine that! But then again after he made the big time he dumped me with barely a word! Well maybe a couple of words but I honestly couldn’t make them out.”I asked Debbie how she and Bill got together.“Well really it’s ‘what you see is what you get’ with Bill. No doubt he’s always been dweebish. Back then you’d never have thought he’d amount to anything. My mom predicted he’d be a bank teller but my dad saw something in Bill thinking he’d climb the retail ladder to become Grocery Manager at Stop & Shop or Star Market. Dad managed a Pigly-Wiggly for over 20 years and he thought Bill could follow in his footsteps.”“We had some things in common. Bill and I were just friends at first. We both loved football and he obviously knew a lot about the game. I didn’t have a boyfriend for a while and he slowly grew on me. I don’t mind telling you I was highly skilled in certain womanly arts…and Bill swore his lifelong love to me. That’s all I’ll say on that for now!” she says with a chuckle.During their 30 years of marital bliss they produced two children. “I love them both so much!” says Debbie “It’s too bad they both sound just like Bill when they talk…in that dreary monotone drone that just drags on and on. It got to a point where I couldn’t even process what any of them were saying anymore. I got very depressed. My doctor prescribed a regimen of anti-depressants for me in the late 80s but they didn’t help at all.”Showing some genius of her own Debbie eventually worked out a strategy to solve her problem. In the early 90s while Bill worked for the New York Giants Debbie befriended the team’s receptionist Sharon Shenocca and offered to provide her with a few tips on how to get a rise out of “Little Bill” as Bill was then known to Giants fans - naturally Bill Parcells was Big Bill. It wasn’t long before Bill was giving Shenocca a monthly allowance. Payments that didn’t stop until they had a falling out in 2005. Reportedly Shenocca considered her allowance a goodwill gesture rather than fee for service. Bill’s mindset was that of a customer and when he becamea disgruntled customerhe put a stop to the payments.In 2006 Bill met his current partner Linda Holiday. Linda isn’t sharing the specifics of her story but we can see Linda’s influence in Bill’s hair and wardrobe changes. The guy known as “the genius” and “the hoodie” hasn’t been seen wearing the infamous hoodie since his relationship with Linda was consummated in 2007.A source close to Bill and the team told us that sometime during spring of 2019 Bill started coming his hair meticulously and parting it on the right. “I’d never seen his hair combed like that before.” the source told us. The same source mentioned that Linda is partial to the annual late summer Back to School specials.“Just take a stroll through Target’s Young Men’s Department and you’ll see Bill’s sideline attire!” she exclaimed chuckling a bit too emphatically.“Linda put the hammer down!” she says with a big smile! Linda took action because she was incredulous at Bill’s indifference about his appearances on national television. She also claimed Linda tried to help him with his manners when speaking with the press but Bill reportedly locked himself in his room until she relented.Like it or not that's just how geniuses do things these days.

Cancel...i.e. No Life" selling like hotcakes on Amazon!,It's surely a sign of the times since it would make no sense in any other point in human history. COVID v. Cancel i.e. No Life is a new board game modeled after Extreme LIFE.In the game players move across the board encountering various recreational activities life events and random encounters; they are then required to name the reason why each cannot happen - typically it's either COVID-19 or today's formidable Cancel Culture.Players are awarded points based on their question's level of difficulty. Bonus points are available by landing on "DreamTime" squares which give the player a chance to take a nap and select from a menu of "Nice Dreams" that include a "Caribbean Getaway Vacation Play QB for your favorite NFL team Participate in an Orgy or "Police your town". Should they choose that last option the player gets to patrol his/her/they're town center and yell at pedestrians not wearing masks or otherwise for somehow appearing to enjoy life in any way.Points can be used to pretend shop on Amazon watch Netflix movies or online porn etc. Each player is encouraged to keep a diary of his/her/they're activities that they can reflect on in the future.Adding to the drama unlucky players might land on squares or draw cards that declare they are suffering from various maladies like heart disease fatty liver depression or a variety of others. The more serious the illness the more turns the player loses.In fact "COVID v. Cancel i.e No Life" has all the typical aspects we've come to expect from a board game the only exception being there is no winner. It seems we must accept this as another sign of the times.Reached by phone for comment Wolf Jokovic Comms Director for Milton Bradley told us; "We didn't feel it would be appropriate to have winners in this game. Aside from the obvious just think how disrespectful it would be to the other players."

He thinks his dad Prince Charles probably went through them too as he was growing up as a son of Queen Elizabeth the Second. The pains were caused by being left in the company of royal nannies while his parents were away on Royal Duties like visiting foreign countries or being shagged by Egyptian millionaires.These pains since they were passed down from one generation to another affected him in the genitals and other private parts. It is long-known that Prince Harry has piles as he has frequently talked about his “sorry ass” when he was younger such as “I dragged my sorry ass into the army and now I am dragging it out”. This also explains why Prince Harry is almost always seen standing up in all photographs and rarely sitting down and when he is seated he always has a painful expression on his face.More worrying is that Prince Harry’s son Archie could experience similar parental separation while his parents are away on important official duties such as Making Tons of Money from Netflix and Being Interviewed by Oprah Winfrey.Meanwhile Lady Colin Campbell explained Prince Harry's problem by saying "He's a pain in the ass."Or "arse" if you want to be very British.

He doesn’t get too concerned about the “small stuff”. But this morning Mr. Singer is experiencing personal turmoil that may torment him for years to come.It all came about because of a benign romantic pop song from 1984 titled: Every Time You go Away. As some folks know the second line of expresses the romantic sentiment: "You take a piece of me with you."But Mr. Singer who is a carnivore and a voracious eater thought the line was “You take a piece of meat with you”. While it seems to be an innocent mistake on the surface it is feared some blowback may occur due to the fact that Mr. Singer’s erroneous version changes the genre of the tune from romantic to...possibly folk?Attempts to reach artist Paul Young who for reaction have thus far been unsuccessful.For his part Mr. Singer is contrite but resolute. “I don’t intend to sing it that way again but after 40 years I can’t say if I might have a slip or two. I don’t see what all the fuss is about really”.Mr. Singer is known for his almost superhuman ability to consume large quantities of food. Friends say he's quite naturally gifted and even has shark-like mechanism that causes his eyes to roll up into the back of his head as his teeth sink into his meal.In an effort to capture this phenomenon we brought him roast beef hoagies on two occasions. However both times Singer snatched the sub and disappeared into his home only to emerge approximately 30 seconds later chewing non a toothpick.During one of his sprees at an all you can eat buffet he'd worked himself into an eating frenzy a panicked mom had to snatch her baby away from him just in time after he’d apparently mistaken it as edible fare.“That was an honest mistake” Singer told us in reference to the incident “there was no problem between the family and myself in the end that day.”According to eye witnesses the mother nervously asked Singer to keep his distance from the infant after the incident. Mr. Singer refused to comment about the shaken mom's plea.In fairness to Mr. Singer were happy to report the infant has grown up to become a healthy and vibrant teenager. There have been no reports of such incidents involving Mr. Singer since that time.

Friday 21 May 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/world/153022/other-gun-rights-organizations-put-nra-out-of-its-misery,Other Gun Rights Organizations Put NRA Out of Its Misery,“It had to be done.” stated Max Warner of the Americans For The Right To Blow Away Trespassers association when interviewed about the mass annihilation at the NRA Headquarters by other gun rights groups yesterday. “Their day had come and gone. They had become a weak and dying organization. They needed to be put out of their misery.”In an outrageous daylight attack by a conglomeration of leading gun groups carrying firearms of every make and model but especially assault rifles gun loving men and women of every age stormed the NRA headquarters breaching their security and annihilating every person they could find in the building. In a scenario reminiscent of the recent attack on the Capitol Building in Washington only much more violent they mercilessly exterminated everyone they found inside including the meth distributor.. Whooping and hollering through every floor as they roamed the massive Fairfax County Virginia building they shot at everything that moved.Shocked that they would be attacked by their own compatriots the employees and managers of the compound were slow to respond to the invasion. When they did react it was in a guerrilla style reaction due to the seriousness of their dilemma at being caught unawares. For once the NRAers were the prey; a situation foreign to them. Their animal nature finally did come through and they retaliated in like force against their once fellow Americans. It was a blood bath that would have made Genghis Khan stand up and take notice.When the smoke had cleared and the once all mighty gun organization was extinct Jess Leadloader of the A Gun In Every Hand Movement told FOX News “We were following the true code of all gunmen- you put a dying animal out of its misery. It has been obvious for a while that the NRA was dying a slow death. They were laced with corruption through and through they were going bankrupt the commie Dems were getting more adamant about gun control and LaPiere was caught wearing pink woman's panties. There were all signs that their time had come. We saved them from a long slow decomposition. We'd have done the same for a dying bear.”Police called to the scene circled the building and didn't allow anyone in saying that it was just simply the Darwinian Theory in effect- only the strong survive. They were also tired of the being the ones who got shot at by idiots with illegal hand guns which the NRA always supported.Rather than have a funeral or clean up the mass shooting scene Fairfax County decided to just blow up the building and bury everyone in the rubble much in the same way that happens in foreign countries who buy illegally sold American made weaponry. A small plaque will be set up commemorating the historic event.
Friday 21 May 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/153021/lock-up-crooked-donald-trump,Lock Up Crooked Donald Trump,Why the big need for an investigation about the January 6th insurrection of the United States Capitol? We already know the who and why. The who was Donald Trump and the why was because the sore-sport lost the election.He’ll probably start another insurrection in Sweden because he didn’t win a Nobel Peace Prize like Barack Obama won. Forget that he and the rest of his family (all Wharton graduates) spelled Nobel N-o-b-l-e but what bully ever won a prize for peace? Did the history books overlook someone?Before the election in November when the polls indicated Trump would lose he started to grip that Biden would steal the election.So after Trump did indeed lose the election the stolen election war chant began for real.“See I told you so!”Biden had the votes he already won the election and the votes were to be certified at the Capitol on January 6th. Certification is just a formality like the Inauguration.However like not knowing how to spell Nobel Trump thought if he could stop the certification he’d remain president.So he held a rally in front of the White House told his supporters Biden stole the election and that they had to march down to the Capitol and stop the Certification.So they did.How many hours of hearings and testimony are required to prove the above. It was already televised. Even Donald Junior’s girlfriend was televised doing a jig of excitement in the White House as the insurrection continued.So lock Trump up!Read more by this author:

No fools they! Men threw a wrench into the gold-digger process with prenups. However some ladies re-negotiate prenups before the husband’s promotion into the next big house.Lady God is rising. She took a nap after She and He God created the universe.Looking around at the world she asked “What the hell is going on? Did you sell out women making them servants because of an apple? Were you smoking pot? Again? Torture women while giving birth? Make a woman grow a baby in her body for nine months?“Embryos can’t even survive out of a synthetic womb or a woman’s body. And you call it a human being? It’s the size of an ant.“What happened to the synthetic womb? You branded women the weaker sex while I took a nap!“No wonder there are gold-diggers.

Or more accurately where do they think they are? This isn’t Peoria – it’s a jungle out there.”Of the 14 cyclists forced off their bikes by this thoughtless act two were taken to hospital with grazed elbows and one with a suspected sprained wrist.“I shall be suing” snarled Jerome Biggins as he cradled his left hand with obvious difficulty.Police meanwhile detained Jennifer Simmonds – the perpetrator of the accident – while deciding what action to take if any.Said Simmonds “I don’t understand it. All I did was to follow the traffic signals and stop on red. Doesn’t everyone stop on red?”With tears welling in her eyes she continued “Why is everyone being so beastly to me?”Shaking their heads in disbelief at her naivety  the two officers re-holstered their side-arms and escorted Simmonds to a sidewalk chair in an adjacent Starbucks.As the commuters remounted their bicycles to continue their journey many were moved to hurl abuse at the sobbing visitor. “Go back where you come from idiot!” and “Take the Metro next time klutz!” were among the more printable calls.Police later released Ms Simmonds without charge but with the warning to be a bit more careful next time.

Witness says "You had to see it to believe it",In a wild action-packed contest this afternoon in St. Louis most fans would have told you the game had a little bit of everything - almost everything that is! Until the top of the 8th inning that is!Three pitches had been thrown the count was 0-2 as batter Troy Flowers had fouled off each pitch to that point. Umpire Richie Hancock threw a new ball to pitcher Jack Flaherty then doubled over suddenly. He was approached by two other umps and the Cards trainer but shook them all off saying he was fine and stepping back behind the plate.As Flaherty threw the next pitch - a ball high and outside a bright flash was seen emerging from Hancock's rear end and the entire stadium was swarmed by an awful odor.Fans witnessed the formation of a bright disc-shaped object that shot straight back toward the stands for approximately 10 feet then took a sharp left turn toward left field. The disc vanished as it reached shallow left. However the odor lingered until well into the 9th.Long-time Cards fan Larry Keyes "I'd seen that ump pulling all kinds of nonsense out of his butt all game long but I never expected that!"UFO expert Nole Cackleford sat in the grandstand and had a clear view of the 8th inning scene. "That's a very common type of vehicle and can grow from microscopic to over 600 ft in diameter." Cackleford could not account for the odor however.Hancock left the field for a couple of minutes between innings but he returned to finish the game.The ump was taken to a local hospital for examination. He was reportedly experiencing light cramps and acid reflux but otherwise said he felt fine.

"But I made do BIG TIME!" the director went on while playing air guitar. "F#@%&ing-A!" he added for no reason.At first Snyder was really "bummed" that he couldn't use his favorite camera trick but then he became "totally stoked" when he realized you can play music over images running at 24 FPS. "It was a f#%%$@ing revelation man! I wasn't sure that peoples' brains could process that s#@! in regular speed and still listen to how radical and clever my musical choices are man but I think they totally can now!"Snyder also noted that Army of the Dead was shorter than his movies typically are as a result of the lack of slow motion. "I was really confused after it was edited and wasn't over three hours long" he explained. "I watched like twenty movies to get ideas for Army of the Dead which usually means my movie is at least three hours long to fit in all the stuff I liked."I mean watching Ridley come out of that factory elevator with the alien queen chasing her and be like Bishop totally f$#@&ing boned us dude and then just when you think her and Newt are F&^%$ed he shows up when everything is blowing up and you're like So AWESOME... Also a F%$@ing blowjob causing the apocalypse dude? That's like zombies walking around a mall making a deep statement about consumer culture deep!"Snyder noted that his own original ideas were not quite enough to push the movie over three hours even if it feels like it is when you're watching it. "Even after adding a zombie tiger yes a ZOMBIE TIGER so original... it still ended up less than three hours without slo-mo. I was like NO WAY!"Snyder also marveled at stumbling upon the concept of depth of field. "Like I had no idea that stuff got blurry if you move it further away from the camera man. That is SO AWESOME!" Snyder exclaimed. After accidentally touching the iris Snyder did his best to keep focus but had some issues. He decided he liked how it looked and continued to do utilize this technique until a grip came over and fixed it during lunch. "Its so rad when stuff gets blurry. I think it really says something deep. Its like your brain went swimming in the deep end of the pool near the bottom and starts felling like someone is sitting on it or something."Zach Snyder expressed enthusiasm about using the new skills and limitations he has learned during Army of the Dead on future projects."Like if I ever bump that light thingy again I would totally use blurry shots! They are so righteous!" the newly minted cinematographer said. "I really think that lubed up bods would still look totally jacked even if they're blurry. I can't wait to do this s#@! on my next movie because I still have so much to say... and stuff."

You might be hearing an announcement soon that will make you very very happy!” Eric only smiled and kept silent at the follow up questions. Some reports speculated that Eric was mimicking his father’s words preceding a few of his major announcements.It’s a matter of speculation whether this alliance will get off the ground and how effective it can be. What is not up for debate is that many liberals and democrats are squirming a bit more than usual today at the thought of what the three wonder kids might be capable of.

But the Son of Rudy added he has not made up his mind yet. He then explained that he's also often inclined to shed his clothing and live in the jungle with other wildlife."I've been on the political scene over half a century now" said the 35 year-old prodigy "and I know the game. But I also see what it's done to my poppa and I don't know if I want that."It was unclear which if not all aspects of his father's portfolio of embarrassment he was referring to but reporters on the scene seemed reluctant to ask.The young Giuliani then spent the next hour talking about his adventures in the jungle and describing the many ape-family friends he's made there. Attendees had drifted away one by one over that time. There were only two members of the press remaining when Giuliani opened up for questions.Asked when he might make a final decision Giuliani stared into space for approximately three minutes. The general consensus is that we'll be seeing much more of this young man in the near future.

Willowwiggins informed the news media that a 36-month research study has shown that a vast majority of Cuban Cigars have been found to contain large quantities of Femolotasitis which is an ingredient that has all of the qualities of standardized estrogen.Willowwiggins stated that in the 3-year study 87.8% of the participants (men between 51 and 74) were found to have very high amounts of the female hormone.The total amount varied from 59.1% to 74.9%. This clearly explains why many rich overweight men are now having to wear bras and have also started drinking exotic fruit flavored margaritas (i.e. papaya mimosa margaritas).Another female quality that many of the men have acquired is an addiction to watching the Hallmark Movie Channel along with finding George Clooney to be one hunk of a stud.SIDENOTE: A leading expert on both cigar smoking and female hormones has stated that these rather unusual traits can be reversed within 18 years of a Cuban cigar smoking male totally giving up Cuban cigars.

But it's the second and third verses that are especially disgusting! It starts out bad and just gets worse!"She is referring to the two verses in which the raspy Stewart croons:C'mon angel my hearts on fireDon't deny your man's desireYou'd be a fool to stop this tideSpread your wings and let me come insideDon't say a word my virgin childJust let your inhibitions run wildThe secret is about to unfoldUpstairs before the night's too oldAfter hearing the song on Friday afternoon Wendy shared her thoughts with her husband Jack a firefighter and the word spread quickly from there. Both "Wokers" and the PC crowd were quick to join the cause. By the next day an angry mob formed outside Rod Stewart’s Essex home waiting for him to emerge.Asked what particulars she found most offensive Wendy would only say "he sounds like a whiney rapist to me. It'd be sad if it weren't so thoughtless. It's shit! That's all it is. Self-absorbed rocker shit!"The parrot-like singer who was knighted in 2016 peaked as a performer during the late 70s when he became a mainstay on Top40 charts.As for what charges will be filed against the rocker police would not comment on the particulars.Stan Fister one of the leaders that emerged from the mob told us they would not relent. "Once they let him out we'll just beat the daylight out of the bugger once more."

Over the past week as we emerge from the COVID shutdown the eastern half of the United States is at a traffic standstill.For reasons still unknown all traffic lights in most northeast metro regions stay on red for an estimated 95% of the time. Reasoning for this if any has not yet been determinedPhone calls to municipal traffic management offices have gone unanswered and it appears many local government employees are still working from home to avoid possible exposure to disease..Intersections especially have become flashpoints for chaos and/or horseplay as drivers sit staring across at each other until they eventually crack and resort to property damage violence or complete loss of senses. There is no end is in sight to this dilemma.

Most parents die before their children some tragically and others in a so long kind of way.Caroline Kennedy’s father was assassinated when she was a child. She has never used his death as a crutch as a source of income or an excuse. And she has always been regarded as First Class.No family is perfect. But a family surrounded by the triple lap of luxury can still manage to raise one very spoiled child. As adults those children blame the family for their own shortcomings mistakes made and opportunities squandered.Blaming a family for choices made requires more years to grow up.To quit a job and still want a security check is like quitting a job and still want the coffee break—dumb.It is racist to suggest Princess Diana died because of racism. She just dated the guy for a few weeks. More pity me. Boohoo! Family bad.Princess Diana was in a car accident on a Saturday night. Tragic but true.Maybe a 9 to 5 job would produce a more realistic picture of what parents' sacrificed for children.Harry's grandmother is the symbol of Great Britain.

Harry is like the Princess whose sensitivity was tested with a pea under her mattress. Her acknowledgment of the pea proved she was a woman of great quality. However like Harry she sounds like a real pain in the gin and tonic. Boo-hoo!Prince Harry a second son of the Prince of Wales grandson of the Queen of England raised in castles palaces surrounded from birth with nannies servants maids butlers cooks chefs boarding schools tutors tailored clothing and a team of polo ponies always at the ready and with no student loans to pay off still had one gosh darn tough life. Boo-hoo!Instead of saying Thank you Harry complains that it wasn’t enough! He experienced a negative childhood because of his crazy Pa who was crazy because of his crazy Grandma and Grandpa’s child-raising skills or lack of skills.Harry could feel the pea.Would two sets of polo ponies have produced a better childhood and transition into manhood? Using an old fashion British term: Rubbish.The wish is that George Floyd’s children could have it 1/3 as opulent as Harry. Skip the polo ponies just the education environment and absent student loans.People should always launder their dirty laundry in private. But to take pristine laundry do a Mexican hat dance River dance and run the bulls of Pamplona on it and then have the temerity to claim somebody else is at fault (Are you following?) is clearly a bridge too far a poor show creepy nonsense rubbish transparent and most of all unfortunate and unwell.Strange that Harry received the enlightenment of his bad family after he said “I do.”Read more by this author:

Available soon!,As part of a full-scale effort to save humanity after the Great Pandemic of 2020 the Brookings Institute a leading US Government think tank has come up with an exciting new idea of government sponsored breeding stations (BS2021).The project has been dubbed “REPOP-2021”. Once it is launched breeding stations will appear in random places across the country.Conscientious people who want to help in the effort can report alone or as couples. Officials say that only sets of "biologically-appropriate for procreation" will be allowed to enter breeding booths.Some stations will be created in available building spaces and many more will be in specially outfitted mobile homes. Each standard mobile home will contain up to 8 subdivided breeding booths where two healthy humans will be admitted provided they are first tested and found to be virus free.Each booth will be fitted with a stereo system and a variety of pornographic materials to set an appropriate mood.

The next thing he knew they had taken a whole year’s subscription fee from his bank account using a forged bank authority.Mr Guest added: “The programmes were pretty shite too”.He pointed to inaccuracies such as a documentary that showed Winston Churchill as a slave-owning tyrant and another which showed the EU as heaven and the UK as hell.The chairman of the BBC released a statement saying “We regret the use of the forged bank direct debit form but are sure that it had no effect on swindling Arnold because he would have parted with his cash anyway.”In a linked story police have revealed that they want to speak to a man known only as “Bashir” who is accused of conning people into giving him interviews. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said “He offered to give an interview with the police but we didn’t fall for it.”

That nasty COVID cloud that just past was no exception. After observing some of our modified behaviors during the pandemic experts now say we'd do well to keep certain items that were brought about by the virus.Professor John Nerdelbaum Frink of the Springfield Institute explains "we need to do whatever we can to put each other at ease going forward. Therefore we ought to assure others that we're not a threat to them. The best way to do that is to declare: I'm safe!' instead of saying 'Hello'"Frink quickly qualified the recommendation by adding one must be virus free and vaccinated in order to use the "I'm safe!" greeting."If you're saying 'I'm safe' and you're speaking nasty bacteria well that shoots the whole damn thing to hell doesn't it? he asked rhetorically.Frank insists that is not too much to ask of people and for good measure he suggests we work the theme into the end of the encounter by saying "Be safe!'Frink warns "we're not going to make a wholesale change overnight but if we put our minds to it we can at least begin to cause the shift."So no pressure folks! Just do your best and...be safe!

Certainly wasn’t that always Mr. Trump’s goal when he ran for the White House?No one is above the law and an indictment conviction and jail would achieve Trump’s goal of making America great again. It will clearly demonstrate that no one even the incumbent of the highest office in the land is free from the long slender arm and fingertip of justice.So if Cliff Huxtable is doing time in jail why not Donald Trump Sr.? Great lesson for a Civics class.And what about the Trump kids: Junior Ivanka and Eric? And whatever happened to Jared Kushner? He seems to have flown the coop! Did he leave the kids holding the bag with the wall children at the border no Nobel Prize and the failed re-election?Kushner was also in charge of peace in the Middle East. More specifically peace between Israel and the Palestinians.Thank goodness Biden took over. Biden told Isreal and the Palestinians to cool it and with his executive ability COVID-19 is almost a nightmare of the past.No more Clorox and Lysol leadership a real President is in the White House and that's another kind of Civics class.Read more by this author:

You should also be happy if you hate debates! The CDC has figured out a way to end the COVID-19 vaccine debate. A very happy Dr Fauci today announced the successful completion of a pilot test run over a small Orlando FL suburb using high-tech crop duster style aircraft to administer the vaccine.The pilot went very smoothly with the exception of one anti-vaxer who fled initially but was ultimately covered.The CDC will release flight schedules later this week and their latest estimates indicate we’ll be doused with COVID-19 vaccine by early June. The plan will account for having all metro areas “vaccinated” by mid-June. The remaining rural areas will be covered by the end of June.Asked about the viability of this method Fauci said he’s been a big proponent of crop dusting the US population “for several years now”.Future vaccines will “very likely” be distributed the same way according to the doc. He mused that this will open things up for new possibilities. “We need this ok that’s the reality now! Our population too often strays off the farm and we can’t afford to let that happen too often anymore because there’s too much at stake.” Fauci showed no hesitation in likening us to common farm animals but then pointed out that it was all about the “greater good”

By his side sat his wife Melania. Ivanka Jared Kushner Donald Jr. Kimberly Guilfoil and Lara Trump rounded out the honoraries seated at the dais.Eric Trump was noticeably absent.

One of them Ronald Barker was very enthusiastic about what he's learned and told us he was going to enroll for an "advanced degree" as soon as it is available.

Just for starters we need to determine how useful a lighthouse might be out there in space."But Tommy Peckhold a life long fan of space exploration had a different take; "I don't care what those geeks say man! This is the greatest country this world has ever seen and we just proved it once more! As if we needed to right? Ha ha! In your face Russia! In your face China! Do me a favor and send over a pu pu platter. Make yourselves useful!

"I'm just glad he's ok." she told a reporter.The White House is settled back down tonight after a frenzied afternoon. President Biden was led back to the Oval Officer where he sat at his desk for a few minutes but he was noticably tired.His Chief of Staff Ron Klein insisted that he retire to his room and get into his PJs. When Klain was asked if today's mishap will affect the president's schedule he said "we'll be right on track."

And how do you think that’s going to go?Eric Trump will do the numbers yeah. Ivanka will give daily news briefings uh-huh. And Donald Jr. will be the spokesperson addressing the media while going in and out of buildings. His current girlfriend will nod in agreement.They promise to show and tell how and where the Democrats managed to duplicate votes vote for the dead reuse 2016 votes present votes printed on coconut shells (they can be purchased on eBay by the pound) votes flown down from Canada (can’t trust the people upstairs) and votes smuggled up from Mexico (the downstairs people are even more treacherous) Mexico is sending their rapists drug dealers murders and some good people...Rudolph Giuliani and his associates will help carefully monitor the money supplied by the Republican party uh-huh.While the Trumps are doing their own family investigation many states with Republican governors are also falling in line with the Trump theft and promoting their own research. Republican states are even voting out of office State Secretaries voicing opposition to the voter recount.Once Trump is officially recognized as the real and true winner of the 2020 election the January 6th insurrection and invasion and deaths and injuries and property destruction will be pronounced justified.No 9/11 type of investigation necessary.Like magic!Read more by this author:

Thursday 27 May 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/world/153079/trump-s-first-day-in-hell,Trump’s First Day In Hell,Donald J. Trump was only on the fifth bite of his McDonald’s Ultra Huge Gonzo burger with extra cholesterol when it lodged in his throat and choked him. Melania’s half-hearted attempt at the Heimlich maneuver did nothing to help the ex- so called President’s distress as well as did son Eric’s running around like he had his anus cut off screaming “Get a working class person over here to give him mouth to mouth resuscitation!” Once he realized he was about to inherit a fortune he calmed down.One second he was lying on the floor in a fetal position the next he was in a large building with uncountable large windows that looked like a big city airport terminal. Anxious people were seated or milling about in a state of extreme self concern.“Where the hell am I?” bellowed the ex-self proclaimed billionaire indignant that he suddenly found himself transported away from his meal at his lavish Manhattan digs and finding himself to a place so pedestrian as an ordinary airport terminal; probably New Jersey’s and in the non-business class section to boot.“That might be exactly where you are!” yelled some rube fifty feet away who was probably some Democrat who recognized him. If he had been wearing his MAGA hat he would have waved to him but Donny wasn’t so he just gave him the up-yours salute.Up ahead he could see a sign that said ‘The Chosen People’ entrance so he by nature assumed that to include himself and went over. An ancient man with a long white beard was the usher.“Good day!” stated Trump giving the man his best fake smile. “This is where I need to be!” and proceeded to barge his way through.“Hold on there!” said the old man pushing out an unusually strong elbow to block him from going in. “This is for special people only.”“Well that would include me!” stated Trump arrogantly and proceeded to push his way in again only to find that the old man’s arm was stronger than he could force himself against.“Not quite!” said the ancient one in an even voice. “There are certain criteria that must be met. I am afraid that you have not yet reached that level of achievement as of yet.”Trump glowered at him hostiley. “But I was the President!” He said insinuatingly.“That is a large part of the problem!” said the old one impartially. “You seem to think you deserve more than you do!”Trump glowered at him angrily. His eyes narrowed dangerously. “Do you know who I am old man?”‘I certainly do.” answered the old man readily while looking down at the list before him. We’ve been expecting you. “Donald J. Trump- born 1946 to Fred Trump and Mary Anne MaCleod. You became over the course of a lifetime a hotel baron a golf course builder and a television personality…..”“You got that right!” He tries again to push his way in but the old man effortlessly blocks him.“And a price gouger distributor of untrue ‘facts’ a University fraud a fascist leaning despotism and an all around obnoxious and discourteous fellow.”This tripped the fuse in Mr. Trump. He made a battering ram type of breakthrough with his arms but the old man was astoundingly sturdy and seemed to anticipate the attack. He pushed The Donald effortlessly making him fall backwards.“You see Mr. Trump you must meet certain standards before being allowed entrance into the area designated for The Chosen Ones. I believe you call the place heaven.”“So then where am I to go? I certainly believe that I deserve the best. That is what I was born into.”The old man smiled as he answered “And that is the cause of your downfall. You are insatiably always wanting more.”“And I shall get it!” roared the self-centered man.“And that you shall Mr. Trump! But not in the way that you expect it!” The old man walked over to another sign that pointed in another direction from which came strange angry loud sounds and unpleasant smells.” The sign said ‘Welcome To Normalville’. He opened the gate and motioned The Donald in.“Here is your destiny Sir!”Trump surprised yet intrigued took a few cautious steps in. “It sounds like some sort of party or something.”The old man continued to smile. “Not quite Mr. Trump. It is the destination you have made for yourself your whole life long.”Trump took a couple of hesitant steps forward and could see that the area was dotted with crowded tenements trailer parks industrial factories and run down neighborhoods. The people there were loud uncouth barbaric and violent.“What is this?” He demanded.“It is your own brand of Hell Fuhrer Trump one made by your own actions words deeds attitudes and creations. A Hell made especially for and by Mr. Donald J. Trump.This is where your own fan base your crowd your devotees come when they die. And you being their leader get to share it with them. Enjoy your stay Mr. Trump amongst those you sought to sway and control. You will be with them for a long long time!”Trump realizing what he had followed into began to scream “No! No! No! This isn’t right! Not THEM! Please God Allah Buddha! Anyone! NOT THEM! Anyone but them! LET ME OUT OF HERE! Where will I stay?”“Pick out a place on the ground Mr. Trump. There are no mansions here.” said the old man.Although an angel of righteousness the old man couldn’t help a smirking vengeful smile from coming over his face as he turned and left.

Yet no longer.Thanks to the easing of COVID restrictions travellers may now go nude on public transport as they used to do before the global crisis.“It’s nice to feel me scrotum against the rough faux-fur seats again” said local businessman Geoff Buy. “Those spacesuits were unnatural.”Others are not so sure about the changes. “If ye ask me” said bus driver Zebedee Khrushchev “They’ve eased the restrictions too soon. Who knows what sort of bacteria people will be farting and pissing into the bus seats now. In some ways it was better with everyone covered up.”Local councillor Wyatt van Mann explained the phenomenon. “I know most people outside the area don’t understand why we like to go nude on the buses. It’s a kind of tradition. When the first bus came to Chaffinch St Cock in 1983 people thought it would drive away with their soul. So we sat in it naked to make sure we could keep an eye on our souls at all times.”He added “Now come on love take that off. It’s traditional.”

When asked to explain he noted that it is actually very simple.Flickmeister no relation to Dundee and Sally Fickmeister of Boston stated that the roosters are all as horny as ever and as sex-hungry as always but the problem lies solely with the chickens.He revealed that due to a very mysteriously prevalent imbalance in the sex hormones of the egg-laying hens the female birds have sad to say simply lost all interest in engaging in the sex act with the roosters.Mr. Flickmeister pointed out that as frustrating as it is for the chicken franchise owners one can only imagine how frustrating and downright traumatizing it must be for the poor sex-starved roosters.

What More Could Bezos Need?,Paramount Universal and Warner Brothers: these are just some of the film studios not owned by Amazon Inc. (yet). The United States of America a lesser-known studio known for producing those highly-rated White House Covid-19 press conferences was previously part of that group but is now owned by Jeff Bezos’ e-commerce company (if he even works there anymore).In a recent interview over Zoom which is also soon to be acquired by Amazon the former CEO said he decided to make the purchase after seeing comedian Hasan Minhaj “tear everyone apart at that White House Correspondents Dinner a few years ago.” The interviewer chose not to tell Bezos that those are produced privately by the WHCA out of fear of getting whacked by one of the mafias that Amazon is soon to acquire as well.Bezos also highlighted in the interview that he was test driving his new super-yacht but when the producer said he was going to cut that out Bezos stated “I own you” which happens to be true. Bezos also made sure to let it be known that he purchased the yacht company that he bought from so that his yacht would “technically be free”.It was also reported by an unknown source that Ellen DeGeneres interviewed Bezos a few months ago but after feeling like he was acting hostile Bezos purchased NBC and DeGeneres herself in order to “can the interview”. This news reached the general public but was ultimately ignored due to Ellen’s “cancellation” (and no not the cancellation of her show).The overall acquisition deal of the USA included all of its assets aside from the Space Force as Bezos stated “I didn’t even like the show.” The deal also included a clause that allows Bezos to purchase some of the countries where US troops are stationed such as Afghanistan after 7 years. Bezos said he doubts he’ll do it because of their lack of factories.The deal has also caused Amazon to shut down the United States Postal Service forcing everything to be shipped through Amazon. This action has led to an extreme downfall in the junk mail industry so Amazon customers should expect to see it inside their delivered boxes.Bezos concluded the yacht interview by stating “We’re not too worried about what people may think but keep in mind that we now own the Constitution”. A recent poll following that statement showed that 73% of Americans feared the first amendment would be removed 25% didn’t have that fear and 2% wrote in “Kanye West”.

But it soon became apparent she had more on her mind.Now we know she had a couple of objectives. Number 1 was to get herself a man and she succeeded. She got herself a big strapping deluxe secret service man.Objective number 2 was to have that man beat the crap out of her ex-husband Donald Trump Jr. and his mentally handicapped brother Eric.As of yesterday Vanessa happily reported mission accomplished.Her secret service man who has not given his name waited on the lawn just outside the kitchen door off the east wing of the Mar-a-Lago yesterday morning. He knew the Trump brothers routine of running around the back yard after breakfast.He tripped Don Jr and watched him fall on his face then gave Eric a one-handed smack off the back of his head that sent him sprawling. The agent then proceeded to administer a beating to junior while Eric was able to get back on his feet and managed to wobble back into the house calling for help.Two minutes later a halfway made up Kimberly Guilfoyle came running and startled the agent and her screams could be heard for miles around. The aggressor who was sitting on Trump Jr got up and ran off. Guilfoyle and the Trump brothers are crying foul today and asking for help identifying the "bully". He may prove difficult to track down since his name is not known and it seems Vanessa Trump is not inclined to help her battered ex-husband.Both boys say they will tell their dad and they seem to think he'll be bothered by what happened to them.

Friday 28 May 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/153085/spoof-writer-90-dumped-twice-by-same-girl-65-years-apart,Spoof Writer 90 Dumped Twice by Same Girl 65 Years Apart,Of all the girls I dated - lots in my time which includes now - I'd only been dumped once before. I usually did the dumping. But this time at 90 I got the full--blown treatment. Right down to having my email BLOCKED! Me! A recognized contributor to The Spoof. Who once was nominated for a Pulitzer - [but not for something posted on The Spoof.]I'll protect the girl's privacy by not using her real name. Let's call her "Mylvia" - rhymes with Sylvia. I once knew a girl by that name but she would never have treated me this way so no one will think this is about her.This "Mylvia" however is something else. When I knew her in the mid-1950s she was kind gentlelovingfriendly - and any other positive qualities you can think of. We had lots of dates - square dancing a ball game a play by a Broadway touring company amusement park dinner movie beach - you name it and we probably were there too. That went on for two ears whenever I was in Southern California.That was part of the problem. I was at Berkeley and she was at USC. We first met when a group of Trojan kids drove north to Berkeley for the USC football game with Cal. All the other girls in her group had a male companion. When they were ready to go to 'Frisco on the evening after the game they picked me whom some of them knew for her date. That was the first and only blind date in my life.And the evening was spectacular. First there was this unbelievably gorgeous girl I was paired with. I must confess that after 67 years I can't recall the color of her hair or eyes Doesn't matter She was gorgeous. And here she was with this geek who was in over his head with a girl who looked like that. No matter. She made me feel at ease with her conversation. in the course of our discussion I learned that she was 19 with a birthday a few days away. I was 24 back at Cal after my draft service in the marine corps. Age didn't seem to matter.What a night! Mort Sahl at the Hungry I the premier night spot in 'Frisco. Folk singer Stanley Wilson at the Purple Onion the Hungry I's rival. I can still hear him singing Tom Lehrer's "Rickety Tickety Tin." about the girl who killed all members of her family one by one including her brother - and all that was found of him were "occasional pieces of skin Rickety Tickety Tin." Mylvia was in stitches laughing!The evening ended at a dive on Mission street Why we went there I have no idea but Mylvia and I went to the back wall where other kids had written their names and she wrote her name close to mine. [Years later I returned to the dive but the wall had been re-painted.] As we were writing a guy near us broke a bottle and started to attack someone Pushing Mylvia ahead of mewe quickly exited as did our friends and we made our way back to Berkeley.After two years of sporadic dating I was ready to ask her to marry me and invited her to my home for dinner to meet my parents. She declined. She knew what was up and she wasn't ready for it. I was crushed but I had dumped other girls before and that was part of the game. I knew the rules. We never met again. or communicated...until this week.I had been without a significant other for nearly a year because my 80something girlfriend died and I was lonely. So I decided to re-connect if I could with Mylvia. After all we had parted amicably. She married and I discovered her husband had died many years ago about the same time my wife of 50 years passed on. So why not email Mylvia?Why not? Because I discoveredshe wasn't interested. But I didn't learn that directly from her. It was pretty indirect but very accurate.Finding her email address was hard but a mutual friend gave it to me. So now what do I write? There was no question that she would remember me. But how to overcome that breakup so long ago? And what's the point of the reunion?I used the "we've both lost our spouses" approach suggesting we write to each other about our kids - I knew about her kids from the internet and we both had fabulous offspring. We could write about our spouses where we lived over the past decades where we lived now our work - lots of stuff to fill up numerous emails.I sent it off. No response. Was the email address right? I called one of her sons who said he never heard his Mom talk about me but he would see if Mylvia wanted to communicate with me That was early one morning. By 9 p m there had been no response. I assumed Mylvia's answer was "No"There is a sad Rod McKuen song a farewell lyric sung by Glenn Yarbrough which was appropriate for this occasion. "Hello's The Word Before Goodbye." I penned a short note quoting the song's title - I was pretty sure she had heard the song sometime. I began with a simple "Hello." Told her I assumed she didn't want to exchange email and said I wouldn't write again. The email ended with a simple "Goodbye." I hit send.As I rose to leave the computer there was a tone that indicated an incoming email. I went to the inbox and there it was. A Microsoft message indicating my message had been BLOCKED. I doubt that Mylvia knew how to block an email and suppose her son had done it for herI had now been dumped twice by the same girl 65 years apart! Is that a Guinness record? At 90 - next month I turn 91 - it's not likely to happen again - unless Isabela having heard how Mylvia did it decides to cut me off too. But I won't tell her this happened and she's too intellectual to read this on The Spoof. Thus I almost made it through life with only one dump. Now I know how Carol and Nancy felt when I dumped them rather crudely so long ago.Now if you happen to know who Mylvia really is don't tell her this is on the Internet. She might sue and my lawyer son only handles creditors in big corporate bankruptcies... and would bill me at $1850 an hour. What The Spoof pays for posts like this one would hardly get him in the door.But if there is an elderly female out there - do elderly females read The Spoof? - who's looking for an email companion get in touch with me via The Spoof. Better yet email me directly at reshaffer@cpp.edu. I promise you I won't block your messages!

Now we know. With most of the incoming news on Hunter Biden’s whereabouts coming from the New York Post including lurid pictures of Hunter balancing two totally nekid hookers on his lower abdomen each facing opposite directions it was of paramount importance for his old man to ship him off to one of the most remote areas of the World the Galápagos Islands.The following report comes from roving BILLINGSGATE POST reporter Elmer Smuckmeister.“From my perch on Wolf Volcano the highest peak on Isabella Island I can watch the comings and goings of everything below. Many years ago I chose to leave the hustle and bustle of Beaver Crossing to harvest bat guano in the Galápagos Islands.”“I virtually had the market to myself until just lately. Some young whippersnapper down the road from my cave had bats working overtime. Hadn’t seen so many bats around since I visited the Hillerich & Bradsby plant in Louisville Kentucky back in 1972. Sumb*tch must have been feeding ‘em ex-lax - bat shit flying everywhere.”“Went down the mountain to see the guy. He came outa his cave wearing a red flannel loin cloth and nothin’ else. I saw that he had turned a Giant Tortoise on its back. Asked him WTF he was doing.”“He whispered in my ear: ‘Traction Dude. Just wanted to see if it could gain traction while it was kicking its legs in the air.’”“I recognized the guy immediately - big idiotic grin on his face - playing with a bandalore as he shuffled around petulantly mumbling umbrageous mumbo-jumble; no doubt a dipsomaniac off his feed.”“He introduced himself. ‘Hi I’m Hunter. My Dad is President of the United States. Do you have any weed?’”Dr. Slim: “What a remarkable story. Smuckmeister at his best.”Dirty: “Yo Dr. Dude. He’s a long way from Beaver Crossing.”

The one where wood is stored or the one where someone metaphorically gets a spanking? Trump? A spanking? Is that like when Stormy Daniels rolled up a copy of a magazine and spanked Trump?No. A different kind of spanking but a spanking. Twitter and Facebook booted Trump off their platforms and no one hears from him anymore. Not that he was ever the voice written on stone.Editor’s note: What the Sam hell does that mean?People reading his stuff acted as though Trump were dispensing the Ten Commandments like God to Moses but in reality it was just stuff and neither God nor Shakespeare.Editor’s note: How can you put Trump’s name and Shakespeare in the same sentence?Reply: Okay.But in reality it was neither God nor Mickey Mouse.So now Donald Trump is sending his message via his own podcasts like Meghan and Harry but no one is watching or listening or quoting or seems to care. At least not as many as when he Trump was on Twitter and Facebook. So it’s like getting a spanking or being taken to the woodshed.Consequently Donald Trump is in a boo-hoo mode blaming the fake news media (The Spoof) for shutting down his freedom of speech.Editor’s note: Way to go THE SPOOF!Read more by this author:

Those good old terrified pals of Donald Trump blocked the truth about his treasonous activity on the January 6th attack of the Capitol.They are however unable to erase the visual captured on television of Donald Trump imploring his followers at the rally in front of the White House too "March down to the Capitol and go fight for your country."And his group of hoodlum-looking unshaven messy followers (Trump would never allow them into Mar-a Lago) did just that. And who should pay for the destruction and injuries Donald Trump’s followers caused?No stretch. Donald Trump of course. He was the motivating factor and he's caught on television doing so!So the Senate Republicans genuflecting at Trump’s feet could never expose Trump to a criminal jam-like that and they voted NO to a January 6th Commission to discover who was at fault.All Republican senators voting to protect Trump from his criminal activity will get a free pass for a round of golf at one of Trump’s golf courses and will not be Primaried (a Trump pick to run against them) at their next election.Now that is Democracy at its best! A round of golf and not Primaried!It sounds like bribery and blackmail but Republicans call those perks.History won’t be as blasé or indifferent. Their descendants will inherit a stain on their names.“You mean your great-grandpa voted to protect that orange clown? You’re shipping to Mars.”Read more by this author:

He is bringing a production crew to capture life on the orbiting laboratory.Maezawa recently asked the public to suggest up to 100 'silly' activities for him to try when he journeys into space. But he's since changed his mind and after thinking more about it. Seems he's developed a real curiosity for what happens when humans dedicate in space and now says the filming schedule is full.However he does want to assure the public that he will tend to the 100 "silly" activities on a subsequent space flight in 2023.Aja Itzo who is Maezawa's production manager has divulged some of the "dedication activities that will be conducted. They include one or more "free form poo's" in which the billionaire will simply let loose with a "mystery pack" of poos and at least two diarrhea sessions.One of the six crew members backed out after learning that crew members will be subject to collisions with the billionaire's poop. He reportedly is a germaphobe and felt the trauma would likely cause lasting psychological damage from the trauma.The rest of the crew apparently is more comfortable reckoning with the flying turds and will be all compensated. These experiments will be conducted in an isolated 14 x 12 foot compartment. NASA engineer Tom Torkleson thinks the compartment will nevertheless get quite crowded. "Given you have Maezawa and six crew that's seven people with all that equipment you can expect a number of collisions!"But camera operator Osa Seiko doesn't seem to be bothered. "Sure they're still turds but a billionaires turds are much different than say a homeless person or poor farmer from the Ukraine."Maezawa paid $40 million (£28 million) for himself and his film crew to travel to the International Space Station on Russian Soyuz spacecraft in December.

C.--Minority leader Kevin McCarthy today announced that Marjorie Taylor Greene in light of her recent statement comparing mask wearing mandates nationwide to Jews being persecuted in Nazi Germany would be reassigned from her committee work as the capitol bathroom supervisor to the newly minted GOP Caucus of Factual Conspiracy Theories known more widely outside of the Beltway as the Caucus of Tin Foil Hats.At the Caucus of Factual Conspiracy Theories Greene working under the supervision of chief propagandist Rep. Ralph Goebbels will be responsible for propagating what Kevin McCarthy is now calling the Little White or “Alternative Lie”—i.e. that former President Donald Trump did indeed sweep the Electoral College in November beating Joe Biden by over seven hundred electoral votes; and should therefore be appointed as the leader not only of the United States but ALL of America including Greene added “Canada and the country of Latin America.”Explained Greene wearing her signature tin foil hat “Donald J. Trump won the presidential election by literally tens of thousands of electoral votes and billions some say of votes overall by my count. If not for the reanimated corpse of Hugo Chavez and the Dominion voting machines the former dictator hacked into Donald J. Trump would be the legitimate leader of the free world on this planet.” Then foaming at the mouth the congresswoman roared “Stop the Steal!” and proceeded to bark madly and nip at Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez through her office mail slot before someone from the local no-kill shelter apprehended and caged the rabid congresswoman.Rep.

That's all it is.”Mr. Carlson then asked if Dr. Fauci could offer insight into the currently very controversial “gain-of'-function” research controversy.“Gain-of-function” research has been taking place in China at a lab with US influence including funding and an executive role from Dr. Fauci.“Gain-of-function” means working with dangerous pathogens as to how they can further be utilized or controlled.Recent mainstream news is now more heavily persuaded that the covid virus escaped from this lab rather than being a case of jumping from an animal in a wet market in China.Would Mr. Fauci please explain “gain-of-function”? Mr. Carlson asked.Using two fingers on each hand again Dr. Fauci stated that “gain-of-function” and “gain-of-wealth” were entirely unrelated versus what some critics had been saying.“That would mean “gain-of-health” research then?” Mr. Carlson again.“No no no did I say that? Let me emphasize—not 'gain-of-wealth'”!“No I said 'gain-of-health'” Mr. Carlson said now also holding up two fingers on each hand to indicate the phrasing.“Well as I said I'm mentally exhausted. I misheard and misspoke.”The Fauci party and the Carlson party then decided to repair to a Burger King on the edge of the motel parking lot for refreshments.“Does 'mentally exhausted' have quotation marks around it?” Mr. Carlson was heard asking as they went out the door.

He'll be held overnight for observation.

Many are erring on the side of caution by imposing a No Mask/No Laugh or Talk rule for their patrons.We spoke to Barny Rubbleford night manager at the Oakdale 99 Restaurant who explained the decision: "The CDC says vaccinated people don't need masks but how do you know if they're telling the truth?!! I mean people have been eyeballin' each other for 16 months and now all of a sudden they're going to trust each other? I don't think so. We figured the best thing we could do was to set a policy we can enforce. Anyone caught talking or laughing without a mask will be asked to leave immediately no exceptions!Asked when that No Talk No Laugh rule might be lifted Rubbleford says he has "no idea".We also asked if smiling would be allowed for people not wearing masks and found that may be a gray area. "Sure you can smile but if you do you should know that smiling raises a warning flag to us and you'll then be closely monitored for a time. That smile better not turn into something more. That's all i can tell you."

However last night 'Light blue' meant severe depression in the city of Manchester as they were 'Blitz-Krieged' by a marauding team of 'Dark Blues' led by a Prussian invader and his Prussian sniper who do not reside 26 miles up the East Lancs Road.This other Prussian Invader or Pretender who sees only 'Red' once conquered all 'Blue and Red' enemies who dared confront him! But his 'Red' flame withered and extinguished rapidly! There is a footy God after all thank the heavens!The 'Light Blue' side of Manchester is now hanging its head in the same direction as their 'Red' arch rivals who blew their pathetic invasion with one foul kick in the wrong direction.

Sunday 30 May 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/sport/153102/the-sexy-professional-boxing-milf-from-brooklyn-is-still-undefeated,The Sexy Professional Boxing MILF From Brooklyn Is Still Undefeated,CLEVELAND – (Sports Satire) – The sports media is reporting that 34-year-old Milly Mindafelli known as “The Boxing MILF” has just won her latest boxing match with a first round knockout over her opponent Delfina Dellaquill of Duck Dung Alabama.Mindafelli’s record now stands at an unblemished 31-0 and she has just signed to fight the National Women’s Federation reigning champion Barbie Barbentindo whose record is 47-0 with 41 knockouts.Mindafelli spoke with Dottie Bazooka of Sports Balls Illustrated and told her that he has been training 16 hours a day for 17 days in a row.She noted that she has actually sparred with three different male fighters so that she can get a better feel for how the extremely masculine-looking Barbentindo will react to getting her butch ass kicked from Cleveland to Cincinnati.Milly Mindafelli is one of the hottest sexiest females in any sport. She was recently voted by the Cleveland Indians baseball team as “The MILF We Would Most Like To See in a Pair of The Tightest Shortest Daisy Duke Short Shorts.”Milly’s ex-husband Bruno Mindafelli was recently quoted as saying that Milly has the body of a 19-year-old with no cellulite no stretch marks no spider veins no blemishes and no tattoos.Bruno then stated that Milly also has the prettiest hooha that he has ever seen and he pointed out tongue-in-cheek that in his 38 years he figures he has probably seen about 310 or so.SIDENOTE: Mindy is not only a bad ass fighter she is also extremely intelligent with degrees from Harvard Yale and Slippery Rock.
Sunday 30 May 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/entertainment-gossip/153101/is-there-any-salmon-fishing-in-yemen,Is There Any Salmon Fishing In Yemen?,After that fantastic film with a recipe for really growing salmon in Yemen did the film crew go back and see if that project could actually work? This would be an experiment in turning reality out of fiction?Fiction is pretty upset with always being dismissed as make-believe. It is always a first cousin to fantasy booted down the road and never given a chance at reality. It's like junk mail or a calorie counter or sheets of return envelope addresses. Chuck direct into the recycle.Salmon Fishing In The Yemin is a good film believable cast great transition from London to the castle in Scotland Yemen and back and forth never boring.And rumor is that the Ewan McGregor in the Yemen film performing as Alfred is not could not and never would be the same Ewan McGregor performing as Halston in the film series by that same name. Talk about fantasy! No way was that the same guy in both films.But this film seems to have the perfect recipe for growing and finally fishing for salmon in the desert. Emily Blunt did say the temperature ranges in Yemen fell as low as those in northern California in the winter where they have salmon.So is there salmon growing in Yemen?Of course there’s a war going on in Yemen. War is easy—more money in making war than in fishing. War isn’t even hypothetical like a man's mission to Mars.Just click your heels together three times and say: “There is nothing like a war.”And you’ve got a war.Which isn't a fish story.Read more by this author:
Tuesday 1 June 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/153132/innocent-fenway-fans-fooled-into-singing-their-hearts-out-by-evil-hollywood-plot,Innocent Fenway fans fooled into singing their hearts out by evil Hollywood plot,I used to scoff at tradition as a kid but grew to learn over the years that there is value in certain rituals. They connect us to our past and provide us a way of understanding our world as a continuum. That’s the value some traditions provide. But sadly some others are orchestrated by manipulative small-minded people as a money or power grab.Take for example the relatively new Fenway Park tradition of the fan sing-along on Neil Diamond’s Sweet Caroline.The "official" story is that someone in charge of the music at Fenway loved the song so much they played it frequently during games so it eventually became part of the rotation. They tell us there were a couple of games in which the Sox made big comebacks after it was played so they kept playing it or so the story goes. It was all very innocent. Just a couple of Neil Diamond fans who forced fed Bostonians a new tradition at Fenway. That’s all there is to it they say.Don’t believe it! An inside source has spoken up and revealed the truth. Once I knew the real story some things fell into place when I looked back at my own memories and experiences at the ballpark.LOOKING BACKI was at a few of those games in the late 90s early 00s. The first time I heard the song played probably 1999 it was part of a medley along with All Right Now Dirty Water etc. No big deal. But more and more over time the speakers blared out the song during the 7th inning stretch while fans sang along.Being at the park it was apparent there were a few people - or maybe “plants” is a better term for them placed among real fans. It was also apparent those “plants” could only have been assigned by team ownership to sing the song with some gusto and infect an otherwise neutral crowd infusing them with artificial enthusiasm. And It obviously worked!As I recall during those early days observing the crowd some of whom were so joyously singing along with the silly pop song my friends and I exchanged looks asking each other “what the hell is this?”After all it was the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park. An institution that prides itself on longstanding tradition and revels in the glory of those bygone days when the only meaningful baseball was played by white guys. Rumor had it that more than half the original team arrived on the Mayflower.There's one story that perfectly captures the spirit of this tradition-laden franchise. Back in the early 1940s longtime organist John Kiley was suspended for a whole month the first time he played “Take me out to the ballgame”. When owner Tom Yawkey heard it he blew his stack shouting obscenities at Kiley as he sat at the organ and accusing him of “going giddy!”The general attitude around the team was that If you wanted fads or pop culture buy yourself a comic book or a movie ticket. Fans went to 'Fenway to worship at the alter of Baseball an old-time religion.THE NEW GUYSSome 55 years after Kiley's suspension a new ownership group entered the picture to create a whole new movement at Fenway. Fans welcomed change because they were hungry for success after more than 80 years of futility; 1918 was the last time the sox won a World Series. So fans were willing to roll with the changes. Optimism prevailed and no one seemed bothered by the meager detail that was a cheap 60s pop song.Little did we suspect at the time that one of those vaunted Hollywood conspiracies was being hatched while we worshipped in earnest night after night at gay ol’ Fenway. It's just like they say the devil is in the details. One of the team’s minority owners is Tom Werner an executive producer associated with shows like Cosby Roseann and That 70s Show.THE REAL STORYOne night during a hobnobbing session involving Mr. Werner and his pal Neil Diamond probably at Werner’s place the guys inadvertently got into a pissing contest. In their defense I’d say it was the fault of the two teenage girls that were their dates that night. The girls pretend-laughed whenever they heard a quip by one of these guys and that only egged them on of course. Before long it escalated to wild proportions! Our inside source recreated the scene for us as follows:The pow-wow between Diamond and Werner and their young dates took place on a blustery evening in March 2002. Werner had his butler throw a couple of logs* on the fire while Neil spoke out on behalf of the many hard luck artists he’s known that though they were inferior to himself were much too talented to die in obscurity. Tom just chuckled and proceeded to patiently school Neil on the 'business side' of things in the music biz.Now we have to remember even at this time Neil is an aging legend. His best days are behind him and he knows that. He was in the cue for induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame but otherwise there’s not much else going on and Werner knows that.Meanwhile Werner was feeling his oats at the time having secured a place with an ownership team that landed a top-tier baseball franchise in the Boston Red Sox. Although TV sitcoms are his bag Werner can’t resist playing the showbiz bigshot guy explaining the way of things and how the big acts are made and often manufactured.Being an old pro himself Neil was no novice with such things but he insisted there were limits to the extent of the behind-the-scenes string-pulling. That was the opening for Tom’s testosterone-fueled clincher. “Tell ya what?” he began “how much are you pulling in annually for Sweet Caroline?”Neil was amused wondering where this was going. Then Tom jumped back in saying “Sweet Caroline! I always loved that song! What do you say to an additional million in royalties annually? Give me just a little time I’ll make it an anthem!!” It was music to Diamond's ears but he was still skeptical.“Just leave it to me and watch!” said Tom to wrapping things up.One month later a small army of “Wernerites” joined the crowd at Fenway saving their lungs for a mid-7th inning croon. Fans were mostly puzzled as the singing began but they soon joined in. After all baseball was the American Pastime (i.e. how we LOVE to pass our time in America) and the ballpark was a place for friendly cheer and goodwill – except for Yankees games of course during which mortal combat in the stands is expected and customary.NOTE: *Tom was burning “Hollywood Logs” that night. These are logs that come from the butts of top rated movie stars. These celebrities will typically notify their agent who will retrieve the log(s) from the toilet then wraps them in US currency preferably $100 bills before they are sold to the well-to-do.Sweet Diddleline?Around that time someone planted a story in local media claiming Diamond had written Sweet Caroline about Caroline Kennedy. This story gave Bostonians a reason to really embrace the song. The story implied it wasn’t a classic love song after all or was it? The lyrics do seem to hint at romance.But then again there was no escaping the fact that Caroline Kennedy was only 12 or 13 years old when Diamond wrote the song and he wasn’t a known friend to the Kennedys. It would seem there was something very sleazy about the sentiments expressed in the song by an adult male for a pubescent girl.That’s when we came up with an alternative title. Sweet Diddleline. We submitted it to the press. But before anything was reported the Hollywood woo woo went to work and the Caroline Kennedy angle was squelched. 'Damn those Hollywood bastards!' we cried.THE RED HERRINGAccording to my source when he sensed danger Mr. Diamond quickly came up with another story. He claimed he saw a photo of young Caroline shortly after her father was assassinated and was inspired (So good! So good! So good!) to write the song.That’s how these Hollywood types do things. They could care less about reality. Screw reality. Reality blows.You say Neil Diamond is a New Yorker who essentially has no Hollywood ties? That’s exactly what they want you to think!So that's how it all went down. Werner decided to play God to impress his pal Diamond and a couple of teenage girls knowing his pal could us some help with his declining career. Our source speculates Werner may have also benefited financially with possible kickbacks from DiamondIn the end the plot succeeded resulting in a serious grab for a couple of Hollywood goumbas. So what if they manipulate the hearts and minds of the people of Boston in the process? Who cares? We’re just sheep to them. Dumb sheep at that!Oh and the other outcome is that a few additional generations of people now know the song Sweet Caroline. Inevitably there are a few from each of those generations - that would be Gen-X Y and of course the millennials - who will be listening to maybe even downloading the song and if you listen closely you'll hear the ka-ching sound that happens with each transaction. And that my friends is what is being referred to in the song's chorus "SO GOOD! SO GOOD! SO GOOD!

What were you thinking? Huh? We only have eight seconds before we have to pay the bills and break for a commercial.”Same with a ballet dancer after completing 32 fouetté in Swan Lake. “Did you think you were going to end up flying into the orchestra? Do you count or listen to the music then stop? You did a great job. What do you think?”“Gosh I …”“Sorry Mikhail Baryshnikov is in the house.”It’s intriguing to watch Naomi Osaka play tennis. Same with Coco Gauff. So young so relentless planning the next shot in their minds. Landing a ball a hair away from the line. Interviews by the media aren’t necessary. Their skills already speak volumes. It was all done on the court.Watching their game is sufficient.But do something about some of those commentators please. Their constant rattle is like having people talking in the row behind you throughout a movie. They give constant unnecessary tennis statistics of ten or twenty years ago and it isn't enjoyable. Basta!However John McEnroe is always fun to listen to same with Martina Navratilova. Of course they’re former tennis players and watching the game.So let tennis players play tennis. It is supposed to be a sport. Not a march toward interrogation question time and are you ready for your close-up?Game set match—lots to love.Read more by this author:

If necessary we will blockade all Afghanistan seaports.”The United States along with NATO forces have occupied Afghanistan since 2001. Like the Soviet Union they failed to implement a sympathetic regime in this primitive country. The Soviet withdrawal was completed February 15 1989 signaling a complete default in their goal of bringing this country into their sphere after nearly ten years of occupation.Biden: “However unlike the Soviet Union we will not fail to fulfill our responsibility to the Afghan people. Under my direction we will continue our Navy presence in the area. As Commander-in-Chief of the greatest military the World has ever known I have ordered the Secretary of Defense to continue our Naval presence off the shores of Afghanistan until we bring the Taliban to its knees.”Dr. Slim: “I thought that Afghanistan was landlocked.”Dirty: “Yo Dr. Dude.

That’s all! I’m sick and tired of hearing people complain about fake news. I’d like to learn about the nuts & bolts and get to know some of the guys. Maybe find out what makes ‘em tick.”Biden went on to say he was quite a jokester himself in his youth “hey I like to laugh as much as anyone man! I’m looking forward to yukking it up a bit with these fellas.”No word yet from either the Jaggedone or Billingsgate camps but they are expected to accept the president’s invitations. Asked what topics might be on the table the president was a bit cryptic;“Well there’s something about the name JaggedOne that really has me going! I don’t know how to describe it to ya I just like the name. And as for Billingsgate the guy is a doctor man! Heck there may be a cabinet seat that needs filling up the line here.

Johnny Trump the bill for the total amount.The senator also noted that 83 of the official vote counters were brought in from the European nation of Pisagovia.And upon further investigation he divulged that the Pisagovians were only paid 75 cents an hour whereas the Republican vote counters were paid $115 an hour plus gas money food money and they also received 4 complimentary tickets each to an Arizona Diamondbacks baseball game.Meanwhile Nancy Pelosi is so angry at the rampant needless waste of taxpayers money that she is going to talk to Vice-President Kamala Harris about having every single U.S. Post Office in Maricopa county shut down.[EDITOR’S NOTE: According to the Merrimac-Webster Dictionary the word Maricopa is Mescalero Apache for “Honey I’ve looked all over the friggin’ teepee and I cannot find my damn rain dance boxer shorts anywhere?”]
Wednesday 2 June 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/world/153139/snowden-assange-agree-to-meet-in-boxing-match,Snowden Assange agree to meet in boxing match,International bad boys Edward Snowden ex-CIA analyst and Julian Assange founder of Wikileaks have agreed to meet in the boxing ring in what is bound to be a very evenly matched contest featuring two very wily and clever phenoms of the modern world.The idea was hatched by Russian promoter Yuri Andrekov who has gotten to know both men over recent times. Androkov is also a supporter of both causes and sits on the board at Wikileaks.The promoter came up with the idea during a strategy session with his fellow Wikileaks board members in which fundraising was the main topic.Androkov told us thinks it’s going to be “one hell of a fight” and says he’s and the two contestants are really looking forward to it; “these guys might have very similar values and beliefs but that doesn’t mean anything once they get in the ring. There has been very much friction between them recently and believe me they both want to get in there and hurt the other guy!”Recent rumors have been circulating that support what Adrokov tells us. There has been some nasty name calling and bitterness stemming from each man believing the other is moving in on his romantic interest. Rumor has it that Assange has made overtures toward Lindsay MillsSnowden’s wife of four years. Meanwhile the rumor mill has also produced stories of Snowden asking Assange fiancé Stella Moris-Smith Robertson to visit him “for a talk”.True or not the rumors have led to serious bitterness for both men who are intent on hurting one another. For her part Snowden’s spouse Lindsay Mills seems to think Androkov is to blame for all the animosity but she refused to speak with us directly – as did Assange’s fiancé.A White House source reported that when President Biden learned of the match yesterday he was overjoyed saying "I hope they bash each other's brains out man!"The well-known bad boys are fairly evenly matched with Assange having a slight height and weight advantage at 6'2" 180 lbs. to Snowden's 6'0" 172 lbs. On the other hand Snowden has the advantage of relative youth being almost 12 years younger than his opponent.The match is scheduled for June 22nd in an undisclosed location somewhere outside Moscow.

It made him feel badly about himself especially after he was zonked by a gravity controlled ACME anvil.For the Trump Runner and Wile E Biden to channel their mutual antipathy for each other there needs to be a vehicle for discourse.

It is feared that these agents will infiltrate federal state and local government agencies and bring about chaos and confusion.What is even worse is that - according to rumors one or two of the scientists have shared - possibly sold the formula with China. This would create a nightmare scenario in which millions of miniature says would swarm across the US running roughshod over everything we hold dear.The source could not specify how the formula works or how small subjects will get. Speculation is that the average human becomes approximately the size of a beetle.There are also rumors of Chinese scientists working on improving the formula with the possible goal of getting their agents down to a microscopic size invisible to the human eye. There is no telling what damage foreign agents of that size can do.President Biden has called a press conference for 2 PM this afternoon where he is expected to address the issue. Government sources are cautioning that all Americans should make sure their food and beverages are well secured. They suggest people double-wrap all foods and seal off all beverages to prevent infiltration by the miniature foreign agents.

Thursday 3 June 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/sport/153152/geoff-balls-euro-roundup,Geoff Ball's Euro Roundup,Hello! It's me Geoff Ball with your regular football news.We've finished with the European song contest for the year now it's time for the European football contest. And let's hope the home nations do better than they did at the singing.It isn't over until the fat lady sings and we haven’t seen a ball kicked in anger yet or indeed with any other emotion.So let's take a look at the upcoming Euro 2020 tournament being held one year late because of the pandemic. Let's hope it'll be pandemonium on the pitch and that the goals will be endemic.My pick to win the tournament has to be West Germany. They play as Germany nowadays but to me they'll always be West Germany. They put a few token East Germans in the squad and leave most of them on the bench. And we all know what West Germany are like - unstoppable. Never been beaten in a competitive match. So that's why they're my tip to win.Now onto the players. There are quite a few new heads - and feet - to watch this year.One player who caught my eye amongst other things - mostly balls - is Danish goalkeeper Johan Hoygens. You certainly can't miss him because he's a whopping 7 foot 3 inches tall. He's the tallest player ever to appear in the Euros.In fact he's so tall that if he wore high heels he would almost bump his head on the crossbar. Thankfully he doesn't wear them. He wears sensible football boots instead in a gigantic size 24. I don’t know if that’s European or UK sizes. Honestly I don’t think it matters. Not only that but his hands are a foot wide. It really makes you think.Moving on the Dutch have a controversial player in their team. She or should I say he? - it's a genuine question. She used to be a woman but now he's a bloke.Anyway Jan Outen will no doubt cause great confusion in the showers because she hasn't had full gender reassignment surgery yet. Is that right Bill? Bill's nodding. Haven't they got a separate shower for her? It seems a bit unfair.I'm sure she/he will show that women can play football almost as well as men although I guess she'll be able to run a bit faster without having balls getting in the way. By which I mean her testicles.Also you know when the players line up in a wall for a penalty with their hands covering their bit. Well she I mean he won't need to worry about that.Actually I first saw her playing in the women’s league a couple of years ago and I thought she looked quite attractive. She's kept her hair long too so just remind yourself that it's a man. Sort of. Suppress those thoughts!My final player to watch for the tournament was - maybe still is - a superb striker but he has had a bit of a mishap. He's Dimitri Bulgarov of Russia and last week he tweeted something disrespectful about the Russian President Vladimir Putin. And you know what he's like.After the tweet Bulgarov was taken off the team and he hasn't been seen since. Which is a shame because we won't get to see his great skills on the ball. Still our loss is the gulag squad's gain.That's been my roundup for Euro 2020. Let the goals commence!

Trump Pee-Pee Tape and asked him if he had seen it.McCarthy turned as pink as a Connecticut carnation giggled like a grade school girl and admitted that he had in fact seen the disgustingly disgusting infamous video.“I heard you saw it nine times?” Behar asked.“Yes Miss Behar "I saw the documentary tape nine times” the three-faced Chupacabra-looking senator replied."Well hallelujah!" shouted host Sonny Hostin noting that that was the first damn truthful thing that the mothereffen SOB had said during the entire show.In Other News.

This includes Madison Square Garden all copyrights and all the fans who complained about his “Foul Baiting” after game one of his first-round matchup against their team.In a recent interview with NBA Owners Bi-Monthly Dolan said “[Trae Young] basically owns the team already but I feel it’s appropriate to make it official.”Fans responded to this news by blowing up the building Dolan resided in for the past 2 years similar to the way they did it in “F**** C***” but here they didn’t warn the others living/working in the building. The travesty was avoided by the former Knicks owner who is said to be living in Trae Young’s guest house in Atlanta Georgia.All this recent news and his smug face have caused a bounty to be placed on Young in New York City. The action that would otherwise be illegal was pardoned by current NYC mayor Bill DeBlasio who published a video after game one of the series expressing his disappointment of Young’s “Foul Baiting”.Trae Young was asked to make a statement of his next steps for the team but declined saying he has to focus on the Hawks’ upcoming series against the Philadelphia 76ers.

With the whole world watching Trump is giving speeches saying he’ll be back in the White House by August. And not as a paperhanger or gardener or chauffeur but as President of the United States.The rest of the world must be asking "What kind of a nut job is Donald Trump? And this guy had his finger on the nuclear button?"Trump is insisting that Biden stole the 2020 election.The real stolen election was in 2016 by Donald Trump. How could three predominately Democratic states (Michigan Wisconsin and Pennsylvania) with a total number of only 80000 votes put Trump over the top win the Electoral College votes and the Presidency?A Trump win by just 80000 votes? Hillary Clinton received over 3 million more popular votes than Trump. And don't forget seventeen US intelligence agencies agreed that Russia interfered with the 2016 election. Who really stole an election?So Trump thought since he won the 2016 election (with a helping hand from Russian hackers) naturally it should work again for 2020.It didn't. Ah-ha! It must have been stolen.If you steal one candy bar you have experience. Right? Stealing the second candy bar should be a shoo-in. No? What? It didn’t work? I didn't get my second candy bar?Ah-ha! Biden stole my second candy bar. The 2020 election was mine. Pee-yew!"But I'll be in the White House by August" says Trump.Yeah sure! Well some house.Not White.Read more by this author:

Seemed Donald J. was primed for bullying and Cruz had a giant bulls eye on his forehead. Trump and his wife Melania dropped in on the Cruz household early evening around 6:30 pm yesterday.Trump wasted no time setting upon his former rival. When Cruz put his hand out for a shake Trump with a big smirk reached over and pinched Cruz's nipple then twisted hard. The senator was obviously in serious pain but managed a chuckle passing it off as good natured fun. Trump then noted that Mrs Cruz was "still ugly as ever" and suggested that his hosts "say hello to Melania" even though they had greeted her already.Trump followed that up with a steady flow of slights and insults aimed at Cruz who seemed very uncomfortable. Cruz made several attempts to steady himself trying to crack a joke or tell a story but he was thwarted by Trump every time who cut him short with a "shut up Ted" or "nobody cares Ted".One observer noted that aside from a few of Melania's two or three word sentences "there wasn't a complete sentence uttered all evening".Cruz eventually became pale and his eyes appeared moist but he seemed determined to go the distance and finish the evening on his feet. Sensing his host on the ropes Trump became more aggressive and cruel as the night wore on.As the guests prepared to leave Trump punished Cruz with a final barrage of barbs then getting a little carried away with his success set a fire in a hall closet before leaving with his wife.Cruz ran to douse the fire and later told the press "It was an accident -there was no significant damage whatsoever."Cruz also said "It was an honor to have a visit from a wonderful couple like that! Heidi and I had a great time!"There was much speculation leading up to the visit fueled by Cruz himself that Trump would be asking for Cruz's advice and ultimately his support for 2024. But when asked about this after the visit Cruz said "No we were off the clock - this wasn't work we were kicking back and enjoying ourselves!"Asked if he'd be willing to host the Trumps again Cruz emphatically declared "They're welcomed at our place any time!"

Very few noticed the “giant hairy guy” who sat brooding in a far corner beyond the pool table by the Men’s bathroom.“He kept his head down and looked like he just wanted to be left alone. Big guy like that…you don’t want to piss him off you know? I saw red in his eye when he looked up at one point but I figured the guy was inebriated. So I just thought it best not to engage since he wasn’t causing any problem.” So said bartender Frankie Murton who said the “big guy” was there perched in the corner booth when he got to work at 7 pm. “There were a few bottles of beer on the table. I counted a total of seven beers. They were Millers. But he was nursing them I guess because he was there almost four hours while I was here.”Efforts to reach owner Bill Hackett who was on duty before Murton have so far been unsuccessful. Murton told us that sometime between 10:45 and 11 pm he looked over and the “patron” was gone.Shortly afterward when he went to the bath room he saw the window frame had been broken likely from the creature squeezing through to leave the premises.Merton said he went right to the table after seeing the damage and found two brass buttons and a turkey feather apparently left as a tip.Outside the bar in the parking lot Spider Murphy was sitting in his car with an unidentified female when they heard the sound of wood breaking. “I looked over there and saw this big hairy ape comin’ out the window. Honestly I thought I was hallucinating!”Off duty police officers who were apparently on the scene at that time (11 pm) discovered a trail of 15” footprints leading away from the building into the woods.This morning there were reports of a creature with a similar appearance walking briskly through a downtown area. It is not known if these are two different individuals or the same creature.Enthusiasts are planning to conduct a wide-scale search in an effort to spot the bipedal creature later today.

Similar to that message this one came to him as he sat in church last Sunday morning.Jackster described being "locked in" to a golden beam of light "just about halfway through the service" led by Minister Jeremiah Jones. At that point the psychic claims he sat face to face with God himself and after "a bit of small-talk and niceties" The Lord proceeded to describe to Jackster the exact scenario that would save humanity."God was very specific in his instruction that we are not to discourage the wide range of angry groups of people from going at each other. He told me these people are all hopelessly lost and require a reset - which I took to mean they need to start over. The Lord did tell me he still loves them but that he just cannot help them at this point.""It's akin to the circular firing-squad." Jackster explained. He was unclear about time frames but he believes the process is well underway.As for the rest of us Jackster was upbeat; "I know that once we get through this ugly time we'll have smooth sailin'. But for now tread carefully and keep your eyes open!"

Sunday 6 June 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/153186/why-is-it-that-bald-headed-kids-always-seem-to-get-cancer-asks-wanker,Why Is It That Bald Headed Kids Always Seem To Get Cancer? Asks Wanker.,FORT LAUDERDALE Fla. — After friends family and classmates came together to support a South Florida kid fighting cancer local man Kevin Rogerson was overheard asking his wife why was it that a disproportionate of bald children seemed to catch cancer.Merideth Taylor was diagnosed with B-Cell Lymphoma at age of 11 and is Kevin's wife's niece.She begins treatment next week at the Saint Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis so family and friends drove by her house to encourage her before she began treatment. It was during this driveby that Kevin noted the odd correlation between kids with cancer and baldness."I'm no expert but as far as I can tell bald kids get cancer more than kids with full heads of hair. Just walk around any hospital and you will see most of them are bald as fuck. If I had a kid I would not promote shaving their head. You are literally playing with fire if you ask me. Put the clippers away for fucks sake. Wake up people."Kevin has since set up a Go-Fund-Me page where he will be accepting donations to seek alternative treatment for Meredith."I'm thinking that if we can somehow stop these kids shaving their heads or stop them from going bald we may be able to reduce cancer rates. Therefore every dollar donated will be spent on getting a Meredith a hair transplant. If my theory is correct then maybe just maybe I will have found the cure for cancer."

Sunday 6 June 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/sport/153184/download-your-free-euro-2020-tournament-planner-here,Download your free Euro 2020 tournament planner here,Are you planning to watch the Euro 2020 footballing competition?Well don't until you've planned your viewing schedule using TheSpoof's own handy easy-to-use Euro 2020 footballing competition tournament planner. Geoff Ball explains.Simply write down the times and participants of each match on the day in the calendar where you plan to watch them. Then when the day comes around look at the calendar to see which matches you are going to watch.The genius of TheSpoof's Euro 2020 footballing tournament planner is that you can also plan what to do on the days when you don't want to watch a match. For example you can write "go for a walk" or "visit the pie shop" to remind yourself to do that. It's so useful that I bought two and I'm going to use the other one next month when there's no matches on anyway.So now you've got your schedule planned how are the organisers going to decide who plays what match and how will the tournament end.Let me explain. There's no randomness or coin tossing here except for at the start of each match when a coin is tossed to decide who picks their shirt colour first.Twenty four teams qualified some were personally selected by UEFA others qualified because they won previous tournaments and some through the jury voting system.There is a reason for having twenty four teams in the tournament it's so that they can have one for each hour of the day. They're all going to stand on a giant podium in the shape of a clock in the closing ceremony which I'm sure will look fantastic.The teams are divided into six groups. Every team in the group plays every other team in the group except for itself and only once. But it's not like a league - not at all - there's a very important difference.So for example let's take England. They play the third team in the league - I don't have the schedule here so let's just call the other team Australia.England play Australia once then move on to the next team we'll call them West Indies. Then finally they play Pakistan and whoever has the most wickets will go top of the group.But that's not all because Australia also need to play against West Indies and Pakistan and then those last two teams need to play each other too - not at the same time of course.Now I think about it it is just like a league.The winners of each group go through to the sixteenths round then the winners of those progress to the octagonal round.The winners of that progress to the quarters finals where the losers then go on to play the third place play off.Then the two remaining teams that won the semi finals - I forgot to mention the semi finals. The winners of the semi finals will have first won the quarter finals and then won the semi finals. The losers of the quarter finals go home in contradiction to what I said earlier. I mean they all go home eventually.Then the losers of the semifinal play in the third place playoff match the winners play in the final and finally there's a second place match between the loser of the final and the winner of the third place playoff.The winner of the final has won the tournament. Unless it's a draw then they'll go by alphabetical order. Which is why I'm supporting Austria.
Sunday 6 June 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/world/153183/the-debate-is-over-official-definition-of--numbnuts--going-on-record-monday,The debate is over! Official definition of “Numbnuts” going on record Monday!,Winston Rumford is a world-renowned linguist who specializes in off-color slang and derogatory terms. When Rumford learned of the ongoing debate about the meaning of the term “numbnuts” he became resolved to come up with the definitive answer.He says it didn’t take him long at all. In fact he claims it took only 90 minutes when he sat down and was committed to rolling up his sleeves and digging in.Rumford held a press conference early this morning to unveil the fruits of his labor. There was no doubting Rumford’s credibility as he spoke with confidence and authority:“The definition is quite straight-forward for anyone willing to view it with a wide angle and apply their mind in earnest. Our primary objective as humans is to procreate. When a male human has numb nuts it means he cannot fulfill his purpose and is in effect useless. He is of no value to anyone as a member of his species. That’s what numbnutted means; to be useless non-functioning person.”When he finished Rumford received an enthusiastic round of applause from the 40 or so reporters many of whom stood. Everyone in attendance received a copy of Rumford’s notes that showed his deliberation and thought process complete with assumptions and a couple of possibilities that were considered then dismissed. Rumford self-deprecatingly referred to these four pages as his “chicken-scratches”.The press conference culminated with a telephone call with Carla Hayden Deputy Librarian with the Library of Congress who seemed genuinely delighted with Rumford’s definition and agreed to add his work “with much pride” to the public record.Hayden opined that "this term's popularity is now poised to soar with the clarity of meaning that Professor Rumford has brought to the table."The librarian ended the call with a good-natured jab at reporters; "I can't say for sure but given the track record I'm sure many of you media members in attendance are hopelessly numbnutted!"

He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall.” Clearly enthused Mr. Biden has been inspired to invent “New Hobgoblin Awards” (and ceremonies) for 2021.Somebody then asked would not the president himself as well as Mr. Fauci be up for this award?As with his hardline on Russia back in February when Mr. Biden said he believes President Putin is a killer “I really do” to a more recent tone of conciliation for an upcoming meeting this month.As with earlier in the year saying China is not a threat and now saying he will be tough on China.As with calling secret investigations and gag orders directed at the press “simply simply wrong” while the Biden DOJ has been secretly acquiring information on reporters regarding leak investigations.Mr. Biden's accuser of sexual misconduct Tara Reade might also be a candidate for this award according to White House advisors except that she would have trouble with eligibility due to the “great mind” qualification.Mr. Biden's hound Major is also reported on the list due to being more conciliatory these days after two incidents of taking a bite out of White House visitors.Whether Major has actually apologized according to news reports is not yet clear. He has been observed with bowed muzzle and an unusual amount of tail thumping.Plus there is "the great mind" issue again.Indeed Mr. Fauci and Mr. Biden himself are foremost as models in this “great mind” area according to mainstream media experts on this matter.

But not all of us by any means. An unexpected development that transpired over the past 18 months is a significant number of people discovered they found comfort even joy from living the COVID life. There is something about the isolation the extreme safety precautions the abundance of personal space and even the scowling at slackers that some people just do not want to part with.If you’ve been out and about chances are you’ve had the good fortune to encounter one of these fine folks (unless of course you are actually one of them) and have been the target of the Corona Scowl on a narrow sidewalk the supermarket or – one of my favorites on the elevator.Today the Dr Anthony Fauci backed by the CDC announced that the feelings of such people are perfectly valid and must be respected. The doctor said he plans to petition congress to establish a holiday to honor these folks with the possibility of requiring the rest of the population to “shelter-in-place” and give the COVID lifestyle extremists an opportunity to maximize their space in peace.Fauci finished by encouraging them to live the lifestyle for as long as they’d like! For the rest of their lives or even longer if they’d like!

It seems at his first and last CPAC rally since being removed from office by the voters Donald Trump gave his speech in the state of Georgia wearing his pants backward. Like a lady’s skirt zipper in the back.There were several close-up photographs on the internet and sure enough that’s what it looked like. Maybe he had an accident and didn’t fly into Georgia with an extra pair of pants. So viola put them on backward extend the red tie button the jacket and no one will notice.Dream baby dream! The tie didn’t extend that far and the jacket didn’t remain buttoned.Of course devoted male MAGA fans will adopt the same fashion and begin wearing their pants backward to show their support and devotion to whatever Trump may do.Anything you will do we will do better... Ted Cruz will jump in feet first as will Marco Rubio and Mitch McConnell.Before jumping in feet first maybe some hacker did a job on Trump’s pants and superimposed the back to front in a War Of The Worlds kind of way? Not nice but ... can be done. The same hacker could put a strapless dress on Trump and sure enough there go his MAGA male supporters wearing strapless dresses to rallies.Pants on backward weren’t the amazing thing about Trump’s come-back rally on Jekyll Island. The audience booed Governor Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Ratffensperger who defended the state's legal vote.Maybe they should have worn their pants backward to win MAGA applause and support?Read more by this author:

When traveling people will be transported to the closest station and “wait for the Earth’s rotation to do all the work”.Asked what we’ll do about traveling in an eastward direction Kurzweil replied “All travel will be westerly. You ought to know that you can go west and still end up at a destination to the east. You see? And when the planet is doing all the moving there’s no danger of accidents or collisions – well except for the occasional meteor of course."Kurzweil estimated the hover stations will be positioned approximately 10 feet off the ground and will be completely safe unless an individual carelessly falls over the side. He pointed out the added benefit of having more time with loved ones. "Let's say you live in Boston and have a business meeting in Antwerp You hop on the hover platform to leave and can expect to arrive in approximately 17 hours. Meanwhile you will have some time to converse with your spouse children or friends standing below the platform you see?"Asked about possible dangers like rogue waves when hovering over the Pacific Ocean the futurist dismissed the notion. "Those hover boards will be indestructible. All you need to do is make sure you're secured on the surface with whatever means we decide to use. It could be a velcro surface and passengers might be required to wear velcro clothes for all I know at this point."

Manchester United just happen to be over-qualified in the art of bunging £billions out of the window ever since Sir Alex left the club.However this latest strategy is quite genial! Instead of letting new players attempt to play for United's first team they will be loaned out all over the planet to every pro- club that exists even in Borneo!

Tuesday 8 June 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/153198/manhattan-shrink-fantasizes-unloading-revolver-into-head-of-white-person,Manhattan Shrink Fantasizes Unloading Revolver Into Head Of White Person,BILLINGSGATE POST: Elmer Smuckmeister a retired farmer living in Beaver Crossing Nebraska was proud of the Yale diploma he had nailed to the wall of his barn right next to a picture of his 4-H heifer Ellie who won first prize at the 1960 State Fair in Lincoln Nebraska. Along with the Blue Ribbon he received for his beloved heifer Elmer was granted a scholarship to Yale University.Elmer was a classmate of John Kerry who also graduated from Yale in 1966. Elmer went on to great things while Kerry latched on to a money bag heiress to the Heinz 57 fortune insuring that he would never have to lift a finger his entire life.Smuckmeister made a fortune with his invention of the Montana Pole. The pole was a clever adaptation of a pitchfork handle with a mirror attached to one end - which sold like hotcakes to the beleaguered sheepherders who wanted to see if their beloved sheep was smiling when they mounted it from behind. The filthy lucre he scored from his invention made him rich. He donated millions to his alma mater. Because of his generosity The “Smuckmeister Memorial Outhouse” a three hole shitter stands proudly on Yale’s campus green; an ecological symbol of Elmer’s humble beginning.But I digress. Manhattan shrink Dr. Aruna Khilanani campaigned for weeks to get Yale to publicly release her talk on race but she likely didn’t anticipate the backlash her fantasies of “unloading a revolver into the head of any white person that got in my way” would generate.For her April 6 race-hating comments to the Ivy League institution’s Child Study Center the wacko shrink was targeted across the internet including health rating websites to Twitter and TikTok.Her lecture “The Psychopathic Problem of the White Mind” not only included daydreams of gunning down white people but also dismissed the possibility that any of her targets could empathize with people of color or understand racism. She said “addressing racism assumes that white people can see and process what we are talking about.”“Like I did the world a favor.” She said in reference to shooting down white people.“We keep forgetting that directly talking about race is a waste of our breath” Khilanani stated in the incendiary speech. “We are asking a demented violent predator who thinks that they are a saint or a superhero to accept responsibility. It ain’t gonna happen.”Well Mr. Smuckmeister didn’t take this well at all being a white man himself. And the fact that Yale didn’t condemn this shrink for her statements really pissed him off.“Tear down my shithouse and refund my money” he told the Yale president.Dr. Slim: “That proves it. Those shrinks are nuttier than a fruitcake.”Dirty: “Yo Dr. Dude. Elmer never did identify with those city slicker Ivies. Good riddance!”

The latest piece of legislation passed just this afternoon is aimed at stopping the constant droning of silly people who feel it necessary to assign new values to various things.It all started back in the 1990's when an ad campaign bizarrely proclaimed that age 50 is the new 30. Seems that was all it took to set off a poo storm of silly quasi-optimistic hooey as the floodgates were opened and silly people everywhere began making proclamations.Outside the capitol building a small crowd of people wearing smiley-face buttons sang "We shall persevere". One middle-aged woman wearing a body condom held a sign saying "Soy is the new chicken and tofu is the new steak" SUE ME!!!One man identifying himself as "Just Plain John" was subdued when he first approached us but then became extremely animated once he began speaking with us. He finished with a flourish screaming "I don't know what this world is coming to man!" before finally breaking into tears and dropped to his knees sobbing.Regardless of the protests we won't the full impact of the legislation for several weeks as the dust settles and people fully process the implications. One thing is for sure however many will be slapped.Once the new law goes into effect it will amount to the second slappable offense on the books the other as you surely know is for doing the macarena.

So what’s a tennis player to do? She took out her frustration on her tennis racket pounding it into the red clay of Roland Garros turning it into an accordion or maybe a concertina. The racket didn’t look too happy.Coming prepared Coco pulled out a brand new racket from her racket bag. Okay. Reorganize. Ready set go. She went back to her game then missed one. Ouch! Oh no! Not another accordion performance.No. She remained calm and began winning points. Whew.It reminds one of the story about the farmer. He brings his bride to her new home for lunch. The mule in the yard makes a hee-haw sound. The farmer says “That’s three times.”The farmer gets up from the table takes his shotgun shoots the mule goes back into the house and sits down to finish lunch.The bride asks “Why did you do that?”The farmer says “That’s once.”So Coco took it out on her racket. So what? You know those tennis rackets don’t behave properly and have a way of letting down a tennis player. How many golfers turned pretzels out of their golf clubs? What about skiers who make firewood out of their skies? Life is life! Don’t criticize.Editor’s note: That’s once.Read more by this author:

You might say the full body condom is a style born out of necessity to suit our current social climate. While the style is certainly practical it surely gives fashion conscious hipsters an opportunity to make a bold statement while riding this late breaking trend.One of New York’s premier fashion couple were spotted in SoHo yesterday in matching body condoms. Models Ricardo Hurtz and Minx Mabley say they are both elated over this trend. “I’m still a little shaken with the virus thing so I'd say this is a Godsend! It’s a style that keeps you hip and safe so you can’t beat it!!”Hurtz was a little more subdued in his assessment: “It’s cool. But I’ve had a couple of problems getting used to it. Itr can be tough getting it on when you have a big frame like mine...and when I first put it on I had it backwards and couldn’t breathe. Luckily for me Minx was there and pulled it off before I passed out.”Mabley quickly jumped in with a laugh “He started turning blue!”.There have been no casualties due to body condoms have been reported to date.Hurtz also had some practical tips for prospective wearers. "if you stretch the top a little you can fit your lunch in there then give it a twist and its sealed and fresh for whenever you're ready to eat! The only thing is you need to remember to pack it before you get dressed and you need to get undressed to get to the food. That part is a little inconvenient but all things considered it's not so bad!

After a full investigation by various intelligence agencies the following report including the transcript of an alien conversation was just declassified and released by the CIA and FBI. It involved two aliens who landed in the Arizona desert near an isolated gas station that was closed for the night. They approached one of the gas pumps and the younger alien addressed it saying:“GREETINGS EARTHLING. We come in peace. Take us to your leader.” The gas pump of course didn’t respond.The younger alien became angry at the lack of response. The older alien said “Chill out Space Dude. The guy may not understand our language.” The younger alien ignored the warning and repeated his greeting.Again there was no response.Pissed at the pump’s haughty attitude he drew his ray gun and said once again this time with an obvious edge: “GREETINGS EARTHLING we come in peace. Take us to your leader or I will fire!” The older alien again warned his comrade saying “You probably don’t want to do that! I really think that will make him mad.”“Bullshit!” replied the cocky young alien. He aimed his weapon and opened fire. There was a huge explosion. A massive fireball roared towards him and blew the younger alien off his feet and threw him in a burnt smoking mess about 200 yards away in a cactus patch.Half an hour passed.When he finally regained consciousness he refocused his three telescopic eyes straightened his bent antenna and looked dazedly at the older wiser alien who was standing over him shaking his big green head.“What a ferocious creature!” exclaimed the young fried alien. “He damn near killed me! How did you know he was so dangerous?”The older alien leaned over placed a friendly feeler on his burnt friend’s shoulder and replied “If there’s one thing I’ve learned during my intergalactic travels you never mess with a guy who can loop his penis over his shoulder twice and then stick it in his ear.”Dr. Slim: “Youngsters should always heed the advise of their intergalactic elders.”Dirty: “Yo Dr. Dude.

Friday 11 June 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/world/153230/another-glimpse-of-the-future-group-defecation-by-2100,Another glimpse of the future: Group defecation by 2100!,Louie Martino is an American futurist that made his name during the 1980s when he envisioned the Internet and many of its practical applications.In his latest book "Visions of 2100" Martino looks at social customs and norms he expects to see in the coming years. One of the more interesting and controversial are his ideas about future pooping customs. Martino says the way we think about defecation is ripe for change."It's just a matter of common sense taking precedence over old-world thinking. Any MD or health practitioner will tell you proper defecation is essential to good health. Therefore it is something very positive."Martino thinks that we'll soon be living in a world that holds pooping in much higher esteem recognizing it as a necessary aspect of good living. "Traditionally we hold gatherings to eat and drink in celebration of various life events. A birth christening a wedding or an anniversary all customarily include a big dinner and lots of drinking."Martino tells us the shift in our thinking - like all change is a process:"In ancient settlements you'll always find a place reserved for human waste hidden away on the outskirts of the settlement. As we establish the importance of good defecation the taboo will gradually recede and defecators will no longer hide away to do their business."Eventually Martino says we'll get to a point where group defecation will be an established activity. People will reserve premier hands-free toilets which will be made available in social configurations allowing a group of friends to poop talk and laugh together all while performing a vital bodily function necessary for good health!

The news is shocking beyond anything anyone imagined!We've learned that ET spokespersons have been communicating with government representatives over the past 65 years. During that time we humans have learned among many other things some stunning news that explains why the all the secrecy was necessary.The ETs have told us that we do not in fact exist! They say our whole experience is fabricated by a simulation game popular with a certain segment of ET youth. All our experiences and memories that produce in us a belief of our own existence are actually created within the simulation by advanced ET players!This will of course will mean radical changes here - on Earth? Not sure if we can still put it that way in fact but we will get back to you on that as soon as we figure it out.Among other things learned are the following:There are over 7500 types of alien species inhabiting many thousands more planets.The first version of the humanity simulation - or "sim" was created approximately 13000 years ago. A second much more advanced version replaced it 4240 years ago Then the sim was corrupted by a renegade youth around 3100 years ago. After multiple failed attempts at repairing v2 it was scrapped a much improved and more resilient v3 was released just under 2890 years ago. That's the version we are part of today.Alien spokespeople also confirmed our sim is designed to make our universe appear desolate as though we are alone. They report that actual space is quite congested with thousands of alien species zipping about in various spiffy crafts.The source also reported that the recent calamity in our world was created when a new player took over the simulation approximately seven years ago. The player identified as Numo said he was committed to "continually shaking things up." He also added "Otherwise what's the point?"Stay tuned for more detail.

Amazon boss Jeff Bezos the world's richest arsehole announced this week that he will be taking a trip into space on the very first flight of his ship the Blue Orifice.The spaceship is named after how he likes to treat his employees. "If it's not blue by the time I've finished with them then I haven't done my job properly" he explained.Bezos made his billions by his unique management philosophy which he describes in his book "Screw Everyone". He pays his employees below the minimum wage using tax loopholes and forces Amazon suppliers to lower their prices so much that only companies that use slave labour can afford it.Now Bezos is trying to move into the space sector using a rocket built by Mexican child labourers and designed by a team of exiled North Korean graduate students who were paid in milk and internet.Bezos's grand idea is that people on the Moon will be able to order anything they want with same-day delivery. The first test flight is due to launch next month and Bezos plans to be on board."We were very pleased to hear he would be on the flight" grinned overworked rocket engineer Kim Geoff-Un. "I've been working at this company for five years where I also sleep. They work us even harder than they did in Korea."When asked if he had any worries about the safety of the rocket Geoff-Un smiled and said "Oh we've been inspecting the rocket very carefully. We're sure that Mr Bezos will have a once-in-a-lifetime trip."

However the Secret Service people have their fingers crossed and tree climbing running shoes on while Major is comfortably stretched out in front of the Oval Office door smoking a Cuban cigar.Hearing the announcement that Major was back in the White House (and without an insurrection attempt) Donald Trump argued that he too as Dean of Trump University from which Major received his degree should be allowed back into the White House.“Sorry Dean Trump” said the police officer at the White House gate “you need 270 Electoral Votes to get in. So until Arizona Texas or Georgia flips votes for you no can enter.”Newly reformed Major who traveled with the Bidens to the G7 Conference in Cornwall was described as very well behaved remaining at President Biden’s side throughout the meetings.However Major’s visit to Windsor Castle was something else; he could smell the Queen’s Corgis.Major took off seemingly watering every tree on Windsor Park grounds disappeared for a while then reappeared ready to board Air Force One.One of the Queen’s Corgis was missing.“Well maybe Major needs some graduate school at Trump University?”Read more by this author:
Monday 14 June 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/153238/cod-piece-diplomacy-why-kamala-harris-wears-pantsuits,Cod Piece Diplomacy: Why Kamala Harris Wears Pantsuits,BILLINGSGATE POST: Hillary Clinton was the first woman to recognize how powerful a symbol it was to wear a pantsuit instead of a dress when creating a political image. Nancy Poozleosi was next. When was the last time you saw either wear a dress to enhance their feminine image? Now Kamala “Chuckles” Harris has joined the pack. But she has gone one step beyond Clinton and Poozleosi.Harris has always felt that the Creator misfired when he gave men too much testosterone and too few brains. Even though she now is the second most powerful person in the World and ultimately may be number one she seethes when she is assigned second tier jobs by Sleepy Joe such as chasing around the World lying about our immigration policy.Reaching back centuries for inspiration she has taken it upon herself to create a new self; one that could compete diplomatically with her predominantly male counterparts thus the addition of the cod-piece to her wardrobe.William Shakespeare made reference to the cod-piece in MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING and MEASURE FOR MEASURE. To him it was an ostentatiously indelicate part of the male dress; never did he write about it being any more than a fool’s attempt to overcome an embarrassing lack of manhood.Intended to induce awe it is shaped to emphasize rather than disguise the genital area. With Henry VIII the cod-piece emerged as a nonverbal statement of political and economic power during the 16th century.Harris’ first international trip as VP to Guatemala and Mexico came with criticism of her for attempting to intimidate their Presidents. One reporter from CNN called her wearing a cod-piece “Cringeworthy.” In an interview with Lester Holt when asked why she hadn’t gone to the USA/Mexican border she answered: “And I haven’t been to Europe to show off my new cod-piece either...cackle cackle.”Dr. Slim: “Something smells fishy about this.”Dirty: “Yo. Dr. Dude. That’s why it would be smart to stay upwind from her.”

Hell with those chompers they could damn well cut into Fort Knox."When asked how much it is going to cost to repair the beaver damage to the wall Agent Majora replied that it won’t cost anything since the wall is in the process of being completely torn down.SIDENOTE: The mayor of Tijuana Robbie Fernandez-Finnigan told reporters that now that the US is tearing the entire wall down it will make it much easier for the south bound individuals to cross back into Mexico and return to Guatemala Honduras Nicaragua and Costa Rica.

He never had such an invite.He tried to telephone the Queen and ask why he had never been invited for a sleepover but the Palace telephone operator would not put him through. He persisted arguing that he would have his Justice Department do a background check on her and report her to MI5 or 6 whichever would be appropriate.Adding to his consternation the operator tersely replied “Go right ahead.”He then telephoned his old good friend British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and demanded to know why Boris had never arranged for a sleepover at Windsor Castle for the Trumps? And how did he ever get such a Russian-sounding Communist first name like Boris?“Invites to Windsor? Not my cup of tea. Boris? It was really Morris which was boring. Almost as bad as Donald which is the first name for a duck. I can arrange for you to be put up at a First Western Motel with a W in its name. But you have to drive up in a car."Super upset he next telephoned his really really (Sally Field are you listening) good friend Vladimir Putin and asked for a quick invite for an overnight stay in the Kremlin."It's yours Donny.

Their shots go shooting into the dark rainy skies hanging over Hampden Park.7) The Tartan Army are a bunch of piss-artists who support their team no-matter-what and give their super-stars hope that one day a miracle will happen and Braveheart is reincarnated.8) Andy Murray does not play footy!9) Rod Stewart claims he is Scottish but was born in Brentford London and the only Scottish thing on his body are his ginger-dyed nuts!10) Last not least Scots have never recovered from the slaughter at Culloden by English marauders and having Mary Queen of Scots head hanging in the Tower of London.

They were sitting on a cloud bank held up by a dozen angels who were being punished for flapping their wings too loud during quiet time. Each of them was drinking a beer.“I thought Muslims couldn’t drink alcohol” started God. “Don’t you smite your people for imbibing in alcohol?”“Oh definitely” answered Allah. “But that rule is for them and not me”.“So what brought about you taking a day off of smiting?” questioned a perplexed Allah.“I needed a break and decided to use one of my personal vacation days. Smiting people can be stressful at times. So what prompted you to take a day off?”“Virgins.” answered Allah.“Virgins? What? Are you telling me you are out of virgins?” an exasperated God replied. “I thought you were swimming in virgins the way your martyrs were killing people and sacrificing their selves in your honor”.“I only have ten of them left. I need 72 for every martyr. My distributor tells me there is a problem in the supply line”.While sitting on the angelic cloud Allah noticed that his part of the cloud was sinking rather rapidly.A surprised Allah suddenly shouted out: “Hey I am sinking! Now I am going to be lower than you! That is unacceptable!”“Well for Christ’s sake maybe if you weren’t so fat you wouldn’t sink” bellowed God. “Honestly you look like a hippo with a turban”.Before you know it both God and Allah got into a fight.First God tried to smite Allah but that did not work.

Certainly not for lepers.Leprosy is a disease which leads to nerve damage. There is a common misconception that it leads directly to the loss of limbs but that is an unfortunate side effect of sufferers not knowing when their extremities are in danger.Now the British Army is hiring lepers to create a unit of super-soldiers who feel no pain in a plan that has been branded as "reckless" "cruel" and "a spanking good idea" - that last one by Boris Johnson himself.Thirty lepers have signed up to the experimental division and have undergone training and testing on Salisbury Plain. One man known only as Geoff 35 was enjoying the experience. "I was shot three times in the leg. Didn't feel a bloody thing. It was great. Of course I can't walk now but that's all right because I'll get shore leave. Wahey! There's always lots of quim for a horny one-legged squaddie leper."Others are not so sure of the efficacy of the strategy. Military expert Hugh Waugh Wattsit-Goodfore said "This is typical of an army forced to deal with cost-cutting and a government attempting to grab attention with a cheap stunt to cheer up the jingoistic masses. It's got Boris's clumsy paw-prints all over it just like a loose posh woman."

He said he felt like he was in the effing Sahara Desert.So Mattingly decided to speak to the team owner Bruce Sherman and the team’s CEO Derek Jeter and they have come up with an idea where the players will play in shorts tank tops and open-toed cleats.Matt pointed out that they will keep two of the present uniform colors; midnight black and caliente red plus they will be adding grapefruit pink and extremist white.One bullpen pitcher upon hearing that the team will be going from long cotton ankle-length pants to shorts said that they can beat him with a catcher's mitt and he will still refuse to wear the girly-looking shorts.Another player remarked that if he is made to wear shorts then he wants to be traded either to the American League Central Division-leading Chicago White Sox or to the National League West Division-leading San Francisco Giants.

Pickstix 91 did remark that he has seen wild albino horses covered in black mud that could very easily be mistaken for zebras; especially if one has 6 or 12 Bud Lights in his belly.Meanwhile the state’s more than 6 million buffaloes or bison as they are called in Alabama are being stressed out to the max by these horrendously fast-moving fires.One noted Wyoming animal psychiatrist stated that next to mountain lions buffaloes hate stress beyond belief so she noted that many of the stressed out buffaloes may just say 'eff it' and hoof it on up to Montana.

Sunday 20 June 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/153302/are-greeks-and-italians-white,Are Greeks and Italians White?,Yes this is a real question and one seriously debated in a recent UN Sponsored scholarly convocation at the request it is said of certain influential officials of southern European ancestry who wished to be classified as persons of color (POC). It is also an aspect of a larger and more important question of whether there is an actual race of “White” people who oppress those who are not “White” and are therefore guilty of racism and called to sacrifice their positions of power and wealth as compensation. One can readily understand why Greeks and Italians among others have raised this question. The scholars who gathered to debate the matter agreed to use the new ACLU-certified Sherwin Williams scale of white-toned pigments in order to arrive at a definitive standard of “Whiteness” that would correctly identify any person of ambiguous skin tone and bring some order to the heretofore chaotic process of sorting of people into groups of oppressors and oppressed.There was general agreement also that these questions have merit as the skin colors of individuals within the same ethnic groups-- and even in the same White families-- will vary widely from the glossy stone or gem-like tones such as Oyster Pearl and Alabaster White to the soft and flat bird-derived whites of Heron Feather and Duck Duck White and in the middle the inexpensive and common tones like Nice White and Everyday White.It was further agreed that the group would need to consider the place on the “Whiteness” scale of the beige and tan hued people who while not as White as some are usually seen as White-adjacent or White-allied. Variations of this complication were also raised. An Iranian delegate for example who featured a complexion that the “Nice White” types would probably call a year-round tan said that people in Iran routinely call his skin color “sabze” derived from the Farsi word for “green” although he did not on that account alone consider himself a POC.Following these procedural matters the group addressed the main question agreeing to proceed empirically by posing themselves individually before a mirror adjacent to an enlarged set of Sherwin Williams color palettes soliciting a consensus of the views of his colleagues on which color they most closely matched; and then a binary decision was rendered that the person was White (an oppressor) or not-White (a victim of oppression).Surprisingly what seemed in the abstract so simple proved a contentious process in practice with most who objected to their classification arguing for a darker color match. Many Hispanics for example rejected the common “Tortilla Flour” match on the Sherwin Williams scale arguing that as Hispanics they were legally and by general agreement a marginalized people and therefore they could not be any shade of White. This was agreed. The one Albino delegate was also in luck as the convocation granted her a universal voice-vote exemption from Whiteness by virtue of her skin color being a rare genetic artifact. When a few Nordic representatives briefly protested that their “Snow White” coloring was also a superficial side effect of random gene mixing the assembly rejected their argument reasoning that if White skin were a purely accidental product of one’s genetic constitution—like eye color--and not an evil essence then no guilt could be attached to anyone and the world would be left without easily identified oppressors. It would be back to class warfare which seems to have mainly fizzled as an incitement for radicals. A few of those judged White from differing ethnic backgrounds but mostly Greeks complained that they could not be White oppressors because they were members of the LGBTQ+ class of marginalized people. There was a long discussion of this so-called “intersectional” complication but in the end it was agreed that as long as a person’s sexual orientation was made as obvious as skin color by the use of various rainbow-hued pastel accessories--so that no confusion would arise in the presence of POC observers--they could claim a partial exemption from “whiteness” and would not be classified as “structural” oppressors but were entitled to be judged individually on their acts and words. Upon hearing this judgment one gay wag declared that he felt that he had been consigned to White Purgatory.  While this and similar compromises were necessitated by the logic of intersectionality they pleased no one. And by the end of the conference it must be reported that the outcome was not as harmonious as expected. The sense of the meeting was that while there was no scientific basis for declaring a “White Race” there were indeed many variously tinted White races all linked by a common and harmful core of Whiteness which amounted to almost the same thing.There were resentful mutterings and dark looks as the meeting came to a close; and also an unseemly and spontaneous clustering of delegates of like skin colors. The Greeks and Italians went away bitterly disappointed that they had officially been declared “White” when all through their long history they had been Greek and Italian.  And yet a few managed to see a silver lining. Said one hopeful White delegate from the US in his closing remarks “I can’t wait for the White race to achieve radical marginalization if not total extinction.” And on a very personal note he further assured everyone that he was determined in the meantime to be demonstrably less “White” although he did not explain how he meant to achieve this goal. Nevertheless scattered applause greeted these final remarks from the podium although by that time many of the delegates had already left the room.  [Addendum: After reports of the UN meeting went public social media generated a wave of unexpected backlash. Among the many alleged outrages Sherwin Williams was compelled to apologize for not offering a “Nice Black” paint color to pair with its “Nice White.” No offense was intended the company insisted. And while there were not as many shades of black as white the company stated that it already offered many black tints including its popular Black Magic Swan Black Black of Night and the slightly oddly named Black Bean. The company promised to do better in the future drastically reducing its inventory of White shades and increasing the supply of Blacks.]
Sunday 20 June 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/153304/new-super-hero-based-on-infamous-zoom-guy-jeffrey-toobin-coming-soon,New Super-Hero Based On Infamous Zoom-Guy Jeffrey Toobin Coming Soon,The next iteration of the fantastically successful world of Marble super-heroes will feature a new addition to the pantheon the Toobinator modelled loosely on the CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin infamous for masturbating on a Zoom call with his colleagues.The studio boasts in its advance promotional materials that the creation of the Toobinator marks a new speed record in imagining and developing a big screen hero based on current news events. The Toobinator character will reportedly have two aspects appearing first in civilian guise a la Clark Kent as a comical and dumpy gnome-like character who blunders about a cable news TV set dispensing legal opinions; and then when the need arises morphing into his super-muscled hot-bod alter ego to battle Fox News and domestic terrorists.Insiders say that Toobinator costume features a generous and threatening phallus wedged into his ribbed tickle-tipped flesh-colored spandex hero suit.Rumors are that his special superhero power is the ability to make everyone in his line of sight instantly sick to their stomachs thus immobilizing them for quick dispatch. This remarkable power is apparently generated by his rapid stroking of almost any tube-shaped object including his own erect member when the need arises generating instantaneous waves of shame and disgust that lay waste among evil doers.While Marble understands that the sight of the original Toobin’s member was an occasion for both mirth and horror the superhero version they insist will be an attractive well-muscled non-GMO organ made of edible vegetable matter. The latest rumor from the set is that a corrupt Evangelical Pastor will emerge as the new Supervillain in the film. Of course as all fans of the Marble franchise know the villain always gets his just rewards in the end.Sources indicate that Mr. Toobin has agreed to serve as an advisor to the production principally for his expertise on proper techniques of public toobination.

At last! After raking in billions of dollars for colleges and universities participating in sports the US Supreme Court ruled that college athletes should also get a piece of that pie.Yes athletes received scholarships room and board meals and sometimes small change but nothing in comparison to what the schools were making off these athletes.Some college athletes didn’t even have to attend class but were given passing grades so they could continue playing sports for their college.Ever hear of a 5th year college student athlete?Or a college athlete injured in his last year of college and then dumped? And they leave campus in a wheel chair. Thanks for the memories."Don't forget to return that wheel chair."A few colleges did give small stipends to cover spending money for perks and medical care for sports related injuries. Sports related injuries? You think?“Are you sure you didn’t wrench your spinal cord and neck while studying English 101 in the dorm? It could be it wasn't during the last football game against Stanford?"The stipends were sometimes there but they weren’t nearly as gigantic or stratospheric as what professional athletes received.The term amateurism was bounced around in defense of non-payment of athletes. The NCAA March madness trucks in over a billion dollars annually because of these amateurs.And who is an amateur? Was Christopher Columbus an amateur?No one else had been to the moon. Was Neil Armstrong an amateur?If there were no college basketball players would there be a March Madness and would the NCAA collect over a billion dollars a year?No. So pay up.Read more by this author:

They come off as a pair of very spoiled We deserve better. Why? Just because. Well... And if we don't get it we'll play the race card.They were given better but they still weren’t satisfied. So they launched a blackmail scheme as the Duke of Edinburgh was dying. Harry went to his funeral but Meghan was too heavily pregnant to attend. Stage fright?Not so fast. An aid to the Sussex working late at night at Frogmore Cottage (while Meghan was allegedly heavily pregnant with Archie) saw Meghan's baby-bump prothesis on the floor of the bedroom.Gees! Holy Toledo!That must have produced a keel-over fainting spell. “Get the smelling salts. No need for hot water.

It’s this corporate herd immunity that will ensure the long-term health and well-being of our corporate citizens."However not all Americans agree that herd immunity for corporations is a positive development. "If these pharmaceutical companies are immune from lawsuits over injuries their products cause what incentive do they have to make their products safe?” posited Rich Walliston of Austin Texas.But the lack of systemic checks and balances on large corporations is one that will always be raised by those who for whatever mental or emotional deficiency find it impossible to trust the "system” says Fauci.“There will always be those who put a cynical negative spin on the protections we put in place for the businesses that profit off our illnesses" said the NAIAD Director. "Unfortunately we don’t have a a vaccine for that just yet." He chuckled and added "We’re working on it though.”
Tuesday 22 June 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/153314/electron-admits-to-being-a-bit-negative,Electron Admits to Being a Bit Negative,Despite being encouraged to feel good about his essential role in the makeup of matter an election named Eli admitted to being a bit negative.“I really admire my comrade protons who have such a positive attitude” said Eli. “And I greatly respect the equanimity of the neutrons I know. But what can I say? I've got a nanobit of blackness at my core - an existential angst if you will. It’s just who I am.”Part of what initially rocked his world in the 1920s says Eli were the discoveries of quantum mechanics which revealed that his own place on the universe could not be pinpointed at any given location at any given point in time prompting the self-reflective electron to question his very existence. Adding to the trauma recounted Eli during one particularly cruel physics experiment he witnessed the death of his friend Schrodinger’s cat. The experience has never left him says Eli. "I’m against animal experimentation on all levels" he avowed. "Even theoretical."And so regardless of the unmitigated cheerfulness of the other atomic particles in his immediate vicinity Eli says that he will continue to be his authentic self negativity and all.“I can’t be something I’m not” he said. “And not is what I’ve got. In fact it’s all I’ve got. Take it or leave it.”

But not so fast. An account known as Eyes Open tweeted: “Dog comms? Seem a few around at the mo!!!”“Comms” are formally known as secret messages that can be decoded by QAnon supporters. Dog comms have been around for a long time.James Comey lost his rescue dog in 2018 and tweeted at the time: “Because he was a rescue we didn’t know his age. He was a friend to an entire big family as only a dog can be. Goodbye old soul.”The description of “an entire big family” was found very cryptic by QAnon believers. Because of the relationship to George H.W. Bush’s code name which had been Timberwolf some QAnoners speculated that Bush’s death was connected to Comey’s announcement and that the former FBI Director was aware of Bush’s death before the family announced his passing; leaving some to believe he was taken out by the Deep State.The death of Champ they speculate may be code for something else possibly having to do with Donald Trump who has no dog to speak for him.Dr. Slim: “Lassie died on June 18 1958. Juneteenth is celebrated on June 19. Why couldn’t Lassie have lasted one more day?”Dirty: “Yo Doctor. Beyond my pay grade. Only a QAnon sage could decrypt that code.”

Spoofer Now 91 Rebuffed by Miss America 92,Atlantic City New Jersey. Woof Bluster reporting with a SINful report for Spoof International News. Word has reached the HQ for the Miss America Pageant that a contestant in the pageant 70 years ago has upheld her Miss America contract by refusing to move in unmarried with a long-time friend and former elementary school classmate.The Miss American contestant who shall remained unidentified to protect her innocence was propositioned by the same Spoof writer who a month ago was dumped a second time by the same girl who had dumped him six decades earlier. See "Spoof Writer 90 dumped twice by same girl 65 years apart."While initially agreeing to share the Spoofer's home her lawyers called attention to a contract clause that prohibits contestants from engaging in situations that imitate marriage. Sharing a home with a male companion would clearly violate the rule. Such a violation would prevent her from being crowned Miss America for 1950 should the actual Miss America belatedly engage in any activity that would remove her crown.Although her eight children had given their consent with the sole warning of "Don't get pregnant" and the Spoofer's six kids had likewise agreed the domestic relationship is now in serious question. She had already arranged for several organ transplants to make procreation possible and he had placed an irrevocable order for those little yellow and blue pills to be delivered discreetly packaged to his rear door. At 91? Well if Clint Eastwood can do itwhy not a Spoofer?The two have agreed to continue their constant stream of email - neither can text zoom or do anything electronic that wasn't there in the 20th century. Both are disappointed that it didn't work out since they hadn't seen each other since 1947.

The shocking question about his suspension is: What took the New York Supreme Court so long to act? And how did the Court manage to narrow down his lies to the 2020 election?Not to offend or be critical of the New York Supreme Court. Oh no.While also not disparaging the parental skills of his parents or that he was a member of the Catholic Church and a choir boy as well but the guy has been consistently telling falsehoods about everything from New Yorkers not getting cancer from the 9/11 debris to Hunter Biden receiving cash payments from a Ukrainian gas company.“I’ve got the proof right here.”But the ruling by the Court made it clear that the disciplinary action taken was for the false claims he made while representing Donald Trump. Not exactly like getting into trouble for defending Joan of Arc.Not that Trump will ever be burned at the stake.Although Netflix could sell tickets.So Rudy is in trouble. And he has that monthly alimony bill of $42000 he has to pay to his 3rd wife. It would have been cheaper to stay married. Give her $4000 a month for groceries. He could have done the cooking and house cleaning. He was obviously already coloring his own hair.But it was all because of Trump. Did Rudy fly too close to the sun? There's the idea of fire again.Read more by this author:

It's a 'Domino Effect!' (Good that one!). The fabulous Bratwurst has really failed to take over the world in recent times we wonder why? German soggy Frankfurters once topped the global food charts after being adopted by the USA in their hot dogs with sauerkraut and French mustard leaving the poor old bratwurst to remain in inedible forms including a Berliner favourite sprinkled with curry powder imported from India but they could not win a sausage either!As for fish and chips England's soggy vinegar ridden favourite wrapped in despicable Brit tabloids an idiosyncratic dish made these days by ex-Chinese launderette entrepreneurs who saw the end coming after shrinking Levi jeans and decided to take over failing English run fish and chip shops who believed in everything the tabloids writ after Maggie Thatcher promised them the earth and ended up with Tony Blair instead the little Devil!Footy has now reincarnated the passion and rivalry for these ancient dishes. However chauvinistic lovers of a croissant baguette or a wicked stinky slice of camembert are secretly laughing behind a cup of Cafe au Lait whilst not getting their lips wet qui qui.It seems until either a German Bratwurst or soggy heap of UK Cod and Chips Made in China pops out of the deep fry pan first UK tabloids before being soaked in vinegar will make sure English citizens are brainwashed into believing Fish and Chips will certainly exit first leaving the Bratwurst to fry into a blitzed-crisp!For further info re cheap foods send this post to Lidl and please do not mention the war!

From the end of June there will be a ban on British sausages being imported there.Thanks to Boris Johnson's Northern Ireland protocol there is now a customs borders down the Irish Sea separating the province from the rest of the UK. This was an agreed condition of Johnson's so called "oven-ready deal" which he rushed through to "get Brexit done". As the grace period ends the full set of import rules is about to be imposed.Geoff Butcher is a sausage exporter based in Cumbria who will be badly affected. "Normally we send a couple of truckloads full of sausages every week to Belfast but that will have to end. I feel sorry for my customers. They'll have to buy inferior European sausages instead. They have a much lower rusk content and some of them don't contain any sawdust at all."There was anger in Northern Ireland. Unionist politician Ian Banger raged "We doin't march through the center of Belfast for fun ye knoi. We do it for oir sausages. They're part of oir oidentity. Oi doin't knoi what's going on in Boris's head telling us one thing and then doing another. His head must be full of mash and gravy."Military expert Major Des Aster considered the possibilities of a sausage war. "I remember in the thirty years war - no the war thirty years ago. The Golf War I think. Jimmy Tarbuck never forgave me for beating him at the eighteenth hole."There were a lot of sausages in that conflict. I felt sorry for them all packed up and sent off to the front line. One poor chap got burned to a crisp - it was a nasty business. We had to feed him to the dogs."It's not like the sausages you see nowadays lazing around on the supermarket shelves like they own the place. No doubt being paid for by our benefits. How much money does a sausage really need to live off? They're all scroungers the lot of them. I ate one the other week it tasted like it didn't even need Universal Credit."It's time they brought back National Sausage I mean Service. Get those lazy bags of meat into action drill them daily. That'll give them some backbone. Although I hear that a lot of sausages contain pieces of backbone. Well it's all edible isn't it."

'Yes I am quite attractive to the opposite sex and I am sure if I worked in a high profile job my incompetence really would get me all of the opportunities I need.'Barry has been furloughed for months.

When pressed as to why he felt that way R.G. replied because old Trumpapalooza told Sean Hannity that he was 52% zombie and 34% sea monster.The ping-pong eye-balled disgraced former mayor of the Bronx also blames the decision on baseless rumors that one of his ancestors Elvira Gertrude Giuliani was a Salem witch and so therefore he was targeted in a recent Central Park witch hunt.Meanwhile Trump was asked for his thoughts on Giuliani and he commented that he does not know Rudy Giuliani has never met him and that he wouldn't know him from Russian President Vlady Putin.

Saturday 26 June 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/153351/stop-the-squeal,Stop The Squeal!,A new 'Stop The Squeal' movement has started up.This document is being circulated to put an end to the endless squealing of certain groups of an extreme right wing flavor that insist that the 2020 was stolen. It is now time to end this right-winged fit of whining.The election was lost fair and square by all accounts except for a handful of individuals who also believe that Elvis is still alive and that the moon is made of green cheese. Add to that the even more extreme people (if they are still within the definition of being 'people' that is) who fervently complain that the Jews were never persecuted in WWII or that the moon landings never took place or that the Mets never really won the 1969 World Series.They endless braying about Donald Jerk Trump being the true winner are getting as tedious as Amelia Earhart sighting in the South Pacific. HE LOST!!!!! GET OVER IT!! If you insist on going on with this charade you could say by the same logic that Trump stole the election away from Hillary who had the majority of the popular vote. Yes it is the same thing! Except that she was gracious enough to concede. Trump doesn't even know what being gracious is; although he would probably forthrightly say that he is the most gracious person who ever lived. The Electoral College gave Trump the Presidency. There was a lot of complaints about this rising from the left but as you can see Trump still got the throne. The Democrats bemoaned it but they leg go eventually and did not resort to other tactics like having temper tantrums starting profitable Stop The Steal fund-drives complaining unendingly about the unfairness of it and making a martyr of the last man on earth one should consider a poor sacrificial thing to an evil force when he himself is an evil force.We here at Stop The Squeal are dedicated to putting an end to the ceaseless lunacy surrounding the end result of the 2020 elections once and for all. We have a number of solutions to that end. One would be fitting anti-masker Marjorie Taylor Greene with a full face iron mask that would be welded on the same way as happened to the prisoner in the Alexandre Dumas novel The Man in The Iron Mask. Then there would be the hosing down of any Stop The Steal rallies with ice cold water that might shock the recipients back into some form of sanity. Another would be banning Herr Trump to his Mar-A-Lago mansion without any Internet privileges.Other options include secretly attaching a hidden micro camera onto the clothes or body of fanatic 'stealers' that would relay to the world just how pathetic and minimal their every day lives were when they are not in the public eye. By the same means mini sensors that can detect erratic brain waves from the individual could be tied into a network system to let viewers monitor just when they are having one of their psychotic episodes.If these methods prove unsuccessful more extreme methods might have to be employed. We have already been in contact with a Jewish space laser firm about possible annihilations.

So he lingers and lingers giving the same old speech pretending to be current but flopping around like a tortilla on a record player with some of his audience reciting his punchlines along with him.A casino in Vegas called asking whether he was interested in being an opening act for Celine Dion or one of the Osmond kids. Trump believes he’s the main attraction and not an opening act.They even offered to give him the old top floor Howard Hughes suite with the private elevator and all the buffet he could eat.Finally they said that part of his opening act performance would close with a Noble Peace Prize nightly presentation.Unfortunately that was supposed to be an inside joke but now Trump is seriously considering it.Writing his own script he believed he could begin his performance with stories about his early childhood sent to a military school when in the second grade skip to hiring mafia lawyer Harry Cohn as his personal attorney followed by Rudolph Giuliani the White House years Air Force One meeting the Queen finish with the stolen 2020 election and then close with the nightly presentation of a Noble Peace Prize.Yawn.“It ain’t Broadway doll. It’s Vegas. But it’ll work. Besides it'll keep Trump off the campaign trail.”Maybe his should be the nightly closing act?Read more by this author:

Tradition calls for giving the face of the stone a wee peck but I've seen tourists smooching it like a hormone-crazed teenager on Saturday night."Be that as it may we've instituted the precaution of washing down the stone with fine Irish whiskey after each visitor."It may seem like a waste of perfectly good Jame-o but at least the janitor on duty gets to savour the aroma."Mind though I've had to warn that O'Brien if I catch him drinking from his bucket again he's fired!"Meanwhile at Cork University Hospital Dr. Maura O'Reilly told assembled reporters:"It's easy to recognize patients from the Blarney outbreak. They might be turning blue from the lack of oxygen but they seem hell-bent on using their last dying breaths to launch into some grandiloquent lilting discourse on the most random of topics."My staff have taken to intubating these patients pre-emptively as there doesn't appear to be any other way to get them to shut up."

Although the report does not completely repudiate theories of otherworldly visitations it does attempt to answer some questions.Although there is no evidence that any of the episodes involve secret U.S. weapons programs unknown technology from Russia or China or extraterrestrial visitations it does not rule out the possibility that some of the sightings may have been of renegade anvils especially the ACME MARK IV used by the Road Runner to throttle Wile E Coyote in hundreds of episodes.Interestingly there have been countless reports by Navy pilots of unworldly visual encounters with triangular objects that can hover for periods of time then seemingly dart in any direction at speeds incomprehensible to earthlings. Although the government still has no explanation for this Wile E Coyote has repeatedly been bombarded by objects that fit this description.Although the ACME MARK IV demonstrates technological capabilities that are unknown to the United States the fact that these anvils can accelerate without observable propulsion cannot be denied.To the casual observer too little data exists to draw a conclusion about many of the episodes. But both scientific experts and enthusiastic amateurs have advanced explanations ranging from the mundane to the otherworldly and the report did little to substantiate or dismiss their theories.Government officials were reluctant to acknowledge the potential that the phenomena could be as simple as a hovering anvil; a signal of how unlikely they view that explanation.On the other hand the report offers no evidence of a more believable theory.Dr. Slim: “Sounds like just another government coverup.”Dirty: “Yo Doctor. If you can’t believe your government who can you believe?”

But what can citizens use as an excuse except to say "Donald Trump was here! Scrambled eggs and all."Could he have been Rosemary'sBaby?No. That was just a fictional Roman Polansky film. Although Trump was true fiction while working on television.Trump was a scripted television talk show host and enough voters believed in the script he memorized. On his talk show he sounded profound decisive smart having the executive ability and vocabulary beyond these them and those. The voters bought it.In reality he was an empty box. He was told what to say where to look and what to decide.Along with viewers Donald Trump began to believe in his written script. "I'm a genius!"If Trump can manage to delay criminal proceedings past the election and win then he'll be able to appoint his own Attorney General who would stall stop and quash any indictment.Like what Attorney General Bill Barr was able to do.Without his very own Attorney General it sounds like a go straight to a jail sentence.About buying Trump 2024 inauguration tickets?That clock is ticking.Read more by this author:

Wants To Buy The Alamo and Turn It Into a Luxurious Historical Bed & Breakfast,NEW YORK CITY – (Satire News) – The largest corporation in the world Bezos-Musk Inc. has just announced that it is currently in negotiations with The Alamo Coalition Alliance in an effort to purchase the historical Texas mission located in downtown San Antonio.The elderly building was the sight of the infamous Battle of The Alamo of 1836 which pitted Davy Crockett Jim Bowie William Barrett Travis and 184 volunteers against General Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana's army of 43000 soldiers.General Santa Ana's army consisted of the following divisions: The 71st Tabasco Infantry The 7th Chihuahua Cavalry 169th Aguascalientes Artillery The 13th Baja California Dragoons The 101st Oaxacan Navy The 8th Sinaloa Marching Band and The 2nd Quintana Roo Catering Service.Jeffy and Ely as President Biden refers to them have come up with the idea of buying the Alamo from the ACA and pouring $17.8 million into it and turning it into the most elegantly luxurious bed and breakfast in America.The building which was originally built in 1391 by a constructing firm from Honduras has recently shown advanced signs of serious deterioration.A building inspector from nearby Alamo Heights Myron Saltmalt stated that some of the mission’s windows are showing adobe cracks which he blames on pesky rollie pollies also known as pill bugs.Saltmalt noted in his 73-page report that the attic has bats grackles carpenter ants woodpeckers and woodchucks.He then pointed out that the basement has two-inches of standing water along with guppies sardines and even a few tuna fish.The 74-year-old inspector also revealed that all of the sinks and toilets will have to be sealed off with yellow crime tape.SIDENOTE: Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk had lunch with Tapioca Swizzle of Tittle Tattle Tonight at a local Whataburger and they informed her that the bed and breakfast luxury suites will rent for $3000 a day.
Monday 28 June 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/sport/153366/nba-commits-to-new-diversity-goals-will-add-more-white-hispanic-and-asian-players,NBA Commits to New Diversity Goals Will Add More White Hispanic and Asian Players,Many have observed that professional sports have lagged behind the current commitment to diversify government educational and corporate institutions.The National Hockey League for example is well known for its failure to recruit black players with more than 90% of its players being White. And while everyone agrees that more needs to be done it is the National Basketball Association that has finally moved beyond talking points with a bold program of reform.In a blockbuster announcement last week the NBA promised to lead the way toward a truly diverse future by pledging to make all NBA teams demographically “look like America.”As one owner who wished to remain anonymous said "The fact that the league is 72% Black and skews very very Young is a problem. How can we ask the NHL and baseball to do better if we don’t show the way by limiting Black players to no more than 13% of each team’s roster and adding more White Hispanic and Asian players men as well women and maybe a Senior citizen or two?”“Bulls..t!” shouted ESPN’s volcanic sports commentator  Stephen Smith in a reaction typical of basketball aficionados. “This is f..king ridiculous! Who the hell is gonna watch a bunch of pale White elderly dwarves escort a basketball up and down the court? WTF? We gonna have Macy's Parade fast breaks? Wheelchairs and diaper bags on the sideline? Nobody’s gonna watch this shit!...Sure you got a few good White players but you gonna bench LeBron and watch Jeffrey Toobin try to dunk off a ladder with one hand down his shorts?” Well maybe I'd watch that" Smith conceded sourly.In the face of the fan firestorm that greeted the NBA’s announcement of their new diversity goals league officials reacted by saying that just because rosters would be made to reflect the new diversity targets it didn’t mean that the new White players would actually see much court time. “We know very well that White guys can’t jump. And most of them can’t dribble or shoot either. So on the court what you see now which is that 72% of players are black will stay the same at least for the time being. But to meet our diversity targets we have calculated that we will need to expand the average NBA team bench from the current 13 players to around 83. It’s a real commitment. But we ought to do it if we mean what we say about diversity.”Conservative media made the most of this fracas among the woke. Sean Hannity of Fox News was among the media talking heads turning the left’s words back on them ironically suggesting that any alleged deficit of basketball skills among Whites must be structural since everyone knows that people are equal in every way. If given the proper opportunities as many Whites as Blacks would excel at basketball and the reverse would be true in hockey Hannity claimed tongue firmly in cheek.To those who complained that the quality of the game would suffer in the meantime if players were not drafted on the basis of their actual skills and abilities but by skin color in order to rectify past discrimination Hannity said “You want to see slam dunks by five-foot tall White guys just lower the net. Besides who watches basketball anyway? Gotta cut this segment short now. I’m on my way to a hockey game.”In a related story the AP reports that Chinese authorities have applauded the new NBA commitment and promised to support the effort if the NBA would agree to slightly amend its diversity template to reflect the more relevant global racial balance which would imply the addition of fifty or so Chinese nationals to each team as Asians constitute about 60% of the world’s population.The NBA has not replied to a request for comment.

Kamala Harris and Begs Her To Please Convince President Biden To Give Him a Pardon,WASHINGTON D.C. – (Satire News) – Boom Boom News has learned from a close friend of DJT that he called up V.P. Harris and he literally begged her to please please please talk to President Biden and ask him to issue him a full presidential pardon so he doesn’t end up having to go to prison and having to wear to hideously ugly orange prisoners jumpsuits.BBN’s Hacienda Fiddle said that the friend revealed that he has known Trump for 27 years and that was the first time he has actually seen him cry; he did note that the tears were black due to the eye-liner the Trumpster has for some unknown reason started wearing lately.The vice-president reportedly called up President Biden as soon as she hung up and the two were said to have had one enormously huge belly laugh.In fact one of the White House maids overheard the vice-president tell the president that she hasn’t laughed so hard since she was a little girl and she would watch "The Three Stooges" on TV.She then divulged that she was laughing so hard at the fact that Trump was begging like a little bitch that she came very close to peeing in her expensive designer Donatella Versace pant suit.In a Related Story.

Tuesday 29 June 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/153378/the-troubling--new-normal--addiction-freedom-porn,The Troubling “New Normal” Addiction: Freedom Porn,In the midst of continuing lockdowns vaccine passports and widespread censorship the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has reported a troubling new addiction on the rise among male-identifying neoliberals: a media genre sensationalizing extreme independence of thought and action also known as “freedom porn.”One self-acknowledged freedom porn addict Charles B. of Cambridge Massachusetts did his best to explain the obsession. "I truly believe there’s no greater service I can offer humanity than to subjugate my own critical thinking and personal autonomy to the whim of unelected health officials politicians and pharmaceutical executives. But sometimes late at night when my wife’s fast asleep I’ll sneak into the bathroom and watch a YouTube video of men acting like men and making hard – really hard – decisions according to their own conscience and values. And I fantasize about what it might be like to actually think for myself.”The avowedly politically correct Joe Biden supporter hastened to emphasize "Don't get me wrong. I’d never actually do it. But it’s intoxicating to imagine.”Another to find himself in the throes of freedom porn addiction is Thad H. of Los Angeles California whose favorite video features a large-breasted women whispering seductively into the ear of a steely-jawed gravelly-voiced man who responds “Sorry I can’t hear you over the sound of my freedom." “The woman gets me going" said Thad with a shamefaced smile. "But it’s the dude who finishes me off.”And the top-rated freedom porn star of all time? The answer might come as a surprise to some: former United States senator and libertarian Ron Paul.“I loved him in his younger days preaching about integrity and liberty and personal responsibility” said Anderson F. of Harford Connecticut. “But nothing can compare to hearing him these days going off on Fauci and the Federal Reserve. Honestly it's pretty much spoiled me for ordinary run-of-the-mill political stimulation.”Fortunately says NIAID Director Dr. Anthony Fauci there is a path out for those struggling with freedom porn addiction: vaccination preferably of the mandatory kind. “If the first shot doesn’t fully resolve the independence issue the second or third one most likely will” he said. “The main thing is to get in the physical habit of baring your arm for untested medical interventions. The mental evolution will follow.”

Tuesday 29 June 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/uk/153372/london-man-caged-for-shouting-at-burglar,London man caged for shouting at burglar,A London man was given two consecutive life sentences at The Old Bailey yesterday after being found guilty of shouting loudly at a burglar who had broken into his home in the early hours of the morning in March 2021.Toby Dell a retired forklift truck engineer from Whitechapel in East London with no previous convictions wept in the dock as the sentence was handed down by Mr Justice Mockery who recommended that he should serve the full life term with no prospect of parole.In his summing-up Justice Mockery stated: "Society in general and the criminal fraternity in particular deserves a long rest from your activities. You are quite clearly a ruthless and callous man who is prepared to go to any lengths to inflict suffering and distress on anyone you perceive as a threat to your property or wife and children".Dell 68 had been woken by a noise at his terraced council home and after arming himself with a rolled-up copy of The East London Gazette had gone downstairs to investigate when he saw James "Jimmy The Cat" Biggs a convicted house breaker with over 200 previous convictions for petty theft housebreaking and assault rifling through his sideboard.Dell had then called out in a loud agitated voice: "Oi what do you think you're doing? Get out!" whereupon Biggs pistol-whipped Dell to the ground fracturing his skull before making his escape through a window that he'd earlier smashed to gain entry.He was later found drinking heavily in a nearby public house by police officers who topped up his pint and gave him a packet of 20 Senior Service.The officer on the scene PC Gonemad stated "Mr Biggs was in an absolutely shocking condition when I spotted him in the public bar of The Bunch Of Grapes public house in Stepney. He looked visibly drunk and was very unsteady on his feet. Clearly the trauma of being shouted at by Dell that night had taken a terrible toll on him.Myself and fellow officer WPC Philbert bought him a fresh pint and gave him a pack of 20 cigarettes to steady his nerves. He then broke down and told us of the terrible events of that evening."We immediately called for backup and along with a number of officers in full riot gear we smashed our way into Dell's house where we found him quite blatantly lying unconscious on the kitchen floor in a pool of blood with a gaping head wound as if he didn't have a care in the world. It was chilling to witness to be perfectly honest".Dell's wife and children were in hiding at a secret address last night to avoid being targeted by furious local vigilante groups.

We had customers begging for sausages they couldn't understand why we didn't have any here in Northern Ireland when in England and Scotland and Wales they had plenty. I told them it was Boris's fault but they wouldn't stop."The hell is now at an end for three months at least. The current conditions for sausage trade between Britain and Northern Ireland have been extended until the end of September. But then what.The Prime Minister had no answer "Bah! Then we'll ask for another three months. You'll see."

Facebook’s recent invitation to its users to expose and inform on one another for alleged “extremist” views proves the point.Taking a page from Germany’s National Socialist Party Hitler Youth Facebook is now warning users that if they have been exposed to “extremist content” or if they “know someone who is becoming an extremist” they should immediately “get help” by exposing that person to Facebook and the NSA’s Extremism Task Force.The young cadres at Facebook have specifically modeled this initiative on the 1933 Nazi law “Against Malicious Attacks against the Government” which reads in part “Whoever purposely makes or circulates a statement of a factual nature which is untrue or grossly exaggerated or which may seriously harm the welfare of the …state or the reputation of the National government or of a state government or of parties or organizations supporting these governments is to be punished…with imprisonment of up to two years or…penal servitude.”While Facebook admits that it currently lacks space to house or imprison extremists it is reportedly exploring solutions with interested progressive NGO’s. Rumors have circulated that the currently depopulated city of Portland Oregon may be a candidate for the first of the new re-education camps for domestic extremists exposed by the new Facebook program. Antifa has volunteered to administer the camps.AP reports that Mr. Zuckerburg has also flown to the northwest of China to study the new planned communities being built there for the Uighurs who--according to blue-checked Twitter accounts--are grateful that their own extremists have been extracted and put to work building Chinese socialism.Said Zuck “China is showing us the way forward. Real facts and true truths are too important to be left to amateurs conservatives and all those who write from flawed and antiquated political perspectives. There needs to be more optimizing of national messaging in the interest of public safety and progress and we plan to be a big part of that effort.”Asked by a Fox News reporter as he disembarked from his private jet how Facebook defines extremism the Facebook CEO said thoughtfully “Well extremism is a lot like obscenity; hard to define but we know it when we see it. You’ll just have to trust us on that.”“Sure. Why wouldn’t we trust a guy who built a misogynistic coed face-ranking scheme in his dorm and turned it into a gazillion-dollar vehicle for speech suppression?” the reported shouted angrily as Zuck signaled to his security detail that he felt unsafe at the tone of these questions."That was really extreme and made me feel very unsafe" Zuck declared sadly as his security detail took photos of the reporter and called for backup.[The Editors: please note that this article has been cleared in advance with Facebook’s Committee to Repress Extremist Expression in Publishing (CREEP).]

However calling a plumber to do the job is even more harrowing after they send their invoice!It is a common fact that many leaking taps have caused heart-attacks suicide and nervous breakdowns when the plumber's invoice flutters through the letter box which includes mileage hourly rates for plumber and his mate and over the top material costs!So this particular OAP residing in a terraced house built in 1949 decided to do a DIY job on his leaking tap to save having a heart attack. He removed the dripping tap attached under the sink without problems apart from his missus having to heave him up onto his feet.However replacing the old tap with a new one was rather more complicated and time consuming. Once on the floor and under the sink everything was going hunky-dory until he had to get up to see if the tap was aligned correctly.Years of playing footy tennis hot-doggy-sex on his knees (you wish!) and running marathons had left his knees in a rather shoddy shape. So the simple job of replacing his leaking tap transformed into a major exercise in fainting getting dizzy cracking of knees and lying distraught on the bog floor like a stranded beached blue-whale!Luckily his missus was still around as she heard him scream for help! She called an ambulance! They managed to drag him off the floor and into the ambulance without further damage to his back and knees.A plumbing company was informed and they immediately sent a young plumber round to install the new tap. After receiving the plumber's bill the OAP was transferred to Intensive Care after his heart went into attack mode!He is now in rehab. However his missus is over-the-moon after the leaking dripping bog tap was repaired by a trained young handy-man and not a 'Jurassic' tight-as-a-duck's-arse DIY amateur with dodgy knees.Moral of this story: "No more 'knees up Mother Brown's at Christmas!"

But can I borrow your teeth?” While campaigning in a rural area of West Virginia in 2019 Joe Biden was unable to keep his chain of thought as he read from his Teleprompter. There was an elderly lady in the front row who had her dentures out and was clacking them in her hand while Biden was trying to speak.Motioning to his son Hunter who was sitting near the trouble maker he pointed his finger at the woman and indicated to his son that he should grab the clacking chicklets from the lady so he could finish his speech.BAD IDEA!Olga Gulaschi won the woman’s shot put competition in the 1952 Olympic Games in Helsinki while competing for Bulgaria. That was before testing was done. Olga was proud of her five o’clock shadow. Being naturally strong. she lived on a farm and was able to lift a calf over her head everyday until it weighed 960 pounds. To practice for the shot put she used to throw her dwarf brother against a stack of hay bales after school each day.After the Cold War was over she immigrated to the United States settling in Cabin Creek West Virginia. Incidentally that was where NBA legend Jerry West grew up. That is why West earned the moniker “The Geek from Cabin Creek.”But I digress.Hunter didn’t know what hit him. Later according to the Cabin Creek Gazette and Bugle he claimed it was a sucker punch.Dr. Slim: “Walk me through this: Hunter was coldcocked by a ninety year old Bulgarian shot putter?”Dirty: “Yo Doctor. Hunter said he wanted a rematch when Olga turned 100.”

A pungent odour then reaches the nostrils of purchasers of this rather odd idiosyncratic product normally only tolerated by heathen Vikings with smelly armpits and fishy feet.Danish cheese stinks! Havarti Esrom Danbo etc is about to wreak havoc in UK fridges! Hence the decision to withdraw from a 'block' which has to tolerate the stench because Danish stinky cheeses are a product of the 'Block' and cannot be obliterated like bottles of revolting Marmite Made in UK.Thousands of Viking Danish footy fans are about to invade the sacred city of Londinium demanding that their armpits and feet are allowed to stink for the time of the invasion and their beloved cheeses are available in supermarkets all over the city. Euro multis Lidl and Aldi being rather cheap and not nasty but nearly have accommodated their Danish brethren's demands and ordered tons of Danish cheese for the duration of the invasion.Brit lovers of Danish stinking cheese are 'over the moon' that they can now purchase as much of the stinking stuff as they desire sadly their children are not because the fridge pongs!The Danish invasion will only last for a few days the pungent odours of Viking sweaty armpits bad-breath and fishy feet will disappear but the pungent smell of Danish cheeses left in UK fridges will remain for slightly longer unfortunately.However there is a 'Silver lining to every Dark Cloud' floating across this rather weird island stuck in the North Sea; non-stinking genetically manipulated cheeses which taste like plastic wrapped in plastic are about to invade the UK from 'Big Brother' in the mighty USA. A trade deal that was signed between two morons before one was taken to the cleaners by the IRS and the other claiming the Delta Variant was imported by hooligan Danish Vikings getting their bacon and certainly not returning pilgrimage Indians because he needs their vote in the next UK election!

It was another world record.While Nathan’s benefits from the publicity generated by the annual eating contest the competition has come under attack once again by left wing groups appalled at the stupefying spectacle of stomach-turning gluttony in a world still afflicted by hunger. Critics also wondered out loud why anyone would actually choose to watch an event where the chief suspense was achieved by watching contestants fend off the gag reflex.Marxist economists of course blamed the contest on the capitalist system accusing it of producing a surfeit of artery clogging meat products whose only purpose was to keep the proletariat fat and satiated. As Marx wrote in Das Kapital “Hot dogs are the opiate of the people.” According to physicians cited by the anti-meat organization PETA which like most progressive lobbies wants to protect ignorant people from harming themselves in eating his way to victory Mr. Chestnut consumed a prodigious 22000 calories worth of dogs and buns—about 10 days’ worth of the normal average daily requirement for men—in less than 10 minutes. But to burn off the same number of calories (avoiding any weight gain) would take far longer than 10 minutes.By way of example doctors calculated that Mr. Chestnut would need to run about 200 miles to consume 22000 calories. Or he might engage in vigorous coitus for 50 hours followed immediately by a 50 mile run. Obese Americans—the next oppressed group vying for recognition of their victim status--condemned this metabolic inequity and wondered if someone had tampered with their fat cells. Asked by a snide PETA flack to comment on the adverse health consequences of competitive gluttony Mr. Chestnut was defiant. “I just throw up for three or four hours straight and that burns it all off. Puking is a pretty good work out; try heaving up 16 pounds of meat and nearly 10 pounds of bread” he challenged laughing at the expressions of disgust and contempt from reporters.“Be sure to watch again next year you PETA bitches” Chestnut shouted gleefully as the hostile group backed away. “Gonna eat 77 dogs 77 buns and a few stray cats.”

The decision by a conservative dominated Trump appointed court sent shock waves through every local National Rifle Associaiton club across America.The case involved a North Dakota law that limited the size of bows and the number of arrows that would be allowed on the Wikipoo Indian reservation in that state. Tribe members argued that their right to bear arms under the Second Amendment had been infringed by the state law and appealed to the Supreme Court.The six ultra conservative justices were joined by all three liberals in the opinion written by Clarence Thomas. The decision was based on the well-established conservative view of "original intent" by which the constitution is interpreted in light of what the founders had in mind at the time it was written.Thomas noted that General George Washington had written a memorandum in which he stipulated that recruits would bring their own muskets powder and bullets when they joined the Continental Army. "The General's memo clearly indicated that the only arms the Founders had in mind was the musket. Original intent must apply and all other "arms" that exist today are not covered by the amendment." There was no dissenting opinionOutside of their chambers most of the six conservative justices were reluctant to say anything further about the decision but Chief Justice Roberts indicated that the decision was hard for most of the conservatives "but we had to remain true to our belief in original intent."NRA has issued a statement regretting that Bernie Sanders had not been elected president because Sanders a Second Amendment leftist would have appointed pro-gun lawyers to the Court.The Supreme Court Washington D.

In the meantime it seemed worthwhile to purge the most egregious uses of un-woke language and enforce the ban through antiseptic career doxing well intentioned personal harassment and for the recalcitrant the physical ministrations of largely peaceful Antifa arsonists.Strikingly most of the banned words were heard only yesterday in casual conversation. “Man” and “woman” for example are now correctly seen as referring to hopelessly outmoded and erroneous ideas of gender distinctions. Brandeis suggests that in place of “man” we say “male identifying human” or “dudist. For “woman” there is “female identifying person” and “femdudist” as well as the traditional rap terms “bitch” and “ho” which are still correct at least in musical contexts.While nouns got off lightly the list goes bad-ass on adjectives including those like “crazy” and “lame” that imply some defect or variation from a mythical “norm” (another banned-ass word!). One now refers to a whacky idea by saying “that’s bananas” which is not actually a word but a whole sentence. It is worth noting that the authors are careful to insist that bananas themselves are probably not “bananas” and that no offense to this popular fruit was intended. On the other hand “lame” can thankfully for those struggling with so much linguistic change still be used in non-intellectual contexts for example when it is meant specifically to describe physically impaired persons such as “cripples” “limpers” “gimps” “crutchcreepers” and “tripods” (four legged cripples).For many readers of the list the biggest surprise was the inclusion of the word “picnic” on the list as most people had formerly understood that word to be safe and not at all offensive. Alas the authors discovered that “picnic” has an obscure history that led after some deep-ass scholarship to the even more obscure report that feasts of hot dogs hamburgers potato salad and toasted marshmallows were apparently an entertainment staple served at murderous lynchings.In an end-note to the list and in a nod to the new ways of speaking that will likely appear to future generations as obscure as the racist word “picnic” the authors approved of the wide-spread usage of the “hyphen ass” intensifier as in a “hard-ass test” or a “big-ass problem” or a “funky-ass stink.” According to the Brandeis students the word “ass” in this hyphenated usage is not at all offensive and does not discriminate against or ridicule any shape size color or sexual orientation of ass although they agree that adding a “hyphen ass” to an adjective gives it some heft and color of novelty. As Captain Kirk in the Movie Star Trek: The Voyage Home” memorably replied to a rude driver who called him a dumb-ass “well double dumb-ass on you.”Brandeis students would presumably agree that while some on the outside may think they have gone “that’s bananas” about offensive words only a double dumb-ass would dare to call them “crazy” or “lame.”

And Italy won.England have always been rubbish at penalties. From traffic wardens to rugby regulations England have never been able to work out penalties - even though they wrote the rules. Penalties penalise players for penile play but who penalises the penalisers? It's a perennial philosophical question.Fans of England were expecting a victory because of their belief in their three lines on their shirt. Fan Sarah Ball said "The three lines on our shirt is so important. Because to a millenial three lines looks like a menu something that you click to open up a set of actions. And that's exactly how England should be playing."After England and Italy ground each other down to a 1-1 draw and after extra-time it was time for penalties.Many England players struggled at the Poena Macula - the hallowed term for what referees refer to as the penalty spot. Only the Pope is allowed to touch a penalty spot or a bishop in sight of witnesses. So Italy has an advantage because of their experience at this dark art.Nevertheless Harry Maguire scored a terrific penalty. The English twat somehow managed to ram in it the back of the net making every viewer say "how?" simultaneously.Meanwhile Johnson's Bane Marcus Rashford hit the post through an embarrassing error although it is believed that Tories engineered the miss through a remote-controlled ball because of the trouble that the player has been causing Boris's government.

The ball went up then down then up again across the screen like a game of Pong but on grass.It was literally riveting and I was glued to my screen for the full two hours or however long it was. It felt like longer.The tournament has been a great one. We all stuffed ourselves with Pimms and strawberries and cream and white wine and vodka and whatever else the bar sold until we were thrown out. That's the joy of tennis but it's the sport that always leaves you with a hangover.The winner this year was unknown Scot Jock O'Vitch. I'd never heard of him but I expect eating all that porridge has given him an arm that can hit a ball like a rugby player's foot.Cider. That's another one. I like Tesco's own brand myself. It's quite tart but very cheap. You have to watch your wallet.Where was Tim Henman? I think he got knocked out before the tournament even started. Still at least he's back on his feet again. I heard that a couple of years ago he starred in his own series of gay porn films called "Come on Tim" but maybe that was just a joke.I'm sure he can win Wimbledon next year if he remembers to turn up. Probably just had a few too many drinks and forgot he was competing. It happens to the best of us.Geoff Racket reports.

Maybe Italy can offer some sound advice in how to consume wobbly spaghetti or flabby pizzas and still not be infected by this seemingly idiosyncratic disease that visits England every two years!Hope is eternal!

It isn’t. Surviving Covid-19 is not a journey. It’s survival. Going to the grocery store to purchase cat food is not a journey it’s going to the grocery store.A flight from San Francisco to London is not a journey it’s a flight from San Francisco to London. So quit the journey for everything from changing diapers to getting a leg wax.Another request. Why doesn’t Novak Djokovic drop the silent D in his last name? His last name is pronounced Jokovic so why not just drop the D? That D makes it Damn confusing.Not only is his letter D confusing but it's also a journey back to bad grades during grammar school. D grades were given to students with creative skills of all sorts. They were on their own kind of journey.Finally why is anyone listening to Donald Trump? He is slowly on a journey to prison for behavior before during and after the White House. He fudged on his taxes.Who could have guessed? As Trump said "Who knew it was wrong?"He attempted to overturn an election encouraged the riot at the Capitol in addition women have accused him of misconduct. Trump's journey is endless.When did the US right to vote become a debate? Thousands have already died to secure that right.

Massive demonstrations outside the court in Sacramento with demonstrators on both sides indicate the decision whichever way it goes may result in mob violence.The unidentified patient reportedly a one-time Spoof writer who inadvertently swallowed a handful of hearing aid batteries that he mistakenly picked up off the bedroom floor thinking they were the bedtime pills he had just dropped has cost the retirement system an estimated $10 million in pension pay and health care costs since the event in July 2021. The cash-strapped and underfunded pension plan has tried for years without success to find a judge who will approve the life-ending plug pull. CALPERS lawyers now believe that the current makeup of the state supreme court with so many Jerry Brown appointees will give them a favorable decision.The "No Euthanasia" contingent outside the court house predicts that if this patient is allowed to die the next step will be to move to euthanize all retirees at age 72 the actuarial age at which most pensioners have taken in benefits all that they contributed during their working years.The legislature made the mistake not the retirees. Why not euthanize all those legislators who voted for the law? They knew it wasn't sound but it sure won them votes when they passed it. All were endorsed at the next election by the government workers' unions. Why not euthanize the legislators?"The current age of those drawing benefits is 80 which accounts for the financial sinkhole the plan is in."Conservatives For Euthanasia" were out in great numbers as well urging that the court support the CALPERS appeal."This is the first time we have ever been on the side of the pension plan. The "No Euthanasia"guys are right - as soon as we win this decision we'll go to court to get all those old guys euthanize at 72. Actually we'd prefer to have them euthanized at retirement with a small sop to their spouses instead of a lifetime pension. We've had too many 70 year old retirees become "domestic partners" with 20-year-olds who draw the pension seemingly forever. Hey maybe we can euthanize them too."When asked why the conservatives oppose death with dignity laws for terminally ill patients but support it for retirees the answer was simple. "God tells us when it's our time to go not a law but it's okay to end the life of gold-digging retired public workers because they've committed theft of public money."Among the protesters was an elderly woman who gave only her first name Mylvia - "It rhymes with Sylvia" she said. "No don't let the old buzzard die. He deserves prolonged pain for trying to re-connect with me 30 years ago. The nut even wrote a Spoof about me. [See "Spoof Writer 90. Dumped Twice by Same Girl 65 Years Apart."]With her was a former Miss America contestant from 1950 renowned by Spoof in a "Dumped Again" story by the unidentified Spoofer. "Pull the plug. End my misery I keep thinking he'll wake up and send me more emails."The high court is expected to make a decision by summer's end. Since most of the judges are in their 80s and eligible for retirement pay the fact that they were appointed by Jerry Brown may not be the determining factor.State Supreme Court Sacramento CA.

They simply said that there was no need to explain since even Stevie Wonder can see that she/he has a male perkerino between her legs (even though it’s the size of an acorn) but none-the-less.Miss (or rather Mr. Shirtquist) said that she/he was embarrassed as hell and asked if she could at least keep her sash and the $200000 college scholarship.Judge Emma Tantalini who was recently cleared of the embezzlement charges replied “No ma’am! or rather no sir!”Tantalini then remarked that she needs to go to the bathroom and remove her official Miss USA competitive bra panties and pantyhose and return them to the judges immediately.Meanwhile Judge Brody Ficka told Miss/Mr. Shirtquist that she/he is very lucky that they do not charge her/him with statutory impersonation of a beauty contest contestant.Shirtquist started crying like a sissygirl and then blurted out “Bite me!” as she turned and swished out of the building riding off on her pink Joan of Arc Yamaha motorcycle.
Tuesday 13 July 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/153512/us-bridges-falling-down-falling-down-falling-down,US Bridges Falling Down Falling Down Falling Down,President Joe Biden has introduced a $3 trillion infrastructure bill to rebuild the States' decaying infrastructure including fixing bridges and roads. It's nice to be able to drive onto a bridge with a guarantee that you’ll make it to the other side and not end up in the water sinking like Michael Douglas in the suspense film The Game.Even some roads in the US have road-kill potholes. The kind of pothole that can cause a flat tire or cracked axle.Besides roads and bridges water and telephone lines have to be maintained. There are gas and oil wells that have to be plugged Veterans Hospitals and clinics need to be updated. Same with schools homes and buildings. Think of the 12-floor condominium that collapsed in Florida. That condominium in Florida killing 94 people didn’t collapse because its infrastructure was well maintained.This is the United States of America where living is supposed to be easy and homes are not supposed to collapse.However Trump Republicans who would never cross out a Defense Department gadget say No to the Infrastructure Bill.Maybe if the Infrastructure Bill could be squeezed into the Defense Department budget it would pass like Bingo.You can’t take a fighter jet or a helicopter to the grocery store.Bingo! That's what Republicans must use.Read more by this author:

Tuesday 13 July 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/world/153507/newsflash-for-new-agers-trusting-the-universe-is-a-bad-idea,Newsflash for New Agers: Trusting the universe is a bad idea,It seems the more we learn about our world and solar system the worse the New Age movement looks. It’s commonly known that many modern-day seekers are inclined to believe in the goodness of The Universe and the importance of getting into the flow. These days the call to ‘trust the universe’ is often heard.Now it turns out this way of thinking is based on faulty assumptions. A series of experiments conducted at Stanford University have shown conclusively that what some call “wishful thinking” actually creates an adverse effect on events that follow.Stanford’s Wilbur Steinfeller the study’s chief researcher explains: “In other words the universe makes us work for everything. It can also at random times punish people trying silly shortcuts. That’s what the study showed us.”In recent years we learned through quantum physics that matter (particles) behave differently depending on whether they are being watched or not. As it turns out that should have been the tip-off because that implies we are being observed and our observer seems to enjoy trifling with us.Many ancient cultures believed in this world was created and is overseen by a trickster god and these latest research results seem to back that assertion. With the Stanford experiments continuing through the summer and early fall we expect to learn more so stay tuned!
Tuesday 13 July 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/153505/sos-from-jon-taffer-and-bar-rescue,SOS from Jon Taffer and Bar Rescue,The timing was perfect. Jon Taffer star of Bar Rescue had just launched into his customary rant aimed at another fledgling proprietor when he got the surprise of his life. Rick Regan and crew entered the scene on behalf of Reality Fix to turn the tables on Taffer. It was the debut episode for Reality Fix a show with the mission of “keeping all reality TV real and legit!”“What makes you think people want to watch you behave like a brazen alpha male baboon every damn week? Are you nuts Jon?!!” Regan snapped at the stunned Taffer.Initially Taffer showed a flash of anger at having his customary tirade interrupted but thought better of it when he saw Regan’s Reality Fix production crew. Camera operator Tom Frank said “Taffer’s eyes had the look of a cornered wild boar who couldn’t decide whether to attack or make a run for it.”Thew Bar Rescue host kept silent during Regan’s critique but when he found an opening spoke to him in a calm manner repeating the words “Ok fair enough. Ok fair enough.”Taffer then excused himself and went to speak quietly with the bar owner he’d berated moments earlier. He was soon joined by his producer-director David Owens who called for a 10-minute break. Owens apparently hadn’t known of the ambush either.Moments later Regan and Reality Fix production chief Mel Sargant protested saying they needed to “get on with it”. Taffer finally began cooperating after Sargant got in his face yelling “this isn’t how it’s supposed to work Jon!”We later learned that the Executive Producer of both shows Arnold Simon had given his blessing to the stunt.
Tuesday 13 July 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/153504/parking-goddess-missing-whereabouts-unknown,Parking Goddess missing; whereabouts unknown,A report filed yesterday by official NSA sources within the US Government included a rather unwelcome development for unassuming people that pray to the Parking Goddess. Maya Moskovitz has not been seen or heard from in almost 130 years. Ms. Moskovitz had enjoyed some mild fame in the late 1800s as Goddess of the Hitching Post and was widely assumed to have moved to Parking Goddess status around 1920. At that point thanks to the low demand no one suspected she was missing.Unfortunately Moskovitz never really caught on as a major deity. This was primarily due to the fact that most horseback riders and waggoners were non-believers but apparently Moskovitz didn’t help her own cause. Observers from the era report that she was never fully dedicated to her role focusing instead on random parlor tricks as an uninvited guest at seances. She also enjoyed molesting cowpokes as they slept under the stars.Ironically the few believers she did have in the late 19th Century were the more sophisticated erudite city dwellers who rarely had any need for hitching posts.As a result Moskovitz simply drifted away due to lack of interest. Some believe she may have gotten a better offer on a distant unknown solar system. Whatever the case Moskovitz has not been heard from since early June 1896 when silver miner William (Billy) Burton called on her late that afternoon as he sped toward the main hitching post on Main Street of Calico CA in San Bernardino County on the edge of the Mojave Dessert.While the goddess did answer his prayers providing an open spot as he approached witnesses reported Burton’s bowels let loose as he was securing his rig. An awful scene ensued as a frustrated and humiliated Burton removed his trousers to wash off at a nearby water pump. Residents soon took exception and Burton was assaulted with a 2x4 before being arrested for being a public menace and disturbing the peace. According to town records he was locked up for an entire weekend before appearing in court where he paid a $80 fine and ordered to clean all of Main Street end-to-end which was 280 yards in length at the time.It is not known whether the Burton mishap had anything to do with the goddess abandoning her role but most of the speculation says she was bored and disenchanted with the role.“If it’s fame and recognition she desires the role of Parking Goddess would surely provide those things” said NSA spokesperson Randall Heilwacher. “We register hundreds of calls from would-be worshippers calling for her every single day!”Hielwacher provided an unsolicited description of NSA’s monitoring process which picks up prayers in addition to random thoughts and cell phone traffic. Asked if there was a possibility of NSA officials contacting Moskovitz for her return Hielwacher would not comment on any communication that has transpired between Moskovitz and the NSA.

In exchange members pay a recurring monthly flat fee of $10000.Stacksmiller explains “we know many of our high rollers are exhausted by their long hours at the tables and we’ve also heard from quite a few angry wives and girlfriends. The PKDP membership solves all such problems. Those customers will find they now have all sorts of time for family and other recreational activities. Of course we sweeten the pot by providing them with complimentary dinners at five-star restaurants along with the best available tickets to major sporting events!”Stacksmiller then went on to talk about the other key benefit to PKDP membership: “Even the best of us get in over our heads from time to time but as a PKDP member you know exactly what you’re paying every month so you set your budget accordingly!”The program is currently in the pilot test phase with only one PKDP membership belonging to longstanding member Johnny Degenerato. Mr Degenrato was spotted yesterday sitting on the curb outside the Darkstar Casino in Providence RI. He was locked in to his cell phone and when approached he refused to comment. A casino security guard approached Degenrato but backed off after being shown the member's star-key that is issued with PKDP membership.According to early reports sales for the premium membership are stagnant but officials are hopeful things will pick up “once the word gets out there”.

It started with the gigantic announcement that millions were poured into the Sussex coffer free at last and out of Tyler Perry’s rent-free home purchased their own place with the 16 bathrooms but hey where are those Netflix productions?The Invictus Games? Old news. That was already seen and done and in the lineup before Harry Met Meghan. So what have they done brand new for Netflix? It’s as though the Sussex’s won The Publishers Clearing House Sweepstakes: Take the money and spend.Barack and Michele Obama received a similar deal from Netflix but are not producing projects based on personal experiences.Now if Spoof Writers were to be given a Sussex deal by Netflix you can bet you would have one WHAM-BANG original production after the next. No see the bump and then the run with Spoof Writers.Shhhh! But the whispered rumor (and MI5 might be involved) is that the Sussex kids were born by a surrogate mother which is one way to have children but apparently no way for a royal baby to be born. A royal baby must be born of the royal wife or no royal title.Eventually all these rumors and innuendoes gossip and ambiguities will be brought to an end with the release of a Sussex Netflix production and a look-see at Archie’s sister.Read more by this author:

And that was just the 12-year-old son who looked out of shape.The rest of the family waddled off to their rented jeep after seeing images of their brave GI's bombarded in foxholes for 8 days in temperatures under -15 degrees centigrade and decided it was time for a nutritional change in honour of their heroes.However one rather obese Belgian family after visiting the museum were interviewed by Jaggedone's overweight star CIA (Cockroach Infiltration Army) war reporter Billy Bunter-Bloater. They decided to ignore their 'bulges' and blamed US GI's for giving their grandparents Coca Cola Chocolate and other US candy goodies after forcibly removing naughty Nazis from their country."Gottverdomme I love my 'bulges' and will always be thankful to America for giving us such wonderful unhealthy fattening foods pop-me-some-corn baby!" Was their answer.German obese families visiting the wonderful museum also blame the US for their 'Bulges' but instead of battling them in honour of the defeated Wehrmacht they feel they actually won the 'Battle of the Bulge' by exporting fatty German Bratwurst and Frankfurters to the US which Yanks just love!

Instead you shrug and ask for another coke. But then Donald Trump blasted the report in the Guardian.Trump referred to the Guardian article as the radical left crazies doing whatever they can to demean everybody on the right.The Guardian says otherwise.

Trump and Putin were in cahoots? The lovefest was for real and not for reel? Did Trump trade democracy for communism? If he traded one for the other does that make Trump a traitor?Not so fast.According to secretly released Kremlin documents Putin okayed one of his spy agencies (he has dozens) to promote the mentally unstable Donald Trump in the 2016 US presidential election.Russian ministers reasoned that a mentally unstable Donald Trump in the White House would permanently weaken the United States.Wow! Putin classified Trump as mentally unstable? What did Putin know about Trump that the MAGA people didn’t know? After all Putin lives all the way in Russia.Hmmm?Maybe Putin knew about the Moscow Ritz-Carlton Presidential Suite pee video? Remember how former MI6 agent Christopher Steele was hammered when The Steele Dossier was made public and Steel had to go into hiding?Vladimir Putin authorized Russian support of a Donald Trump election during a closed session of Russia’s national security council. Well yes Putin wouldn’t exactly make such an authorization live on a CNN broadcast.So maybe Trump thought he was getting Putin’s support because Trump had a giant political intellect however NOT because Putin thought Trump was mentally. unstable.So Trump squeaked into the White House in 2016 with Putin’s help and Hillary Clinton headed for the woods.What else could Hillary do? Ask her supporters to march to the Capitol and fight for their country because Trump and Putin stole the election?Read more by this author:

The winner who has earned the coveted honor ten times previously in his forty year career at Winsocki is Geography professor Gregor McTavish.Dean Higgins read the citation before an audience that filled the auditorium as nearly every professor on campus was in attendance hoping not to be the winner of Winsocki's highest honor."Of the approximately 200 members of the Winsocki faculty 190 were nominated by our students for the Most Distinguished Mediocre prize. A committee composed of the ten not nominated devoted four weeks to review of the nominees. Gregor McTavish was their unanimous choice Higgins said. A humble McTavish rose amid thunderous applause from the faculty relieved that they had not won the prize.Among the deciding factors were these; McTavish mumbled through his written lecture notes in a sing-song manner that was musically entertaining.If a student missed a lecture an alum's notes from up to forty years ago would contain the lecture verbatim.McTavish diligently held four office hours a week although he was rarely there at the times posted outside his door.For consistency in grading he gave the same exams each semester only altering one multiple choice answer when he discovered after thirty years that what had been the correct answer all those years was wrong: Bonneville Dam is not upstream from Grand Coulee.In accepting the award a humble McTavish thanked the selection committee and said it was a pleasure to teach Winsocki students who so easily absorb all that I teach as evidenced by the fact that they never ask questions."As the ceremony ended McTavish turned to Higgins and said "Dean..." at which point he was interrupted by Higgins: "Don't call me by my first name. Use my title."

Amazon's Jeff Bezos is going up to real outer space on his rocket Blue Origin Tuesday July 20.It seems it isn’t outer space unless you go past the Karman Line which is 62 miles up. Branson's rocket only went 50 miles up. Did Branson experience weightlessness? Maybe yes maybe no.The International Space Station sits 250 miles up there well past the Karman Line. Everyone floats around weightless with the greatest of ease.

But that bill is now worth just $0.32 and isn’t enough to buy a cup of coffee.

The competition will be run under strict coronavirus restrictions with no crowds and major changes to the participating sports.All athletes must social distance and remain 2 metres apart at all times which means that some sports such as wrestling and synchronised swimming have had to be scrapped. Also the running tracks have had to be widened so much that all the lanes will be made of moving walkways running at different speeds to compensate for the longer distances run by competitors in the outside lanes.Many new sports have been introduced to take advantage of the coronavirus fever which is sweeping the planet. They include:Some completely new demonstration sports have been added to help showcase the skills many of us have developed during lockdown in the last year. Those include:Many commentators are questioning whether the Olympics should take place at all and at least one Japanese company has offered to replace all the athletes with robots.But it's not all doom and gloom. The opening ceremony will highlight Japan's incredible culture. It will feature a samurai dressed as a cat robot singing Yoko Ono hits on karaoke while raw fish is dumped over his head by an origami Godzilla monster.

Although at times their slapstick behavior could easily qualify them to take on the mantle of The Three Stooges.With her sunken eyes and penchant for premium ice cream Nancy Poozleosi most closely resembles Moe. Short of a finger-poke and a nyuk-nyuk she stands in line to become the President if both Cackleosi and Sleepleosi can’t get a laugh.And Kamala Cackleosi: She could easily step into the presidency if Sleepy Joe forgets how to read his lines. Her demented laugh whether a nervous reaction to a question she doesn’t want to answer or more likely a consequence of her putting her heels on too many shoulders as she climbed the ladder of political success sets her apart from the others. Like Larry she usually plays the fool while Moe and Curley do all the hard work.Then there is Joe Sleepleosi Curly’s counterpart. Easily the most popular of the Stooges Curly was known for his high-pitched voice and vocal expression (“nyuk-nyuk-nyuk!” “woob-woob-woob!”). Sleepy Joe to play the fool recently incorporated an exaggerated stage whisper to his repertoire.And there they are: The Three Stooges of the Apocalypse.Dr. Slim: “With a cast like that what can go wrong?”Dirty: “Yo Doctor.

He and some co-workers Canada Goose set a trap and ambushed Arnold bringing him to the Cape Cod Wildlife Center for an exam and treatment.As it turned out Arnold’s leg was broken in two places. The doctor guessed the damage done by a snapping turtle. What they didn’t know was that Arnold was a goose with a double life and he didn’t take kindly to the kind gesture by the wildlife advocates.Since his hospitalization anonymous sources have divulged that Arnold is a long-time associate of the Gambino crime family. They say he travels to the New York City area monthly to meet with his cohorts to plan scams or discuss other mob business.Word on the street is that Arnold’s leg was broken by a rogue turkey called “Jasper”. According to the source: “Jasper was running his operation as an independent bookie and refusing to pay tribute. So Arnold was sent to tune the guy up but instead he got tuned up himself.”The source did speculate that Arnold’s standing with the family had been damaged adding “it’s never easy for a goose no matter how hard you work.”Arnold and his mate Wilma have lived on a pond near Cape Cod's Cape Wildlife Center for years. They are low profile birds by all accounts until recently. Wilma is now camped out outside the center’s side entrance where she has a clear view of her mate most of the time. Asked about her feelings Wilma had no comment.Arnold is not talking either but sources say Arnold is angry with his caretakers and that he may be planning some form of revenge. “He’s been known to fly off the handle. No tellin’ what he might do once he gets out.”

She encountered old friend Johnson coming out of a salon where she had just gotten a make-over and reportedly feeling good.It was by all accounts a pleasant encounter at first. But then Johnson who seemed almost giddy said the magic words "...you know 60 is the new 40!" At which point Dandeneau slapped her face briskly quickly adding "It's legal to do that now! New law! It's actually my responsibility to do that..." Dandeneau was referring of course to the new federal law now in effect that makes Johnson's statement a slappable offense.The slap stopped Johnson dead in her tracks and after a few seconds pause she turned beet red before mumbling something unintelligible then got back to her car and speeding off.She has now filed a law suit suing Dandeneau for damages. The suit= will ultimately challenge the new law.

Here you go!,In the 1880’s Jefferson Howard was the 42-year-old son of a freedman who had made a name for himself as a chic fashion designer among the well-to-do. Jefferson was a good-natured soul grateful for his station in life. He had established himself as a top fashion designer of men’s formal and leisure wear in New York City with an impressive list of clients.He generally had no qualms with white people especially those who were decent and respectful. One of few exceptions was the leisurely pastime of golf. Howard thought it was a silly game with senseless obscure protocol and rules that like tennis were made deliberately difficult. He also saw it as an awful waste of land; not to mention the time and effort required for maintenance. Howard had grown up on a farm and equated open land to potential for nourishment. And if that wasn’t enough he’d had a few unpleasant run-ins with golfers and considered them snobby elitists.But in an odd twist of fate one of Howard’s top clients Richard P. Thompson asked him to design golf attire for the “modern” golfer of the late 19th century. Thompson’s family owned the Sycamore Sportswear Company one of the biggest and most successful of its kind. Thompson saw an opportunity to capture a growing market of wealthy whites who golfed devotedly on weekends. The sport had originated in Scotland; with the traditional wide-cut pants in checkered patterns and the flat caps could still be seen occasionally.This gave Howard an opening to create some outlandish clothing styles that golfers still wear to this day. In later years Howard admitted “Those people behaved like buffoons so I thought it was only right they looked the part.”

Therefore whenever a wearer of a bodycam is within twenty feet of a policeman the camera will automatically switch on."Another idea recommended by Black Lives Matter is 'KarenCams'. Again worn by minorities the camera will automatically switch on whenever a wearer is within ten feet of an entitled white woman or inside a Target store or Starbucks.

I should have could have would have listened.It seems millions of people pooh poohed the idea of wearing masks indoors outdoors on planes trains schools bars and rallies."That's like Nazi Germany." Or "Masks make Americans look weak."They also ignored the medical community’s urgent pleas to get vaccinated against the coronavirus.Coronavirus was almost over the light was at the end of the tunnel licked despite the negativity.Hospital numbers were going way down. Biden came to D.C. on his super horse and announced a goal of 200 million Covid vaccinations in one hundred days. Biden's vaccination goal was met and surpassed. He then set another goal for more vaccinations. Things were moving like pronto. There was a leader in town.Then a new word started to enter the media’s vernacular: Variant.What?It seems there was a brand new strain of Covid-19 that was even deadlier than the old coronavirus that was almost licked.It was rumored to have developed in India and called the Delta Variant. However because so many of the people who pooh poohed getting the Covid-19 vaccinations or wearing masks those very same people were now being struck down by the variant and pleading for vaccinations. It was too late.This is where getting bitten in the rear becomes a reality.The chances are that this Christmas may be another lockdown quarantined indoor mail order no seeing Santa Claus kind of Christmas.And hopefully without losing any more seniors juniors relatives friends who could have been saved had they been vaccinated.Someone said it was going to be like the flu.And people listened.Read more by this author:

Wednesday 4 August 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/153653/should-new-york-governor-cuomo-resign,Should New York Governor Cuomo Resign?,The question is as is often asked should Governor Andrew Cuomo resign or should he remain? Fast answer: He wasn't elected by the (covering all bases) maybe 100 women who presented sexual harassment charges and or complaints about his behavior.He won the election fair and square against Sex And The City co-star Cynthia Nixon. (presumedly no relation)A majority of New York voters elected Governor Andrew Cuomo. It is their right and privilege to decide whether to remove him from office or to allow him to remain. So even if 1000 women stepped forward voicing sexual harassment complaints it would remain the voters' decision.They gave him the job. But then they vote him out of that job.Maybe women who work on his staff should be issued cattle prods. The cheapest on Amazon called The Hot Shot sells for $32.00. Same-day mail would add to the price. The more expensive prod called The Parker McCory sells for $45.99. The most expensive prod listed sells for $594.99 and looks as though it could stop an aircraft carrier. It goes by the Gruesome name of the Blitz-Kerner Non-Penetrating Captive….If a cattle prod had to be used Governor Cuomo would then have to reimburse the buyer. Sort of a double whammy.This may sound like a 3rd world solution and send his brave and horrified mother to tears but what works for a herd of cattle should work in the Governor's office.Remember Governor Cuomo took over the Covid-19 epidemic and demonstrated executive skills while Donald Trump slept. Cuomo mobilized the nation to supply ventilators and masks to states that were short on supply. The guy saved lives.Lastly he never paid a porn star hush money or announced “You can grab them by the pussy and get away with it.”Read more by this author:

Poor old Heinz wet his pants before help arrived!After the tragic incident Heinz's wife was give some sound advice for the future by the nurse who arrived too late "Frau Humperdinck in the future only by undies for your hubby without a Y then he does not have to attempt to pee from the rear if he puts them on back to front get it?"Heinz is now quite happy when needing a pee because he does not have to look for a slit anymore and just whips his pants down to enjoy relieving himself like most men do of all ages!

The reason said a White House source speaking off the record is “because he feels if it’s not one thing it’s two others.”Biden’s dour outlook is said to be a result of the constant calls he gets from members of his own party in Congress as well as the ever-present drama that is portrayed in the media. Said the source “the President is under increasing pressure to acknowledge every little thing that some vocal Democrats find racist homophobic excessive policing or just mansplaining to name a few.”Vice President Kamala Harris has been reported to be providing the President with a daily ‘white paper’ of troubling events that her staff has compiled. Biden is said to have become so overwhelmed with having to address each issue that he decided to just let a weary flag speak for the administration.GOP lawmakers with little recourse to the president’s declaration have proposed reducing the height of federal flag poles by half to give the illusion of an upright stars and stripes. Said a party operative “if there’s one thing the Republican party stands for it’s harking back to the days of old glory reigning supreme over the nation.”
Friday 6 August 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/153673/some-good-news-for-governor-cuomo,Some Good News for Governor Cuomo,It has been a rough week for the Honorable Andrew Cuomo New York’s beleaguered governor.Everyone from President Biden to the entire New York congressional delegation is calling on the governor to resign following a report issued by New York’s Attorney General concluding that Cuomo sexually harassed eleven women.Cuomo has been in office for over a decade and he’s been able to maintain his hold on power despite his years of alleged bullying and sexual harassment.He also particularly exemplified hubris by writing a book that touted his crisis leadership lessons at the same time his administration was covering up the number of deaths in nursing homes caused by his pandemic crisis policies.Clearly the man has a lot of Donald Trump in him and the Donald J Trump POS Award Foundation (“Foundation”) hopes that Cuomo who will likely be impeached if he does not resign will find at least some solace with the news that he has won the 2021 Donald J Trump POS Award (“the award”).Governor Cuomo will receive a designer-made orange jumpsuit a bronze weasel paperweight for his desk and partial payment of Rudy Giuliani’s fees for any service he might provide in the defense of Mr. Cuomo.The Foundation was originally going to make its award in December but it concluded that no one will be more deserving of the 2021 award than Governor Cuomo.The Foundation acknowledged that although there are other eligible candidates such as Congressman Gaetz or Senator Hawley these individuals “slink around” in the bush leagues.None of them has or ever will attain the “success” that Governor Cuomo or former president Trump have.In short these individuals are Trump wannabees while Cuomo has proven to be “a true Trumpian POS.”

Not exactly a choice between Ice cream or pie but that's the dessert that's being offered up to the Governor.He could say no to both choices and sit it out like Trump.Some see it as another dent in voter's rights. So instead of voter suppression get rid of the Democratic candidates after they win the election.Governor Cuomo won his election. He demonstrated executive ability to save lives nationwide during the first Covid-19 epidemic.But the guy can't keep his hands inside his pockets.Should the nation posthumously dump George Washington for his dalliance with Sally Fairfax? Of course Martha Washington wasn’t too happy about it but at the very least Governor Andrew Cuomo is a divorced bachelor. Not that it makes his actions acceptable.Republicans are working at voter suppression by taking the vote away from voters of color and gays. Otherwise Republicans (who remain a bigoted minority) believe they will never win another election. Which And could be possible.Pass the pie a la Mode.Read more by this author:

Of course everyone knows that Hunter Biden left his laptop with a repair shop in New York only to forget to reclaim it. The owner of the shop downloaded all of its contents finding among other things pictures of Hunter snorting cocaine and balancing two nekid hookers on his loin area.Carlos Danger also earned his stripes with Cybersecurity the hard way (a pun thank you). He was arrested and did time for taking pictures of himself in his Skivvies and sending them unsolicited to young ladies evidently hoping to have his Weiner immortalized. Can’t blame him. He’s so ugly his parents had to tie a porkchop around his neck so the family dog would play with him.Together President Biden hopes that the two men will eventually solve the Cybersecurity threat that has cost millions in ransomware and threatens to take down our Nation’s infrastructure.Dr. Slim: “Good choice. I think we got a Weiner here.”Slim: “Yo Dr. Dude. But that’s a hard one to swallow.”

She’s not my type.”Huh?Besides the men and women who are not subservient to the knuckle dragger the knuckle dragger also dislikes minorities of any color and gays of any choice.Instead of recognizing that the world is a tapestry of different colors in nature and that it is also populated with a tapestry of people of different colors the knuckle dragger thinks that the color white is superior even though the knuckle dragger's knuckles metaphorically drag near the ankle.Believing that they are white and superior to people of other colors a knuckle dragger often lives in a state of denial.

He seems to think that by agreeing with Donald Trump’s message of the Lysol and Clorox cocktail no masks or vaccines it will deliver him right up and into that White House.He’d have a better chance riding an alligator to Washington D.C.But he’s taking a stand like Rudolph Giuliani and Sydney Powell who are presently facing catastrophic fines for doing Donald Trump’s bidding taking nuisance voter fraud cases to courts. Judges say no can do to nuisance cases.On Saturday August 7 Florida reported 23903 new COVID-19 cases 93 deaths 13348 hospitalizations.Can Governor DeSantis count or read? Does he think those numbers will still get him to Washington and the White House?Why not? It works for Trump. However Donald Trump is doing a slow sink like the Titanic for his peccadillos. Bill Barr used to be a safe lifeboat but he isn’t around anymore. Mitch McConnell was another lifeboat and he has also sailed away.Time to impeach and remove Governor DeSantis from office. Governor Andrew Cuomo was a hands-on flirt but never intentionally killed anyone through ignorance or dismissed the science.Read more by this author:
Sunday 8 August 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/153687/the-three-little-pigs-and-the-gay-wolf,The Three Little Pigs and The Gay Wolf,The best version:Once upon a time there was a mother pig who had three little pigs named Corn Biscuit and Doughnut. Her husband was a drunkard who would listen to pop music all day.One day she said to them "It's time for you to go out into the world to make your fortune because your father got tossed into prison for burglary and he's unable to raid anymore gardens to feed you."The three little pigs packed their bags and said good-bye to their mum. They left the house and each went along a different path.The first little pig soon met a blind man with a load of straw. "Please mister will you give me some straw to build a house in exchange for some hash I grew in my garden?"The man did and the little pig quickly built himself a straw house with a large straw barn in the rear of his home. It was not a very strong house but the little pig was so happy he began to dance and sing.This piggy was smart because he had a herd of sheep in his barn to fool any hungry wolf. Every night he would dress as a sheep and sleep with the herd so a wolf could eat a sheep and be so full he would not want to eat him.Along came a gay and desperate wolf who knocked at the door and galled out in a gruff voice "Little pig little pig let me come in."The wolf then saw a note on the door "If you're a wolf and you're hungry I got sheep in the barn!""You will be sorry" growled the wolf. "I only love pigs with pink flesh."So the wolf dressed himself as a sheep and he entered the barn and he layed down behind a sleeping sheep. It was pitch dark and the wolf said "What a surprise I could smell pig innards."Now the second little pig walked along a path until he met an ugly fat woman carrying a load of twigs. "Would you be so kind lady as to give me some twigs so I can build a house?" The woman who had not bathed in a year said "Yes but you first need to lick my feet until I'm satisfied and then you need to give me a much needed bath using your wet tongue since the nearest water well is ten miles away."The little pig quickly built himself a house of twigs. It was not a very strong house but the little pig was so happy that he bagan to dance and play his flute. He then recieved a disturbing message on his answering machine from the first little pig "Hurry! A gay wolf is coming for you!"The second little pig being the smartest of the three decided to trick the wolf. He build a trap door inside his home facing his front door. He put a ladder in the hole in case he were to accidentally fall inside. He also placed a latch on top of the trap door so he could quickly put a lock on the latch once the wolf falls in. It was a brilliant plan.Unfortunately the second little pig forgot about the trap door in the morning when he went to pick up his daily newspaper. When the little pig fell he landed on his head and became unconscious.Then along came the gay and cunning wolf. He knocked at the door and called out in a gruff voice "Little pig little pig let me come in."The bewildered wolf read a note on the door "Welcome Mr. wolf I left you a baked ham in the oven."You will be sorry" growled the wolf. "After breakfast I will have you for desert."So the wolf walked in and fell down the hole. It was pitch dark and very quite and the wolf said "What a surprise I could smell pig innards."The third little pig walked until he met a man with a load of bricks. "Please sir would you give me some bricks to build a house?" I'm good at hand jobs when you need it.The man did and the little pig built himself a brick mansion. It took him a long time but it was a lot stronger than a straw house or a house of twigs. The little pig was very happy. He sat down and played a Liberace tune on his piano.The third little pig got a frantic phone call from the second little pig "Save yourself by leaving town there's a gay wolf on the prowl!"Then along came the tired and nasty wolf. He was shocked to see the brick mansion painted pink. He noticed writing engraved on a floor mat situated in front of the door that says "If You Can't Win Give It Up." He knocked at the door and called out in a gruff voice "Little pig little pig let me come in."The third little pig walked outside dressed in drag and said "There's no point in blowing down the door of your new house.""I'm sorry" said the wolf gently. "I will huff and I will puff when I'm inside the house my darling."A witness reported seeing the wolf and his piggy living happly ever after socializing in the 'Horse Meat Disco' at Eagle London.

Vitamin C won’t do any good. Gluten-free or vegan? Forget it.It’s spreading like wildfire in every continent because it is wildfire. Planet earth is sick and burning up with a temperature and that fire will soon reach everyone’s doorstep. A garden hose ain’t going do anything but create steam.Blame it on combustion engines? Some of it. Streets and freeways bridges and highways are crawling with cars and trucks that produce temperature-raising fumes.While grown-ups ignore the signs children are more realistic.“Thank you pop! We’re inheriting a burnt house. Why didn’t you at least try using the garden hose?”“It’d just have created steam.”Wars throughout the planet add to the temperature rising. Can’t you live your own life and let a Palestinian family live theirs? Hey Taliban why don’t you put down your guns and rockets quit your hatred of educated women and try turning a desert into a garden? Too dumb and think your manhood is better demonstrated by carrying a rifle? Now that is stupid.Multi trillion dollars military-industrial complex quit. Enough is enough. Stop encouraging wars for gigantic profit. When the planet is in cinders you aren’t going to escape to Mars in a Space-X rocket with a sack full of cash and live happily ever after.And world dictators take the money retire to Switzerland and stop the worldwide migration of people trying to escape your tyranny. You got into office using a coup and rigged every election afterward. Quit. Audrey Hepburn had great taste and chose Switzerland.

The charge came from one of his many female aides identified simply as "Administrative Assistant Number Nine."When asked by The Spoof reporter Bluster what the governor specifically did Number Nine was initially reluctant to reveal details publicly. "Did he touch your breasts?" Bluster asked."No and that was part of the problem. I encouraged him to do that. One day I wore a tight sweater without a bra hoping he would get the point so to speak. Well his hand went under my sweater but got no farther than my belly button which he tickled. That was funny done once but this became a habit of his and I didn't want my belly button fondled.""Is that all he did or didn't do?" Bluster asked."I wore a low cut grass skirt one day kind of thinly put together trying to entice him to fondle something else lower down. His hand actually went up to my b. b. again. That's when I filed my complaint with the feds.""If he had done the normal thing and touched the usual parts guys go for there would have been no problem. But he had this b.b. obsession. He even asked me if that's where the babies come out."When asked about the indictment the governor said it was all politics. He is a Trump holdover waiting for Biden to get around to appointing a new governor for Mellowneshia. With over 150 ambassadors at least 500 consuls and numerous other overseas appointments for Biden to make and with Mellowneshia last on the list the governor was likely to be in office until Trump is re-elected in 2024. So the federal prosecutor in Mellowneshia a Obama holdover - Trump never got around to replacing him - took matters into his own hands and filed the charge of inappropriate sexual contact.The case goes to trial next week.

You see every time you go to a site it asks you to accept cookies. Well I don’t mind them using that American word if they have to so I always used to ‘accept’ and thought nothing of it but then the computer started malfunctioning so I took it to Evans the hardware and I said ‘Do you think it’s the cookies?’. ‘No’ he said but I persisted. I said ‘What if I took the back off and shook it a bit? The crumbs – do you think it’s full of crumbs from all those ‘cookies’ as they call them?’ Oh he just looked at me. But they’re funny like that in Blaenau. So I departed.Mr Jestif insisted “There is something funny going on. I have written to them all and never even received a civil reply let alone a biscuit! I was thinking of writing to Dame Shirley Bassey. I’m sure she’s partial to a bit of welsh cake after she’s done one of her James Bond songs. Or Sir Tom Jones. He’d know what to do. He goes over big in Las Vegas.”At this point Mr Jestif became pensive. “Perhaps I should have made a concession! Perhaps I should have written ‘I’ve not received any ‘cookies’ instead of calling them biscuits. You see that’s the problem – language. Oh yes. That’s the problem!"

None other than Sean Hannity of FOX NEWS described Durham as “meaner than a nun going through menopause.”Durham in his travels racked up more mileage than Lassie. He personally interviewed everyone from British spy Christopher Steele to the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in his quest to find the truth.Since it is impossible for the Justice Department to release anything factual because It is against the DOJ code of ethics it is estimated that over 12 million dollars was spent on the report with not one cent being used for a necessity other than food and drink. That amount was not even close to that racked up by Robert Mueller in his report; around 32 Extra-Large.Although the Durham Report has not yet been released to the public apparently only one person - a sad sack former FBI attorney - has been prosecuted. He was sentenced to one year of probation and awarded a Good Conduct Medal by the FBI for his obfuscation efforts.However BILLINGSGATE Special Investigative Reporter Detrick “Dirty Trick” Detwiler having sifted through the DOJ security dumpster found discarded pictures of the Love Birds laughing and giggling while trying on some of J Edgar Hoover’s wardrobe in the Hoover Memorabilia Closet.Not since posing as Russian hookers in drag when Slim and Dirty walked into the Hoover Building like they owned the joint telling the receptionist that they were the Russian prostitutes who peed on Donald Trump's bed in the Moscow hotel had he had so much fun.In the infamous Christopher Steele dossier that was paid for by Hillary Clinton the hookers were described as "Urinater 1" and "Urinater 2" . Their real names were Urina Uno and Urina Dos. Of Ukraine - Spanish descent it was only the first of many coincidences mentioned in the report.To be sure and it has been stated many times 99.6% of FBI agents are as pure as the fresh driven snow. It's only the ones who occupy the top floor who seem to go bad. The Love Birds fit that description: Early ripe. Early rotten.Among the pictures Dirty recovered from the security dumpster was one of James Comey. Wearing a mixed ensemble featuring a feathered boa and a pink ruffled tulle with satin shrugs he wobbled like a spavined Cockwomble in his three-inch hour glass heels with open toes.Meanwhile the Love Birds are sitting on their perches pecking away until the Durham Report is finally released by the Department of Justice.Dr. Slim: “Long time coming. Can’t wait until justice is done.”Dirty: “Yo Doctor. Should name it “Bull Durham Report.”

They make a great oil painting and keep the rest of the world civil. Well maybe not so much anymore but still the only thing left near to having good manners. Well forget the recent whiners.Let’s say they look great on the balcony. Okay? And the women are hat crazy.Where else can you find that kind of pageantry? Men in red jackets and faux bear hats riding horses in parades? The Queen addressing Parliament wearing that carpet of an ermine cape.And their weddings? They give Martha Stewart’s wedding book some competition. The royal bakers appear to start baking the wedding cake when the engagement is announced. Crunch.The divorces? Not so good. Pass the cabbages. Kate Middleton comes from a family that has happy smiles. The Duchess of Cambridge doesn’t look for a camera locates it and then pops a smile.Others? Not so sincere. Even though there's no business like show business she wasn’t smiling when she was low. Instead she griped all the way to Montecito her prince's head bent and following behind chirping about protecting his family.Families in Pakistan need protection not heirs of the royal family.Latent sympathy and understanding have finally developed for Prince Charles all because of the daughter-in-law.Even Shakespeare never thought of that one. He came close with King Lear. The Beatles? No. Maybe George Bernard Shaw? Chekhov? "...more clouds of grey. Than any Russian play could guarantee."It might just end up happy! The Queen could retire. Charles becomes king. Can’t have two Queens. So no Queen Camilla.

Geoff Agony Doctor of Music answers your questions.Dear Uncle GeoffIn Queen's overly cheerful 1979 classic "Don't Stop Me Now" Freddie Mercury confidently sings "I'm travelling at the speed of light". According to Einstein's theory of relativity this would require an infinite amount of energy and would give Mr Mercury an infinite mass at which point he would certainly perish.In the same verse he sings that he is "burning through the sky [at] 200 degrees". This appears to contradict the other statement about his velocity as he would certainly be much hotter than that if he was travelling anything close to the speed of light particularly if it was through a non-vacuum medium such as the Earth's atmosphere - "the sky".Even if his acceleration only warmed him to 200 degrees it would still be perilous no matter which scale is used - in the Kelvin scale 200 degrees is too cold! In the next line we are meant to infer he is using the Fahrenheit scale. At such a temperature he would certainly perish.Why couldn't Freddie Mercury ask his physicist bandmate Brian May for advice before writing such an unscientific song?YoursHerbert SnailHemel Hempstead

Think again! The Bruins of Westwood are headed for their fourth consecutive 0-3 season opener when they collide with Hawaii on Aug 28.Oh you say that the Bruins actually won one of the first three games last year. That was a virus fluke caused by Utah's cancellation due to an infection on their team. That put the Cal Bears on as a replacement - and most anyone could beat the Bears last season - or any season in recent years. No UCLA's 1-2 opening last year bears - an appropriate verb here - an asterisk indicating it really was an 0-3 start as in 2018 and 2019.Hawaii the Bruins opening opponent this year does well at the start of a season and could upset the pre-game favorite Bruins. LSU will easily take the second game and don't forget that the third matchup is with Fresno State a team that licked the Bruins in 2018 to start the Bruins string of 0-3 losses.Yes there is a new athletic director but the head coach remains on the job. Another 0-3 start may have him packing.Westwood Village UCLA Campus. Woof Bluster with an SOS for Spoof On Sports.

It would seem that during this Afghanistan debacle you would want her by your side to support you.”POTUS: “I told her to pack as many of her pantsuits as she could and take Air Force Two for a long trip to nowhere.

Definitely not the same guy who was once married to Marlyn Monroe. He was the playwright with the first name of Arthur. And there was also author Henry Miller.Oh yes Stephen Miller was in the Trump administration and is reputed to have caused the present bottle-neck at Kabul Airport for Afghans in need of Visas. These Afghans were technical advisers and translators for the U.S. military journalists and NGOs during the 20-year war in Afghanistan.Why would Stephan Miller a Trump administration member not advance Visas during Trump’s four years in office? If not provided with a Visa for a fast exit they could be killed if caught by the Taliban.The reported short answer for Stephen Miller’s lack of action? Racism. The translators and technical advisers were brown. Same Stephen Miller was also behind placing babies and children into cages at the U.S. Mexican border. More brown.White is the only Trump color.Visas for these Afghans is the new knee on the neck for a non-whites.But there is more goon-ism. Texas Lt. Governor Dan Patrick blamed the Covid surge on: “African Americans who have not been vaccinated.”Chi-wah-wah that’s nuts!This same guy previously blamed the spike of Covid on undocumented immigrants crossing the border. Brown again.Jesus Christ was a brown Palestinian. He wasn't a blue-eyed blond.Read more by this author:

The hope is that just the possibility that could happen will entice many of the still unvaccinated to get pricked.According to a person familiar with the discussion but speaking off the record as they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly the CDC will distribute “a bulletin that suggests a possible side effect of the vaccine is follicle regeneration as well as enlarging of the male penis during intercourse.”Reportedly results of the study of the campaign’s targeted audience of testosterone driven white males found that many were easily misled lack fundamental reasoning skills and own an average of six or more guns. However initial trials are said to have also determined that while the subjects refused to take a shot proven to prevent a slow and horrible death many didn’t hesitate to roll up their sleeves if there was a chance to add something up top and down below.“At this point” said the high ranking official “everyone at the CDC is in agreement that the end justifies the means if it gets more vaccines into arms. It’s been clinically shown time and time again that the only way to manage a pandemic is through vaccinations. But here we are practically begging people to save themselves. What a country.”The announcement is scheduled to first be released through media outlets including Fox News The Fox Network Fox Deportes FX FXX The New York Post and the Cartoon Network. It will also be promoted at upcoming MMA matches NASCAR fitness centers and in supplement stores.When asked if there was any data at all supporting the CDC‘s claims the source said that while there is no proof that the vaccine would restore hair and compensate for male insecurity there’s no proof it won’t.“People are going to believe what they want to. And that” they added “is how we’re going to play it.”

Joe Biden spoke the truth about getting U.S. troops out of a twenty-year war on the other side of the world. But unfortunately there appeared to be no planning for the U.S. exit. Biden's dog Major might have been better able to hold back the Taliban during the U.S. exit.Not only did the United States leave billions in military equipment including rockets and missiles Humvees tanks radar systems for ground and air (forget guns and bullets they’re a dime a dozen) the U.S. also closed down the Bagram Airbase back in July. Nice exit planning.Seeing photographs of people herded into those huge transport planes in Kabul and then sitting on the floor must have been a traumatic experience. Forget seat belts. Tightly wedged together squeezed against one another they are one another’s seat belts. And those people were the lucky ones.Others were scrambling on top of the plane desperate to leave only to fall reminiscent of those souls desperate to leave the flames and to jump from the Twin Towers.This war started because of the Twin Towers tragedy. And so it finishes.Many are blaming Donald Trump for the exit plan he started while in office. While Trump’s plan was flawed Biden should have corrected it.Read more by this author:

He bee-lined for a local supermarket where he slipped in the open back door. A supermarket worker was having a ciggy outside and did not notice the huge 4-foot log python doing a slippery move towards the fresh poultry department!Luckily a shop assistant noticed a fresh chicken being devoured by Monty she screamed! The whole shop was evacuated as Monty's owner still stoned rushed to the scene as punters rushed in the opposite direction!Animal protection services were called to the scene as Monty after his tasty snack slipped into a huge aquarium holding live non-boiled lobsters for a quick swim.Monty's owner was allowed in the supermarket after claiming his python had 'done a runner!' He told the animal protection officers that Monty was quite harmless but he surmised that a diet of dead rats mice and unfortunate sparrows was not quite up to a hungry ex-stripper's python's standard!Monty is now in Adelaide zoo and his owner has been arrested for being a pot-headed exotic animal abuser. He is claiming innocence because when he received Monty from a local pot-dealer the dealer promised him free marijuana if he looked after his beloved python purchased from a local retired striptease dancer whose 'pussy' has now closed for business! (Use your smudgy fantasy for that one!)

Having spent nearly six years in Vietnam leading SEAL Teams on their secret missions he was known as the “White Mamba” by the Vietcong who feared him like the plague.Through his connections he heard that a group of American war veterans were going to Kabul on a secret mission to save hundreds of Afghan Special Forces troops and their families who helped them in the war but have now been left for dead by President Biden as the US withdraws from Afghanistan.Although now over 80 years old Smuckmeister still blackens his face and carries a SOG SEAL TEAM ELITE Survival Knife when he visits his local pub in Beaver Crossing. Fearing that he might be followed home by one or more elderly screen scratchers he would sneak out of the bar and take different routes home to avoid them.Having not seen action for over three decades he was excited to join with the special op soldiers that included retired Green Berets and SEAL Team commanders who launched the mission after hearing one of the Afghan commandos they served with contacted them to say he was on the run from the Taliban. His visa had not been approved when the Taliban took over on August 14 and thousands ran for the airport.After secretly flying into Kabul Smuckmeister and the special ops soldiers first devised a system with US troops at the airport where they sent their comrades to a gate and told them to identify themselves with the password 'pineapple' to be put on a plane by the Marines on the ground.After successfully getting hundreds through that way the special ops teams started going into Kabul behind enemy lines to rescue more of their comrades and their families in the cover of darkness.It's unclear how long they have been in Afghanistan and how they got there but some of those involved explained they simply could not leave their comrades behind. They are but one of several ad-hoc volunteer groups on the ground that are frantically trying to save people before time runs out.Glossary: Screen Scratcher: A highly sexed cougar who follows an unsuspecting inebriated male home and scratches on his bedroom screen asking him to let her in.Dr. Slim: “I have known Elmer for years; never had an inkling that he was a SEAL.”Dirty: “Yo Dr. Dude.

He didn't reveal too much other than a nervous twitch and an uncontrollable perspiration problem but Mister G (real name Gary Crippen home address 428 4th Street South St. Petersburg Florida) did tell me what else the space station has in store for the next so-called 'supply run'."Yea yea this is some serious stuff ya know?

How are we gonna do that?! What'supwiththat?!"Indeed. What is up with the I.S.S. when they need information about Shrewsbury???Luton is where all the troublemakers are!

Yuk.So why not use the privacy of a men’s room? Maybe it’s too far away and being ambidextrous is speedier. Speedier may also be why he suffered dripping hair color at a previous news conference. He may do his hair coloring with the same speed. What next? Clipping his fingernails? More yuk. Pray never his toenails. Triple yuk!Now there must be barber shops at JFK. No need for the whiskers in the Lobster Bisque. And Giuliani Donald Trump’s former lawyer can’t claim using an electric shaver while eating in a restaurant is the same as a lady adding lipstick after a meal.Still the internet has old photographs of Donald Trump kissing pal Giuliani while pal Giuliani was dressed in drag. And more recently scenes with Giuliani in the latest Sacha Baron Cohen film Borat 2.Lots more yuks there!Read more by this author:

The reasoning is Afghanistan must be invaded by someone and Switzerland felt they had to get into the action before Canada or Finland.And besides what else does Switzerland have to do all day besides made chocolates cheese and clocks? The country has always been too peaceful and Afghanistan needs a war. War is Afghanistan's GDP.With the announcement of an imminent invasion by Switzerland the Taliban was quietly relieved: “Whew! Thank goodness and just in time. What else can a Taliban fighter do? Get a 9 to 5 job? Wear a tie? Punch a time-clock?"Get real! Taliban fighters can’t just stand around the streets all day admiring their rifles and picking on women? We'll be waiting for you Switzerland. Give us a try.”Afghan women are quietly considering other options. What if women began using their telephones? Have family meals delivered by Door Dash? Also could groceries arrive by Uber? Women can even step up their game and convert rooftops into spas for all the ladies staying at home.A war would also be so refreshing re-boot for Switzerland. So long thought of as a war-free neutral zone when has Switzerland ever done anything really really stupid?And Afghanistan is where Switzerland sees a ripe opportunity to jump into the war game. England fought wars in Afghanistan. Russia did as well. And don’t forget the little guy’s MISSION ACCOMPLISHED banner that led the USA into a twenty-year war in Afghanistan.Switzerland is moving fast mobilizing their fondue equipment feeling it’s the right time to get into a war. However they also fear another nation like Scotland or Nepal might jump into the gap and snatch an Afghan war from Switzerland.They could also make Afghanistan the Switzerland of the Middle East.Read more by this author:
Wednesday 1 September 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/153860/neurologist-senior-members-of-gop-should-have-heads-examined,Neurologist: Senior Members Of GOP Should Have Heads Examined,A leading authority of neurology believes some leaders of the Republican Party should have their heads examined for signs of cerebral damage much like those performed post mortem on athletes suspected of having Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE).Doctor John U.B. Lyien Director of Neuroscience and Behavioral Research at Barnyard University finds that like the deteriorating social and cogent behavior of people subjected to repeated blows to the brain “members of the GOP leadership are displaying increasing signs of impaired cerebral function that points to underlining causes.“Unlike athletes or their families and friends who have become aware of the obvious deterioration of their mental state upper leadership of the GOP and those around them seem to show little or no awareness of their condition.”He went on to say that he’s not comparing the crippling effects of CTE to the recent outbreaks of troubling conduct by members of the GOP. However Lyien said “it’s important to find out if it’s a neurological condition that is causing their outbreaks of bizarre fact free public statements revisionist history and radically shifting principles. Or is their behavior a result of just blatant self-interest.”Lyien doesn’t expect it to be easy to persuade Republicans such as Ted Cruz Lindsey Graham Kevin McCarthy Rudy Guillani and a couple of dozen other party members to step forward for a psychological examination let alone volunteer to have their brains plucked poked and pickled.“But” says Lyien “we need to know the science behind it and we need to find out if it can be managed with isolation and drug therapy. We also have to determine if it affects only entitled smug white politicians or could it spread to the general population.”Dr. Lyien’s previous work includes an examination of unethical behavior in the Catholic Church The Boy Scouts of America and the Houston Astros.

Wednesday 1 September 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/world/153857/toyota-using-ass-kicking-taliban-in-new-ads,Toyota Using Ass-Kicking Taliban in New Ads,Tokyo Japan - The Toyota Motor Corporation unleashed a new commercial today marketed towards Authoritarian regimes and Dictators around the globe.The commercial plays heavily on the recent success of the Taliban in Afghanistan. A victory that conquered its foes using exclussively Toyota products."We are very humbled and proud to see so many '84 Four Runners still doing so amazingly well!" expressed Himzo Yakuchi Toyota's head of marketing to Dictators. "Imagine what the Taliban could accomplish if they had access to any of our vehicles made within the last 20 years!" he gleamed. "With Toyota TRD technology. Go Turd!"Indeed in the ads using all real news footage weapons of destruction could be seen bolted to every make of old Toyota one could imagine. "Look a good old SR-5" beamed Yakuchi. "So proud" he said with a fist pump.Yakuchi admitted that he had become addicted to watching the fighters using his company's products in such glorious fashion. "I watch so much now I want to be in oppressive regime too!" said Yakuchi. He later retracted this comment but still found himself enormously enamored by the Taliban's swift defeat of anything resembling an Afghan Army."They kicked major ass in a Toyota!" the advertisement asserts at the end. "That tag line was my idea" said Yakuchi proudly."We will ride the Taliban's big successes in Afghanistan to be supreme ruler of old pick up trucks!" said Yakuchi who was wise enough to know that when these regimes finally do get their hands on some real cash they will come calling. "We are already getting calls from The Congo The Philippines and The United States. All asking about our products for their guerrilla warfare needs. Very vey proud day for Japan. So very very proud."Yakuchi then started bowing and crying so hard at his country's very proud successes that we had to leave him in his office for the next few hours. When we came back he was still crying and watching Taliban fighting videos on Youtube again. So we left him alone and headed for the airport. Sadly in a Toyota sedan. I had been somewhat hoping for a ride in the back of a rusty old pick-up truck.

Friday 3 September 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/153874/president-joe-biden-commander-in-sheep,President Joe Biden Commander-In-Sheep,BILLINGSGATE POST: Chances are if you see Joe Biden wear a sheepish grin there must be a story behind it. Well there just might be.Much has been written about why men turn to sheep for affection while undergoing stress. In fact Geoffrey Chaucer dedicated a full chapter of The Canterbury Tales to this subject. There are some who say that The Wife of Bath was actually a woman in sheep’s clothing.Some might recall the song by Johnny Mathis “Chances Are.”Chances are ‘cause I wear a silly grinThe moment you come into viewChances are you think that that I’m in love with you.Could it be that this melancholy song was about Biden’s penchant for a woolly lover long past?Who knows?While campaigning in Montana there were whispers - just whispers mind you - of candidate Biden sneaking off into the night for a secret rendezvous with a sheep. It is no secret that desperate men will do desperate things while traveling over the horizon beyond their wife’s eyesight.Horace Hogfelter owner of the eponymously named Hogfelter Hardware in Billings Montana claims that he sold a Montana Pole to Biden. Now let me tell you no one buys one of these contraptions for other than prurient purposes.The original patent for the Montana Pole was issued in 1902 to a hapless sheepherder named Robert Minderbinder. If the name looks familiar it might be because a major character in the Joseph Heller novel Catch-22 was Milo Minderbinder who might have been the grandson of Robert.But I digress and will continue to do so.As defined by The Street Dictionary: The Montana Pole is a purposeful instrument made from a discarded pitchfork handle with a mirror attached to one end. While dangling in front of a sheep’s head the mirror registers the pleasure of the sheep while he is being poked from behind by a lonely sheepherder.Dr. Slim: “With the evolution of social media is nothing sacred anymore?”Dirty: “Yo Dr. Dude. Keep in mind that wackos like us are out there.”

Saturday 4 September 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/153875/pinocchio-the-puppet,Pinocchio The Puppet,The best version:Long ago an old satanist named Geppetto was caught shoplifting in a store in his village. He was sent to a dungeon where he was tortured. His hands were put in an iron vise and afterwards fire ants were placed on them while he screamed.At his home in the woods he prayed to Satan to give him a boy that he could use to commit crimes for him. Satan appeared to him in a vision and told him to cut down a tree in a graveyard for executed convict's. Satan instructed him to chop off a six foot log from the fallen tree then he should take it to his workshop. He then was suppose to carve a wooden boy out of the log so that Satan's demon Beelzebub can live in the puppet.Geppetto carved a puppet in the shape of a boy and named him Pinocchio. He wished the boy to be alive. Satan heard his words and fulfilled his wish. He added life to the puppet. He then told Geppetto to burn the puppet a year later on Christmas day on a satanical alter to prevent a curse from falling on Geppetto.Pinocchio was quite naughty and rarely spoke the truth.Geppetto invented a devilish scheme where he put Pinocchio in a gift box and left him at people's front doors. Villagers gave Pinocchio to their children as a toy. The next morning they woke up to find their valuables and food missing with the lifeless looking puppet nowhere to be found.With thousands of homes being robbed people refused to accept the puppet believing it was bad luck. Geppetto had no choice but to change his method of theft.Pinocchio always promised his school teacher to be a good boy but he soon forgot his word and left the school with his friends to steal things from a local store and to pick pocket unaware villagers. He would bring Geppetto everything he stole. Geppetto's bank account grew to five million pounds.Geppetto would often sell the lifeless looking puppet to lonely men to keep them company. The next morning the men would wake up to find all the money in their wallets missing with no sign of the puppet anywhere.The local church in the village was set on fire and a woman reported seeing a small person dressed in a black hooded cloak running out of the burning church carrying a small chest full of money. He yelled the words "Hail Satan!" She heard the sound of wooden shoes as the small person ran away.A Dutch migget who owns the only pair of wood shoes in the village was arrested the next day and he was tortured in the local dungeon. His hands were crushed in a vise and his feet were burned with red hot coals.One day Geppetto heard about a sunken ship off shore named the "Santa Maria." It carried a large treasure when it went down. He immediately went to find Pinocchio telling him to bring the treasure.As Pinocchio swam upward to a waiting boat carrying a bag full of gold coins a large whale swallowed him and left into the deep sea taking the puppet forever.A year later Geppetto had a horrible nightmare where he frolicked on the grass with Pinocchio and as both of them laughed he sat on the puppet's face and said "Don't be greedy Pinocchio please tell me a lie!"Upon waking from the terrifying nightmare Satan appeared to Geppetto telling him it was Christmas day. He asked him to burn the puppet in a fire so his demon can return home to hell. Geppetto told Satan that Pinocchio got lost at sea. Satan got angry and put a curse on Geppetto telling him that if daylight were to ever touch him he would become a sleeping wood puppet. To break the curse Pinocchio would have to return so the demonic puppet could be burned in a fire.Geppetto spent ten years being careful not to be out during the day. He would leave at night to steal vegetables chickens and corn from local farmers.One day Geppetto went out at night and he found a bottle of moonshine liquor in a farmer's barn. He drank the moonshine and stole a bag of potatoes. On his way back home he felt tired and drunk and he laid down to rest.When he woke he could see a grayish blue color in the air and he knew morning was coming. He ran home as quickly as possible but the sunshine fell on him and he dropped to the floor as a wood puppet.A woodcutter looking for firewood noticed the man sized puppet on the ground. He searched the pocket's of the puppet and found a bag of gold coins. He decided to take Geppetto home to use him as firewood in his chimney.The End

Sunday 5 September 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/features/153888/how-old-people-are-screwed-by-computers,How old people are screwed by computers,Everyone knows that old people and computers don't mix. The case of the absconded email password illustrates exactly how the curdling takes place orchestrated by big tech.This is the notorious case of Miss Wiggins an old maid who lives alone and has tried mightily to keep up with "technology". She even acquired an iTampon many years ago and in fact so many years ago that the battery is almost dead in it. But it still works with her trusty PoutLook email account. Of course Miss Wiggins forgot her email password years ago but her trusty iTampon always signs her in.The new iTampon from Asspple Computers to replace the dying iTampon came just two days ago! How thrilled she was to be able to transfer all of her data from her old to her new iTampon so easily with the help of the Asspple operating system!And it all worked on the new iTampon just like the old iTampon and the battery seemed quite healthy on the new iTampon. (She began to wonder if she would have to buy a new car if her battery started to die? She'll have to ask the car salesman).O but there was one little gotcha. The new iTampon did not know the password for the PoutLook email account. No worries! The website to recover the account just wanted her to fill in the last four digits of her associated phone number which she did. Then it sent a text to her landline. This text went nowhere.So she used the other approaches to recover the account. But they all needed the passwords in fact several of the passwords she previously used even though she only had the one the one that she forgot.She was stuck. So she contacted Asspple. They explained that they did not trust her or her new iTampon with the password for her PoutLook account so they just stored it in a form that could not be used by her or her new iTampon. Only her old dying iTampon could use it.So Miss Wiggins wondered: if she called Century Blink could she get text-to-landline to work on her phone? Alas the robot told her to look on the website and there was no such feature. So Tinymush’s text messages to her landline ended up in a landfill somewhere in China.But then she found the answer. For just 44 dollars a month a company can get your landline to receive text messages and convert them to voicemails!Then the code from Tinymush to restore her PoutLook email account can be obtained and she can reset and actually KNOW her password! And not a single human at Asspple or Tinymush will need to raise a finger which they would not do anyway of course.But alas Miss Wiggins does not have 44 dollars a month. She has decided to burn all of her big tech gadgets and move to a rain forest in South America to raise poisonous vipers.Because all the bastards that she raised work at high tech corporations she figures snakes will be an improvement.

Of course many would prefer he spoke neither now or then. But he thinks he has something to say. Unfortunately Trump's most recent something to say praised Confederate General Robert E. Lee after Lee’s statue was craned away. Trump in effect cried “Boo hoo.”Trump lamented that the U.S. didn’t have any great generals leading the war in Afghanistan like General Robert E. Lee. If we had a General Lee today the U.S. would have beaten the Taliban.He’s calling all the Generals who fought in Afghanistan pussies. This from the bone spurs victim.Trump presents questions: Does he think the south and General Lee won the Civil War? Why is Trump okay with traitors?And why are pro-lifers always pro-war? War means killing not just your own but the other side as well? Both sides who fight have beating hearts one can detect.President Biden is pro-choice but he is anti-war. Same with former President Obama. Texas Governor Greg Abbott however is a saber-rattling pro-war enthusiast but is also pro-life. Isn’t that the height of hypocrisy?How can anyone be pro-life and pro-war? The same person can not hold both positions. Why would pro-lifers enact laws to protect a form of tumor half the size of a lentil but view a fully grown living person as okay to kill?It’s all just a power grab to keep a woman in the kitchen etc. but let them keep their shoes.Read more by this author:

Let me have a shot between the eyes and get rid of my 11's.Guns have killed more people this year than those who have died after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine. Yet guns are okay with the anti-vax protestors.While anti-vax people protest that mandating the Covid vaccine is invasive and that it is intrusive to stick a needle in their arm they also claim Biden is taking away their freedoms. The very same people are okay with Texas law going straight up and into a woman’s uterus deciding and making it the law when that woman may or may not terminate a pregnancy.Just a very large teaspoon of hypocrisy?Texas law limits the termination of a pregnancy to 5 weeks.You know that law had to have been written by a man. Duh! The same law exists whether a woman is the victim of rape or incest. More duh!So if a relative rapes a child that child should head straight to the clinic before those 5 weeks are up.Texas is Texas but the greater travesty is that the U.S. Supreme Court was okay with that Texas law. The Supreme Court gave the law its stamp of approval with a 5 to 4 vote.Like a shot between the eyes.Read more by this author:

The eloquence of President Biden and that of all the former living presidents on the 20th Anniversary made Donald Trump’s predictable babbling sound and smelled like last week’s garbage. Trump used the solemnity of the occasion to refer to President Biden as a “fool.”Trump’s appearance was also sloppy. Wearing a red tie on the anniversary of 9/11 was like wearing an orange sombrero at a funeral. The guy doesn’t understand decorum. Like the word Nobel he probably also can’t spell the word.During his babbling he ranted about President Biden’s act in pulling out of Afghanistan. He described Biden by using the word weak. Weak is the same word he uses to describe people who wear masks against Covid.Apparently Trump doesn’t realize that when he claimed to have bone spurs to avoid serving in Vietnam he confessed to being a weak sister draft-dodging feeble-minded coward.President Carter 96 did not make any of the 9/11 ceremonies. Instead he and former First Lady Roslyn Carter observed the day in their home.From Texas former President George Bush compared the terrorists of 9/11 to the violent extremists who stormed the Capitol on June 6th.Trump called them patriots.Queen Elizabeth wrote that her thoughts and prayers remain with the victims survivors and families affected as well as the first responders and rescue workers called to duty. Bravo!The red tie should have faded and the orange sombrero wilted but Trump went on to narrate a prizefight.Read more by this author:

Newsom sees his victory as an overwhelming mandate for his failed policies.The supporters of the leading Republican nominee Larry Elder see media bias and voting irregularities. Never mind that about 64 percent of voters supported Newsom. Elder lost by more than 2.5 million votes.A dispassionate observer might see the result as hardly surprising given that the alternative to Newsom was Elder who is a right wing radio host and political neophyte. It would seem that California can certainly do better.Donald Trump however has a different interpretation:“Larry Elder tried to distance himself from me. That was a serious strategic mistake. He did not want my endorsement. I did not campaign for him. Is it any wonder that the San Francisco sissy boy won going away? Had Elder sought my help millions and millions of Californians from all over the state who stayed home would have voted and he’d be governor.Trump went on:“America needs my leadership now more than ever. Unfortunately it will have to wait until 2025 but I promise it will be worth it. In the meantime I will continue to run the Republican Party and endorse wonderful candidates--intelligent insightful individuals who agree with everything that I say and do.”In short it’s politics as usual.

Marmaduke Milley single-handedly took secret action to limit President Trump from potentially launching nuclear weapons on China.This report was based on “Peril” a new book by Woodward and Costa which they said relied on interviews with 200 sources and is due to be released next week.In a number of calls General Marmaduke sought to assure General Li Zuecheng of the People’s Liberation Army of China that it wouldn’t be necessary for him to practice putting his head between his legs to kiss his ass goodbye because he Marmaduke would alert him ahead of time.Marmaduke who is now in the doghouse also was also quoted saying ‘I agree with you on everything’ when Nancy Poozleosi called Trump ‘crazy’ after the Capitol riot on January 6.This alone should keep the white-jacketed interns with the giant butterfly nets busy as they chase down these wackos in Washington.Dr. Slim: “I don’t know where to start.

Immediately the Nazi scientists measured the heads of their Sherpas believing they were much more big-headed than those carrying their luggage up the mountains. After analysing their findings and realising that Sherpas had much bigger heads and brains they shot them!Deciding foolishly and pig-headedly to continue their expedition up 8000-meter mountains without guides convinced the Master Race was invincible they ended up in a snowstorm at 4000 meters and started praying to their Messiah Adolf to come and save them. But he was too busy drinking cognac with Chamberlain.After freezing their nuts off in a cave a huge Yeti appeared in a Fata Morgana. So with a feathered quill pen and a piece of frozen papyrus nicked from a monastery on the way they decided to measure the head of the Yeti. Albeit the Yeti was not a real one but their pea-brains were so frozen it did not matter.Luckily the Nazi scientists froze their butts off and were buried by huge drifts of snow and ice blowing in from the Russian Tundra a lose-lose situation.A recent Himalayan expedition in 2020 peeped into the cave and due to global warming discovered 3 preserved mummies of the Nazi scientists plus their amazing discovery written on papyrus that a Yeti has a much larger brain than the Aryan Race could ever possess.Before the German Election Angie Merkel has issued the findings to the German press confirming the fact that Nazis are fucking bone-heads and a Yeti is like Einstein in comparison!AFD German ultra-right-pea-brained-party fighting the election have condemned the news as fake and are convinced that Hitler has been reincarnated as a Yeti and will soon rule the world!

All it took was for Democratic election officials in three counties - L A San Francisco and Alameda - to double the vote count and they 'won.'"In the real California populated by birth-right citizens and not by illegal aliens I won easily. Look at the vote in Inyo Alpine and Del Norte counties. Overwhelmingly for me!"When asked that if he was right wouldn't it be uncovered in the required audit of votes Elder replied: "Democratic election officials in those counties know how to cover up their fraud. No it won't be ex posed. That's why we need really drastic election laws in California like those Texas just passed. Then we'll win."Elder's attorneys filed suit to overturn the election five minutes after the major networks declared the recall had lost.

We’ve got him strapped to a chair and he can’t reach any nuclear buttons.”With clicking chip-sticks China said “Got it.”Caramba that’s hot!So Trump’s echo chamber (in the House Senate and Fox News) call General Milley’s actions treasonous! But they’re okay with Trump’s insurrection attempt at the Capitol on January 6th.The truth is that Donald Trump was unceremoniously dropped kicked out of the White House by most voters and replaced by Joe Biden.Trump enlisted Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the election by refusing to certify it.

Then word went out to hang Mike Pence. A hangman’s scaffolding was erected in the Capitol. The hunt went on for Mike Pence.

If you haven’t a dream to begin with how can you ever have any dream come true?Oscar Hammerstein II asked the same question writing the lyrics of Happy Talk for the musical South Pacific.Today whoever can afford it can travel to outer space and they don’t have to go through the rigors of astronaut training or even have a pilot's license. So the right stuff in the future will be money and plenty of it.Next dream for Elon Musk? Commercial flights on SpaceX for trips around the backside of the moon.And plenty of that right stuff.Bon voyage!Read more by this author:

Mrs. Trump took a trip to the Mexican border wearing a green jacket. Printed on the back of the jacket in sloppy white letters was: I don't care do you?Lots of criticism continued about the meaning of the jacket's message. Maybe Melania Didn't care or her feeling was So what? or perhaps Get me out of here.After she visited the border Mrs. Trump's office stated that the children looked happy and well-fed. Also their cages did not have dirt floors like their homes.At the latest Vogue Met Gala Representative Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez wore a white strapless tuxedo evening gown. On the back of her dress written in bright lipstick red was printed Tax the Rich!Sweet!The rich didn’t agree—lots of criticism about the meaning of that suggestion. The rich claimed that boo hoo they already paid taxes.Hold it there. Apply the brakes.Melania’s husband gave the top 3% of US taxpayers a gigantic delicious tasty tax break which US House Representative Ocasio-Cortez may have been addressing.Perhaps Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez should borrow and wear Melania’s green jacket with the message in back reading I don't care do you? But add So pay up!Read more by this author:

The mandates! The mandates!We've got to have the mandates! the mandates! the mandates!At The Museum of Modern Art an anonymous crooner amazingly similar to Tony Bennett will intone:I left my arm in San FranciscoHigh on a hill it calls to meI'm jabbed and anxiousAbove the windy seaNewsom had faced five previous attempts to remove him with prior efforts falling short.Review:A petition needs 1.5 million signatures and this time the Secretary of State verified 1.7 million signatures of 2.1 million overall.22 million Californians received ballots for the vote September 14.They chose either Yes or No to the question on whether to recall the governor.If Yes they then selected from 46 candidates.The list of candidates to replace Newsom included 24 Republicans 9 Democrats 10 No Party Preference candidates 2 Green Party and 1 Libertarian.Analysts note that although the positions on controlling the virus are very different the campaign songs could apply to either.However musical performance is so heart-warming cheering up current political developments is almost certain.

It took us years to get where we are just imagine if alligators ate everybody up? It’d be bad.”With over twenty-two million social media followers Minaj says she’ll do all she can to be heard: “I don’t need Twitter to get the message out. “Twitter can just wake they crusty ass up. Fuck Twitter. I’m going to talk about science. That’s what it’s all about talkin’ and science. A lot of young girls listen to me to get their science and that’s what I intend to talk about. Dr. Fauci he old too. He can just go away. I’m gonna have callers and they’ll ask me questions live. I’m gonna give them the straight up facts about science. Anything they wanna talk about from vaccines to boobies we’ll talk about it.”Minaj continued: “I ain’t goin to shut the fuck up. Strong women they don’t shut up. Women we show our vaginas to each other. We like hey bitch look at this. I’m not stopping till every person in the world has looked at heard about my vagina. Not like that but it’s like a metaphor.

French mothers have also been invited to throw their childen's toys out of their prams.This far-reaching decision comes at the end of a tense week which saw Paris recall its ambassadors from Australia and America and threaten to withdraw its ambassador from UK also but not do it. French newspapers have been unanimous in their condemnation of the three countries after it was announced that they would set up a new military alliance called Aukus which stands for Australia UK and US.Nobody is certain as to why the French are so annoyed. Some believe that the French felt they should have been invited to join the pact. After all France has saved the world from Germany practically single-handed in two World Wars. Others suspect that Paris is a bit miffed that a lucrative defence contract to build submarines for Australia has been cancelled. However it has been pointed out that the contract has taken twice as long as bargained for costs have almost doubled France still hasn’t delivered a single submarine and the submarine designs are now out of date.The French government has been quick to remind everyone in France that the Jump Up and Down in Anger Day will be next Tuesday at 4pm French time. The last time they held a Jump Up and Down in Anger Day they forgot to post the date and time as a result of which Frenchmen and women started Jumping Up and Down in Anger on different days causing great confusion. However one seasoned veteran of thirty riots and trade union strikes in ten years said "C'était comme n'importe quel autre jour" (“It was just like any other day”).

Perhaps best known for their song "Everlong” Non-Aerosol Air Freshener were the recipients of the first-ever global icon award at the 2021 MTV Video Music Awards.The initial fan reaction to the announcement was mixed.“Why not the Aromatherapy Diffusers?” asked Millicent Abrams one of the band’s fan club members.“Since I heard the news I’ve been trying to figure out how we can change the name of our Facebook fan page” said Rodney Calabasus. “I’m an official administrator on the page so my job is to moderate member comments and ensure the page content is timely. I didn’t go to college to be a computer programmer my associates was in VCR repair. How in the hell I’m going to change the Facebook page name is beyond me.”“I didn’t think the name had anything to do with farts” said Nadine Duckworth.Non-Aerosol Air Freshener guitarist Nate Mendel noted that the name change was a sign of the times.“Ya know some people call it cancel culture and some call it being politically correct I just call it getting a bunch of soccer moms off our asses” said Mendel. “The only thing more annoying than hate mail about our name is the amount of correspondence I receive asking if I’m related to Howie Mandel. Hell they aren’t even spelled the same.”Howie Mandel was unavailable for comment.The band’s announcement which was distributed to the media in the early hours of Tuesday morning noted that including “non-aerosol” as part of their new name was a precautionary measure to ensure that fans concerned with the hole in the ozone layer were not offended.In February 2021 Non-Aerosol Air Freshener released their tenth album Medicine at Midnight.

Thursday 23 September 2021,https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/154021/one-in-five-americans-is-heavily-drinking-alcohol,One in Five Americans is Heavily Drinking Alcohol,One in five Americans is heavily drinking alcohol according to a new survey conducted by The Harris Poll one of the top analytics firms. And it appears Covid may be part of the reason. The study was commissioned by an Irish biopharmaceutical company called Alkermes.In the study seventeen per cent of Americans polled admitted to “heavy drinking” within the previous month. Heavy drinking is defined as a day consisting of four drinks or more for women and five or more for men. This is not the first study to suggest Americans are drinking more these days.Many of the respondents blamed Covid for the spike in drinking saying unemployment and related woes from the Covid epidemic were contributing to stress. However we located a respondent named Toby Nichol. First Toby explained “Oh I’ve been drinking more since the coronavirus happened. A lot me.” But then he sheepishly admitted “To tell the truth that’s mainly an excuse. I’m home all the time might as well drink. Kind of how would you say convenient. I’ve always been a kind of a latent alcoholic. Being laid off from work has presented me with a fantastic opportunity. I mean that Covid’s got to be good for something. You’re gonna have an epidemic you might as well make the most of it.”Of course no individual study is conclusive and the firms involved agree that more study is needed in this important subject. Even the head of Alkermes Richard Pops admits the study may be flawed. “We are Irish” he says “that may have something to do with.” When questioned about what he means by this the spokesman admits “Many of our pollsters showed up at people’s houses with bottles of Irish whisky or vodka and invited the respondents to help themselves. We invite our respondents to help themselves. It loosens them up and everybody knows imbibing makes people more honest. And if our pollsters are drunk it makes them more approachable. People are more likely to respond to a drunk pollster. Hell I’ve been known to drink on the job myself.” He demonstrated by pulling a pint of gin out of his desk and taking a swig. “See” he said “harmless.”As you might guess not everybody thinks this drinking is a problem. Chris R. Swonger a top spokesman of the alcohol industry asked “So what’s the problem here? They want to drink let ‘em drink. I don’t see a problem.”Lawson E. Whiting the president of the Jack Daniels corporation summarized by saying he doesn’t see a problem either: “Look drinking’s not a problem until people do it irresponsibly. We only want people who will drink responsibly. We’ve always encouraged responsible drinking. We want people to drink responsibly and do it in huge quantities. Huge huge quantities.”

That's due in part to conflicting meanings that many words have or the way the sentence is phrased. Here are some prime examples:On the last day of the season and with reporters wondering if Leo Durocher would ink a new contract with the Dodgers or leave the team the Dodger manager said: "I'll resign as manager tomorrow." Is he announcing he's quitting or the renewal of his contract?No bandage is better than a wet bandage. Does that mean you ought to wet your bandage for the best effect? Or if it gets wet you're better off to completely remove it?Headline: Businessman paid millions in bribes. Did he pay them or were they paid to him?More to come!

Next the oversized jacket which hides the expanding waistline—then Trump's grades at Wharton and those legendary tax returns.On his way to the White House he hid his relationship with a porn star and a Playboy bunny paying both ladies hush money. His attorney committed perjury and was sent to jail due to that hide and seek venture.This time Donald Trump is claiming executive privilege to hide and not release telephone records and conversations dealing with his failed coup attempt of January 6th. It seems Trump believes a coup or insurrection is something private like: Does he use orange makeup?More importantly Trump is no longer an executive.The January 6th House Select Committee subpoenaed all of the records Trump is trying to hide and whatever Nancy wants Nancy will get.Trump’s good friend Steve Bannon (under indictment for fraud) said of Joe Biden’s legal Presidential election win “You’ve got to kill that baby in the crib.”Kill that baby... Quite a metaphor to use for a member of the right to life party.Donald Trump will claim executive privilege and refer to the House Select Committee as on a witch hunt. However Trump could have avoided all of this turmoil if he had listened to the people's voice when they said: "You're fired."Read more by this author:

Letting one of God's best creations A Labrador Retriever take care of the problem was ingenious. Full circle. What could be easier? Stick the food scrap under the table and poof! Problem solved. Brilliant.It would be the talk of Glasgow's COP26 climate meeting. Joe couldn't wait to see Greta's reaction. He'd give almost half the credit to Hunter. Well 30% for sure.Why couldn't the border problems be that easy to fix? Biden had been overheard saying during Lab speech rehearsals. Maybe Hunter has better ideas than Kamala for that too? Hunter's best work seemed to come over a bowl of Lucky Charms our sources tell us.Those closest to Biden have often said that Joe thought maybe sometimes his son Hunter was some sort of biblical figure like Noah coming to save them all through his late night party-binge philosophies. Joe has been heard saying that 'Hunter could stare into the swirl of his Lucky Charms like tea leaves and come up with a solution.'Hunter was apparently still disappointed about the second part of his plan not being part of the speech. 'The part about how to dispose of all the dog poop. Like he envisioned' Our confidant confirmed. Biden had nervously contemplated it but ultimately eliminated it at the last minute.Friends say that Hunter has watched 'Cheech n' Chong' way to many times for his own good. "You won't actually get high from smoking dog poop. The world isn't ready for that" confirmed a high school buddy of Hunter. The real Chong also confirmed this theory too."But you have to admire the boy's All-American can-do attitude. You know I think he has ambitions of becoming Ambassador to Jamaica" an anonymous White House staffer overheard Jill saying. "At least he has a Jamaican flag tacked to his wall in the basement" His step mom had noticed.So crank up those puppy mills meth heads in strange states. Papa Joe got some bizness comin' your way.

"It could be he's trying to mentor the youngster but it could be something else entirely” he added ominously.A horde of media members crowded around Belichick when he emerged from his shelter attempting to determine what was going through the coach’s mind at the time.

But I wouldn’t hold my breath.”

They just gonna ride that cowboy boarder guard off into a pretty velvet silhouetted sunset painting...(and help round up some more illegals after the heat wears off in a week or two.)'Just no more goddamn parades.

Biden Admits His Brain Was Cryogenically Frozen,BILLINGSGATE POST: In an interview that will air this Sunday President Biden admits that prior to the election this past November he underwent a cryogenic treatment to preserve the few remaining cells in his brain.When asked by George Staphylococcus why he chose to undergo the treatment he replied; “I don’t know. All I remember was that I was trying to think but nothing was happening.”After recovering from having his head cryogenically frozen at minus 321 degrees Fahrenheit he admitted that there was little difference than before he had the experimental treatment.This is the same procedure that Baseball Hall of Famer Ted Williams underwent so that he might achieve immortality. The Splendid Splinter died July 5 2002. His body was then taken by private jet to Alcor Life Extension Foundation in Scottsdale Ariz. There Williams' body was separated from his head in a procedure called neuroseparation.The operation was completed and Williams' head and body were preserved separately. After being frozen at minus 321 degrees Fahrenheit his head was stored in a steel can filled with liquid nitrogen. After being shaved then drilled with holes the head was then mounted on a Bumblebee tuna can and used for target practice by his caretakers.At the time President Biden was interviewed by Staphylococcus Biden’s brain had not yet reached room temperature even after nearly a year. Asked if he recalled the name of the President he served under while Vice-President he cautiously replied:“I don’t recall. I’m trying to think but nothing happens.”Dr. Slim: “What’s new with that?”Dirty: “Yo Dr. Dude. You nailed it.”

Others find the two personas "entirely consistent."Depicted above Mr. Fauci is apparently more relaxed when he is able to sit back into his @ Alt-Fauci lifestyle persona.This alternative enjoys a bit of a stouter presence (cheeseburgers he says) the long hair and all that which add mystique to his usual buttoned-down presentation in mainstream news.Mainstream scholars are now turning toward Mr. Fauci and the emergence of his alter-ego @Alt-Fauci as an iteration of formerly famous cases such as Jekyll and Hyde.However in this instance Jekyll and Hyde have bonded.Major American universities are moving toward research studies on this matter.Meanwhile In the cozy confines of @Alt-Fauci's office no reporters step forward to challenge statements based on non-existent data."Besides" @Alt-Fauci remarks in defense of Mr. Fauci "that data is sure to surface at any moment. Delays in getting its support to our views is merely the usual techno glitch slowdown of our time. It's not our fault. Bureaucracy is not easy to manage."And:"Would you like a cheeseburger while you're here?"When the diligent reporter noted that @Alt-Fauci's right hand appeared to be offering a gesture of some sort the good doctor responded pleasantly."Partly it's this Buddhist thing I've honored all my life suggesting ultimate harmony if only people will get with my directions on what to do in this pandemic.""Vaccinating the entire globe is definitely possible. At least I certainly hope so given I'm now 80 and time is running a bit short. Plus I'm thinking why not retire for a few years in some exotic place.""I will definitely take my mask collection along for that."Further @ Alt-Fauci guaranteed there was absolutely NO evidence that Mr. Fauci in his regular thinner TV persona had been overheard singing "I need a fix 'cause I'm going down" in his bathroom.Now a delicate question arose.Would Mr. Fauci as @ Alt-Fauci guarantee that he REALLY represents Mr. Fauci's true views?@ Alt-Fauci replied that although a different form of Mr. Fauci he was absolutely loyal and could guarantee credibility on Mr. Fauci's more private ambitions such as retiring to some exotic place to escape reporters' questions."But he may deny this.""I mean the now this now that approach to politics in this country is de rigeur at this point and he has followed it diligently.""However you must also look carefully at that part of the image he uses when pushed too far.""That is you are seeing a curved forefinger very sophisticated and a subtle disguise for the more traditional middle finger. (I believe the French developed it first with Napolean No.1.)""Basically it's directed at the critics after all his guidance during this time of crisis."
