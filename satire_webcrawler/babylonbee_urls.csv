Plus as the twins' mother I drew the short straw and got breastfeeding duty! These babies are keeping me up all hours of the night to breastfeed!"Buttigieg also cited his need for extended bed rest following a difficult labor. "It really did a number on me" he said. "I'm still so tired and hormonal and those varicose veins and stretch marks! So many stretch marks!"Sources later confirmed the varicose veins and stretch marks were unrelated to the new babies.The Buttigieg's confirmed they are supplementing with infant formula since breastfeeding has proven difficult. "We thought there might have been a problem when the babies started losing a ton of weight. Thankfully our house servant María told us about baby formula which really helps!"Buttigieg has suggested in the meantime that port authorities employ the help of Theodore Tugboat and get some bigger choo-choo trains to help clear the supply chain backlog.

But this is even more amazing as the justice pointed out that Epstein was likely murdered."I wanted to make sure Justice Ginsburg was not spreading false information like that" Couric said in defense of her deceptive editing practices. "It would have reflected badly on her and made people think she couldn't do her job. Everyone knows that Epstein killed himself and that's that. Absolutely nothing shady happened there.""Also for the record I do not have any dirt on Hillary Clinton and am in fine mental health."According to the full transcript of the interview Ginsburg said "You know it just doesn't add up. The jail cell tape went missing the guards had some shifty stuff going on. I bet Epstein had dirt on a lot of people that would want him dead. I'm gonna go on the record here and say that Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself."Ginsburg reportedly went on to say other controversial statements that Couric edited out such as "F--- Joe Biden" "Taxation is theft" and "Make America great again."

Bezos informed the hapless pawns in his game that they would compete in a series of children's activities such as red light green light hopscotch and a creation of his own called "Smear the Elon."During the first game terrified contestants learned the hard way that those who lose the games are immediately gunned down. "But wait!" Bezos said as they demanded he let them go. "I haven't revealed the prize yet!" He pressed a button to lower a large piggy bank from the ceiling containing one ticket for the next Blue Origin flight but accidentally pressed the trapdoor button sending himself plummeting into the alligator pit. "Why do I even have that button?" he muttered to himself as he kicked a gator off his foot.Amazon has confirmed that participation in the next series of games will be mandatory for all Americans.

It's what it is."The praise band had been hard at work figuring out how to make the bridge for 'Oceans' last until Deacon Bob's heart failure won out when Kevin was struck with an idea. "What if what if what if what if...I played a different chord as like as like as like as like a transition and then went back to the bridge?"The rhythm guitar player scratched the shock of hair coming out from his toboggan wondering aloud if this was heresy. The bass player said nothing being a phantom of everyone's imagination. The drummer said something profound but it was muffled by his cage. The female vocalist just looked at him longingly wondering if he had noticed her yet for her beautiful inaudible harmonizing. Kevin decided to go for it.Immediately the roof shattered the clouds parted and angels came to bring Kevin into eternal glory. "This is my praise band leader in whom I am well pleased" boomed a voice from on high."There were just no praise songs left for Kevin down here on Earth" said Pastor Terry Stegall of Church On The Rock. "I always said that kid could stretch a song bridge into eternity. I guess he finally did."

This time they’re threatening to release an extremely politically incorrect comedy special.“No topic will be taboo” said the founder of Al-Qaeda Bob Al-Qaeda. “LGBTQ issues — trans issues specifically — racial issues — you will be screaming at the screen ‘No! Don’t go there!’ But we swear by Allah we will go there.”The threat was met with immediate panic in the U.S. “These insensitive jokes could literally get people killed!” screamed one left-wing activist. “We have to stop this! Shut down the internet if we must! And give in to all their demands!” President Biden said he was giving in to their demands as he was “pulling out of Afghanistan as fast as he can” but he’s not sure it will be enough to stop the terrorist word-violence.It’s unknown how the comedy special will be released. It’s possible it will come out on Netflix. “We did release Cuties” said Netflix CEO and founder Bob Netflix. “So it would be pretty hypocritical to draw the line at Al-Qaeda.”The Department of Homeland Security is calling on everyone to be vigilant and to report the sound of laughter since proper sensitive progressive humor should never evoke any other sound than clapping.There are concerns however that the Al-Qaeda comedian will bomb.

The press reported his fashion was "impeccable" and that he looked like an "even hotter George Clooney" but some far-right extremists said that he was actually naked."Is it just me or is the emperor not wearing any clothes?" the boy posted on his social media accounts Thursday. Censors worked quickly flagging his tweet with a warning that it was potentially harmful misinformation. Snopes fact-checked his claim and found that it was "mostly false" as the emperor was wearing socks. CNN dug into his old tweets and found that he tweeted that his best friend Castellan was a "booger head" two years ago.He made his case for the emperor actually being completely naked on his Parler account prompting Amazon to immediately take down all of Parler. The IRS is also looking into his accounts as he had over 600 copper pieces in his satchel and the FBI is going after him as he had a castle Lego set at his home causing some to wonder if he was going to attack the emperor's castle and cause an insurrection.Meanwhile the emperor who is very old and mostly stays in the castle dungeon eating ice cream had his spokesperson Lady Jen Flocky address the controversy. "Hear ye! Hear ye! The emperor is wearing the finest clothes I assure you all" she said. "By his majesty's royal decree anyone who says otherwise will be thrown into the alligator pit!"

"It's not an easy job but someone has to do it. Now if you'll excuse me I have to go meow by my food dish so my humans can move the food around and make it look like there's more food in there than there is." The cat says she is planning on some new moves today including a few parkour tricks like jumping off the walls and kicking over a laundry basket and then fleeing through the house like a bat out of heck. Autumn has also filed a complaint of animal abuse against her owners for only holding the door open for her for seven hours at a time while she decides if she wants to go outside or stay inside.

"We here on the high seas often sing our sea shanties in his honor and pour out rum for such a swell guy.""SQUAWK! SUCH A SWELL GUY!" the parrot on his shoulder repeated.The captain said he and the other ship captains wanted to spell out a different phrase but it was rated "ARRRRR".Experts who know what they're talking about say the catastrophic background has nothing to do with labor shortages due to vaccine mandates or any policy related to President Biden and his highly competent Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg."Hey wow! Look at all those really big boats!" said Buttigieg while visiting the port. "Boats go vroooom! Pretty colors! I like the blue one!" He then went back home to play some Ticket to Ride and Mario Kart to help educate himself on more transportation-related issues.Longshoremen predict they will have the backlog fixed by 2028.

But soon after the whole land became overrun with bothersome giant flies.“This is why I hate adventurers” said the unnamed man who runs the inn in the nearby town of Wolfwater. “They just see some ‘monsters’ and say ‘Hey maybe if I kill that I’ll get some good experience and perhaps it will drop some gold.’ And they never think of the long-term consequences.”“The giant ecosystem — though giant — is very fragile” explained Professor Fizzle who works in the library in Wolfwater. “Why do you think dungeons are overrun with giant rats? Because long ago people killed all the giant cats.”Stormbreaker one of the adventurers who was carrying an improbable sword nearly his own size was unapologetic. “Those spiders attacked us when we were wandering the forest in search of the entrance to the Cave of Shadows” he explained. “What was I supposed to do? Scoop them up in a giant cup?”It is unknown now whether the citizens of Wolfwater will need to import spiders from a neighboring region to restore balance to the ecosystem or if the spiders will respawn if they just wait long enough.

I owe it all to you guys."Tebow still didn't score any touchdowns.

They then proceeded to thoroughly catalog all the excess income collected by the new seven-year-old.Chief Airborne Auditor Alvin “Deduction Strangler” Clarke reviewed the agents’ findings. “Cash payments in the birthday cards alone easily approach the $600 threshold even though Papa Earl and Gigi clearly tried to cheap out with a $15 McDonald’s gift card.”Clarke continued “We also had a trampoline several Barbies and a few Lego sets although we didn’t find the Millenium Falcon that Agent Glenn was really hoping to find for his kids. I mean for the evidence in the case. That’s right. A lot of the time I refer to evidence as ‘Agent Glenn’s kids.’ Why wouldn’t I?”Sally Smithson spent the rest of the day filling out complicated tax forms while the surrounding agents ate her cake and ice cream. “This is an important lesson for a young American to learn” said Agent Clarke. “Remember Sally always check with the government before you do anything.

"In fact it's apparent that pretty much every DC superhero ever written has always been super gay. We thought it was time for a meaningful change to the Batman universe."To introduce some diversity to the almost 100% gay characters of DC Robin will be rewritten as a faithful Baptist deacon from Indiana who has a loving wife and 5 kids and who fights crime in his spare time. He will also patrol universities to own the libs and shut down atheists."Robin the Christian Boy Wonder will roam the streets of Gotham with his gay mentor Batman sharing the good news of Jesus with street thugs and Arkham inmates" Taylor explained. "He is passionately pro-life and even protests outside the abortion clinic from time to time. He'll also have some great catchphrases like 'Holy... is the Lord God Almighty the whole earth is filled with his glory Batman!' We've never had a character like this before."DC said they will be continuing to push inclusion in their comics by introducing some weak female characters to bring some more diversity to their lineup of strong female characters.
'October 13th 2021',https://babylonbee.com/news/breaking-evil-mirror-universe-william-shatner-returns-from-space,"Breaking: Evil Mirror Universe William Shatner Returns From Space",On Wednesday William Shatner the beloved Boston Legal actor famous for portraying attorney Denny Crane traveled to space.Shatner was one of four people aboard Jeff Bezos’s cucumber-shaped Blue Origin rocket as it soared to the edge of the atmosphere offering breathtaking views and a few minutes of weightlessness. The shaft of the eggplant-shaped craft then detached and passengers floated back to earth. The mission seemed to be a success but concerned witnesses said something about Shatner seemed off."He seemed…evil" said another crew member. "And he had a black goatee that really added to his evil look."After attempting to sabotage the next flight by removing the inertial dampeners and randomly attacking a civilian in a red shirt Shatner declared that West Texas where he landed was “now part of the Terran Empire.” When Bezos attempted to congratulate him on his journey Shatner cracked a bunch of bald jokes and mocked Bezos for being only the second richest person in the world.Experts theorize that somewhere in the lower atmosphere the mushroom-shaped vessel encountered a disruption in the space/time continuum and the William Shatner from our reality was replaced by a sinister William Shatner from a parallel timeline. Worst of all the mirror Shatner is almost indistinguishable from our William Shatner save his striking goatee and big thick evil eyebrows.Thankfully the threat posed by evil William Shatner is predicted to be short-lived since like the real William Shatner he is 90 years old. Due to his age he will probably return to the heavens soon and this time not in a bratwurst-shaped spacecraft.

Plus as the twins' mother I drew the short straw and got breastfeeding duty! These babies are keeping me up all hours of the night to breastfeed!"Buttigieg also cited his need for extended bed rest following a difficult labor. "It really did a number on me" he said. "I'm still so tired and hormonal and those varicose veins and stretch marks! So many stretch marks!"Sources later confirmed the varicose veins and stretch marks were unrelated to the new babies.The Buttigieg's confirmed they are supplementing with infant formula since breastfeeding has proven difficult. "We thought there might have been a problem when the babies started losing a ton of weight. Thankfully our house servant María told us about baby formula which really helps!"Buttigieg has suggested in the meantime that port authorities employ the help of Theodore Tugboat and get some bigger choo-choo trains to help clear the supply chain backlog.

"What if what if what if what if...I played a different chord as like as like as like as like a transition and then went back to the bridge?"The rhythm guitar player scratched the shock of hair coming out from his toboggan wondering aloud if this was heresy. The bass player said nothing being a phantom of everyone's imagination. The drummer said something profound but it was muffled by his cage. The female vocalist just looked at him longingly wondering if he had noticed her yet for her beautiful inaudible harmonizing. Kevin decided to go for it.Immediately the roof shattered the clouds parted and angels came to bring Kevin into eternal glory.

It’s possible it will come out on Netflix. “We did release Cuties” said Netflix CEO and founder Bob Netflix. “So it would be pretty hypocritical to draw the line at Al-Qaeda.”The Department of Homeland Security is calling on everyone to be vigilant and to report the sound of laughter since proper sensitive progressive humor should never evoke any other sound than clapping.There are concerns however that the Al-Qaeda comedian will bomb.

The press reported his fashion was "impeccable" and that he looked like an "even hotter George Clooney" but some far-right extremists said that he was actually naked."Is it just me or is the emperor not wearing any clothes?" the boy posted on his social media accounts Thursday. Censors worked quickly flagging his tweet with a warning that it was potentially harmful misinformation. Snopes fact-checked his claim and found that it was "mostly false" as the emperor was wearing socks. CNN dug into his old tweets and found that he tweeted that his best friend Castellan was a "booger head" two years ago.He made his case for the emperor actually being completely naked on his Parler account prompting Amazon to immediately take down all of Parler. The IRS is also looking into his accounts as he had over 600 copper pieces in his satchel and the FBI is going after him as he had a castle Lego set at his home causing some to wonder if he was going to attack the emperor's castle and cause an insurrection.Meanwhile the emperor who is very old and mostly stays in the castle dungeon eating ice cream had his spokesperson Lady Jen Flocky address the controversy. "Hear ye! Hear ye! The emperor is wearing the finest clothes I assure you all" she said. "By his majesty's royal decree anyone who says otherwise will be thrown into the alligator pit!"

The shaft of the eggplant-shaped craft then detached and passengers floated back to earth. The mission seemed to be a success but concerned witnesses said something about Shatner seemed off."He seemed…evil" said another crew member. "And he had a black goatee that really added to his evil look."After attempting to sabotage the next flight by removing the inertial dampeners and randomly attacking a civilian in a red shirt Shatner declared that West Texas where he landed was “now part of the Terran Empire.” When Bezos attempted to congratulate him on his journey Shatner cracked a bunch of bald jokes and mocked Bezos for being only the second richest person in the world.Experts theorize that somewhere in the lower atmosphere the mushroom-shaped vessel encountered a disruption in the space/time continuum and the William Shatner from our reality was replaced by a sinister William Shatner from a parallel timeline. Worst of all the mirror Shatner is almost indistinguishable from our William Shatner save his striking goatee and big thick evil eyebrows.Thankfully the threat posed by evil William Shatner is predicted to be short-lived since like the real William Shatner he is 90 years old. Due to his age he will probably return to the heavens soon and this time not in a bratwurst-shaped spacecraft.

"Human mouth smile and happiness recognized. Deploying snipers." Then a gruesome sight: hundreds of people being gunned down in cold blood.

"This is our top priority right now. Trying to figure out why a rando totally went rogue and fired thousands of rounds out a hotel window on concertgoers back in 2017 has to go on the backburner for now.""What do you want us to do just let parents have opinions unchecked? Not on my watch. We've gotta take these terrorists down."Indeed sources within the FBI have confirmed that the FBI's most-wanted list is entirely parents at this point from Cindy in Ohio to Amy in Wisconsin.At publishing time the FBI had announced they will also "circle back" to BLM rioters Antifa protesters and Hunter Biden "after we've made sure these parents can't hurt school board members with their mean words anymore."

Happens all the time" said Biden. "If China invades Taiwan we'll be sure to get everyone out of there just like we did Afghanistan! And then we'll leave 80 billion dollars of weapons for the Chinese to use as sort of a housewarming gift. It's the least I can do for President Xi after he bought one of my son Hunter's paintings!"The press pool erupted into chaos as Biden was dragged offstage by aides."The president was just kidding" said Psaki. "The U.S. will always remain true to our allies and if we don't we'll just circle back to that later."When the press continued to shout questions Psaki responded by diving out a window.President Xi announced that he can't wait to welcome back the people of Taiwan to the warm and loving embrace of Communism and then murder everyone.

Are you a kid? Are you being raised by normal middle-class parents who love you and care for you? Uh-Oh watch out! They may be dangerous domestic terrorists! It's important to keep a close eye on your parents for suspicious activity so you can report them to the FBI if necessary. Here are 10 troubling signs your parents may in fact be terrorists:1) They make you pray to Jesus instead of Dr. Fauci: This is a clear indication they are anti-science since Fauci IS science blessings be upon his name.2) They ask what you learned in school today: Asking this question shows that your parents don't trust the education experts who are forming your entire worldview. Just answer "nothing" and then call the authorities immediately!3) They say things like: "Let's threaten people and do violent domestic terrorism to them!": If they say this and they're not wearing a BLM t-shirt it's a bad sign.4) They require sunscreen when they go to the beach: This is clear evidence that your parents may be white. If they're white they're automatically dangerous.5) They take away the pornographic queer theory book you borrowed in the school library: If they give you a wholesome Tuttle Twins book instead it's bad news.6) They say racist dog whistles like "this school CRT curriculum seems pretty racist.": Absolutely disgusting.7) You have never seen them dress in drag at a local library: And if they've never encouraged you or any of your siblings to change genders chances are they are dangerous transphobes.8) They don't have a verified blue check on Twitter: Gross. It probably means they work in unsophisticated jobs like plumbing or nursing which are hotbeds of violent domestic terror.9) You can see their entire face when they talk: This means they aren't wearing a mask. They're basically murderers.10) They voted for Trump: The FBI is watching you from outside your door right now. If your parents voted for Trump blink twice. They'll take it from there.Know the signs! And if you see something say something!NOT SATIRE: Don't let the Biden administration the FBI or Cancel Culture win! Here is how the Tuttle Twins is fighting back:The Tuttle Twins children’s book series is teaching the rising generation about the ideas of freedom free markets individual responsibility and American history.It costs roughly $10 to print and distribute one copy of the Tuttle Twins.

"Frankly the other one was getting ignored anyway. At least this time we know women will read it and do exactly what it says." The cars will also display change oil warnings but they will read "Change oil whenever it's convenient for you no rush. You're a busy woman. You do you. #bossmom."At publishing time manufacturers had introduced an alternative warning that reads "Ask your husband to check the engine."

Unfortunately the filming for the video was cut short after Biden wandered on set and started sniffing the kids.According to sources aides had forgotten to lock him in the basement with a snack and Joe's curiosity got the best of him."I just LOVE the idea of EXPLOOOORING the unknown" said Harris in her classic charming way. "Hey wait—JOE! What are you doing Joooeee? Those kids are not for sniffing!""Listen lady I dunno who you are but I sniff whoever I want to!" Joe said grumpily. He then took a large whiff of one of the child actors' heads before being dragged back to the basement for another snack.Filming later resumed but disaster struck again when one of the kids told the Vice President that he was an orphan with terminal cancer causing Kamala to laugh uncontrollably for 30 minutes.

I just can’t live a lie anymore. I just can’t. I am not an Exvangelical. I am not deconstructing. I love the church. I can do no other. God help me.”The scandalous disclosure that he is still a Christian who continues to have a high view of Scripture the Church and Jesus comes at a particularly bad time for the musician as he has recently faced backlash for refusing to play at venues mandating proof of vaccination.It remains to be seen at publishing time if other Christian artists will be inspired by this bold announcement to likewise come out of the shadows and claim the identifier of "still Christian."

This is surprising since Biden has been a complete failure at every aspect of his presidency — the economy protecting the border foreign affairs handling the pandemic — and it’s unclear what those who approve of him think his job is.“Oh yeah good old Joe” said Rufus Reed a plumber who approved of Biden’s job performance. “He works at the local hardware store right? He knows a lot about washers.”Isabel Howard a nurse thought Biden was the guy who mows the grass along the freeway. “It’s never very long” she said. “I don’t know what more you could look for.”Derek Goodman who is unemployed and approves of Biden seemed to have more of an idea who he is. “He’s that guy on TV who does the Grandpa Simpson bit where he just kind of rambles” he said. “I don’t really understand what show he’s on but I see clips of him online. He’s hilarious.”One person was very negative about the current president but just didn’t understand that the president is Joe Biden. “The president is doing a terrible job” said Joe Biden. “Whoever that guy is he’s really screwing up this country. That’s what I was telling everyone at the ice cream shop where I work.” One of Biden’s aides then whispered something in his ear and his eyes went wide. “Oh no!”

According to witnesses the spill was created by California Governor Gavin Newsom swimming in the water for a couple of minutes."This is an environmental disaster" said an EPA spokesperson. "Our sources indicate at least 13% of the world's petroleum is used to make hair gel for Gavin Newsom. He should have known better than to just jump in the water with all that in his hair."Crews will be on hand for several days to clean up the spill and issue medical care to marine life affected by the spill. Already hundreds of volunteers are stationed on the beach helping to clean Gavin's "MEGA-hold" hair gel off seagulls pelicans and otters.In a statement to the press Newsom apologized for polluting the oceans. "I'm only human and I made a mistake" he said. "Plus I'm naturally very oily and greasy. And I only look good with my hair pulled straight back and glued to my head. I shouldn't have just jumped in the water like that where cameras would catch what I was doing."To help protect the environment and reverse the damage from his oil slick Newsom later announced that he was banning all swimming until further notice.

"If your child is unvaccinated he should NOT be given any of the good candy. No Reese's or Snickers or any of that. Candy Corn only. That's it."Beloved NBC anchor Chuck Todd responded to Fauci's recommendation and asked for clarification. "So you mean to say they can ONLY get candy corn? Nothing else?""Well maybe they can have an apple or a carrot or a toothbrush" Fauci replied. "If an unvaccinated kid is given the good candy they may forget their proper station as unvaxxed second-class citizens. And watch out for... THE DROPLETS!" Fauci then shrieked and jumped out a nearby window as it had been a stressful day.The CDC confirmed Dr. Fauci's recommendations before later reversing them due to public outcry and also due to Fauci changing his mind again.

Today on Indigenous Peoples' Day the mayor announced to the press that the statue will be replaced by one of Native American folk hero Elizabeth Warren."For years Chief Warren has been a source of strength and inspiration to the native peoples of the Midwest" said the Mayor. "We honor them today with this 15-foot bronze likeness of the noble Cherokee warrior and tribal elder. She has been fighting for Democrat policies in Washington for many years which have always worked so well for Native Americans."Warren attended the unveiling ceremony where she passed the peace pipe with City Council and then treated them all to a delicious casserole from her native cookbook Pow Wow Chow.The 20-foot-tall Columbus statue has been shipped to Mar-a-Lago for display on Trump's golf course.
'October 11th 2021',https://babylonbee.com/news/democrats-introduce-medicare-for-all-except-the-unvaccinated-bill,"Democrats Introduce 'Medicare For All Except The Unvaccinated' Bill",WASHINGTON D.C.—Many Democrats have been pushing for what they call Medicare for All—making the Medicare program available to every American—for years but the pandemic has caused them to rethink this proposal.“I used to love the idea of universal health care” Senator Bernie Sanders said “but then I realized there are lots of people I don’t want to give health care to so we needed a proposal that reflects that.”Now a number of Democrats have introduced a new bill: Medicare for All Except the Unvaccinated. It’s just like Medicare for All but instead of providing health care for all Americans it explicitly denies health care to anyone who doesn’t get a COVID-19 vaccine.“And it’s very forward-looking” said Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez the world’s smartest socialist “because it has provisions so we can later deny health care to people who don’t get enough booster shots. This is great because while I realized I like giving away free stuff I don’t like giving it to people who don’t do what I tell them.”While initially only the unvaccinated will be denied health care there are proposals to expand that group such as anyone who won’t apologize for voting for Trump or who doesn’t like Critical Race Theory. The hope is that by denying people health care Democrats can get people to change their views. Or those people will die which is just as good.

People are fondly discussing Brandons inviting Brandons to fun parties for cool people and chanting his name at sports games. The Brandon craze is really sweeping the country.""Ah Brandon" he added. "What a swell guy!"Brandons are now out-polling Steves Bobs Gregs and Garys. Brandons are even out-polling Kyles according to some surveys which is unprecedented as typically everyone likes Kyles.There also appears to be a correlation between the approval rating of the president and Brandons with the former's rating dropping harder than an old man falling down some stairs and the latter's rating rising faster than the president jumping up to get some pudding.Everybody still hates Todds.

We always have to play as a female hero or else some 2SLBGTQIAA++ blah blah blah pansy. Whether it's Horizon Zero Dawn or Tomb Raider leftists are always shoving their agenda down our throats. We miss the good ol' days when you were a MALE hero with muscles and a sword—strong independent men like Zelda.So it's with great relief that I booted up Metroid Dread and beheld the hero in the opening cinematic sequence: muscled mysterious macho. He's so manly he doesn't even show his face simply remaining emotionless and stoic behind his hulking tough-guy armor. He blasts robots and alien creatures with the cold calculating intensity only men can muster. A woman would totally freak out in these situations or be unable to make up her mind. The male protagonist here also manages to park his spaceship without running into anything another example of the benefits of having a man star in your video games.The manly character gets cool upgrades throughout the gameplay with a bigger manlier cannon the ability to climb walls and an upgraded suit that lets him withstand the cold—another example of something a woman couldn't do.It was a little weird that the computer voice kept calling our mysterious hero "Lady" right off the bat but I assume that's just playful banter. I admit I didn't quite finish this game yet; I was too excited to finally play a game with a male role model front and center. Plus it was kinda hard. Either way Dread is good enough that I'm excited to go back and play the rest of the games in the series. I assume our hero apparently named Metroid is just as macho and manly in each of those! How did I miss this all these years?

Here in the United States on a work exchange program from Saudi Arabia Facebook programmer Hillahammed Clintahamil claimed that social media needs to censor more free speech and promote only leftist ideas.The media quickly fawned over the brave whistleblower for courageously speaking out about the social network's harmful policy of allowing people to freely socially network. Clintahamil's devastating revelations about Facebook include the claims that the social networking company hasn't banned all conservatives yet and also hasn't forced everyone to follow Joe Biden's page."Facebook letting people like Ben Shapiro say things is very bad yes very bad Allah be praised" Clintahamil said in front of a congressional hearing panel Friday. "Allah will smite those who continue to allow these right-wing people to speak freely. May Mark Zuckerberg see the light of the prophet Mohammed as Allah opens his eyes to the truth that the government must take over Facebook and force them to ban all conservatives."Clintahamil then asked for a recess so he could pray facing Mecca though strangely he appeared to face Epstein's private island instead. Weird!

"If you have no uterus but you are pro-abortion you're totally allowed to have an opinion. In fact if you are a man and you're not loudly and forcefully—in a very masculine way—voicing your pro-choice opinion to everyone in support of abortion you probably hate women."The nation's Democrat men were a little confused after having been told to shut up for the last 50 years but were really thankful Democrat women were now allowing them to talk."So if we say we're cool with killing babies will you let us talk sometimes?" said all the Democrat men."Yeah that's ok now! We need your voice!" said Democrat women.The men suddenly felt conflicted having never been allowed to have an opinion before. Sources say when they actually thought about it they weren't sure if they were cool with killing their own children.When they expressed their opinion that they were no longer sure about abortion Democrat women told them to shut up and sit in the corner again."We will only welcome the opinions of men who completely agree with our radical views on baby-killing" said Pelosi.

And that team is team America and team America is cheering for Brandon.

For each of those massive wooden ships has a cargo hold filled with pumpkin spice the fabled spice of autumn.Pumpkins are only grown on a few mountaintops in Asia. The pumpkins aren’t ready to be dried and ground up into valuable pumpkin spice until the end of September. The rare spice is worth more than its weight in gold though it’s so potent that it’s said that an ounce of it could kill a man (but not a basic white girl). Because of its value many ships brave the dangerous waters to fill up with the spice and return it to the states every year.“Aye ‘twas treacherous waters” said Captain Bellzwigger as he disembarked his vessel with men unloading crates of spice behind him. “We lost two ships this year. So many lives lost — and I don’t even see the appeal of this stuff. But then again I don’t drink lattes.”

She has to go!”The Democrats have put out a want ad to help find a new candidate which reads: “Looking for female willing to be Democratic Senator. Must be good at doing exactly what she’s told without question. Also she can’t make a big deal out of it if we film her in the bathroom.”“Independent women are fine” said Democrat Mitchell Hanson who helped write the ad. “As long as they’re independent in ways we specifically say they’re allowed to be. But when it’s time for an important vote we don’t want some lippy broad who won’t fall in line. That gets in the way of progressivism and feminism.”

The move will reportedly flood Disney with over 500 separate versions of the Fauci doc."You can now enjoy this documentary of America's most important public health servant" said a Disney representative. "Well any one of 500 different documentaries and counting. We'll keep releasing new ones as he tells a different version of his story or changes his mind again. So yeah.

If this bill doesn’t pass millions will die for lack of whatever exactly it is that this bill is going to pay for.Just think of it: It’s $3.5 trillion in spending. Some of it just has to be absolutely critical. Even if $2 trillion were just completely wasted on stupid nonsense that would still leave $1.5 trillion spent on extremely crucial stuff—stuff someone somewhere probably needs. That’s why I’m violently angry at whoever is standing in the way of whatever this bill is all about.Much of my ire is directed at Senators Manchin and Sinema who are basically murderers denying the people this bill which was going to do something for the very thing this bill was going to pay for—a thing I can only assume those people really needed and without which they will probably die. And if Manchin and Sinema get their way those people will die unmourned—because I’m not exactly sure who those dying people are.And yet Manchin and Sinema stand absolutely alone in blocking this bill I can only presume is essential— alone with no one except fifty Republicans. So are Manchin and Sinema worse than Hitler? Well Hitler never once voted with Republicans so I’ll leave that up to you.So what can we do? Well I don’t usually advocate violence—not more than once a week—but I think it’s morally necessary here that we intimidate Manchin and Sinema into passing this bill. That’s how really really important I assume this bill is. I very strongly suppose this is a matter of life and death. That’s why we have to take a firm stand and make Manchin and Sinema support this bill so the history books will say about us “When the time came to do something about the thing they passed that spending bill which paid for the stuff that was needed and helped some groups of people.” Or something like that.

One man is building a house without a building permit while some neighborhood children sell homemade lemonade from their driveway and then a quick cut shows us a woman selling raw milk outside her family dairy that hasn't been approved by the FDA. The next scene shows a fully packed church with hundreds of people who are not socially distanced bowing their heads in prayer to an all-powerful being that isn't the government. Wow. Creepy!The premise of the movie is quite outside what modern American moviegoers living in a cradle-to-grave welfare state expect and it might be too much for some viewers. At publishing time the Motion Pictures Association of America is rating this movie NC-17 for scenes of sheer terror depicting a restrained government just following the Constitution and not telling you what to do with your life.

It’s just been crazy around here!Fall is here and ladies we all know what that means: cooler weather Friday night football and popping Xanax before your annual family photoshoot.You know how it goes: you spend countless hours sacrificing quality family time and even missing your second child’s birthday party to piece together the most enviable fall wardrobe for your family photos. You know for once in my life I would just like to hear my 5-year-old say “Thanks Mom!  Thanks for these $200 riding boots and tiny tailored blazer that make me look like a mini equestrian from a much richer family!” But no. These kids are ungrateful and honestly not even that cute without my keen eye for styling fresh haircuts and heavily edited photography.What’s more is that my kids are too dense to realize that I’m doing all this for them!  It’s like they don’t even realize that being a whiny shrill virus-multiplying creature is really not a good look on anyone. Which is why on this one day I must capture them in the perfect combination of warm tones solids plaids infinity scarves and Sherpa accents. All those school suspensions will be white noise behind the canvas on our wall that everyone will judge us by.Sure under all that flannel there is a little tension by the time we arrive for the photoshoot. Perhaps threatening to smash my tween’s Nintendo with a hammer and slipping our toddler Benadryl was a bit extreme but it’s only because I want people to be able to see the real them! I want people to see my children as I see them – or at least how I see them when I’m drunk on a couple’s getaway and feeling strangely nostalgic. Then after months of preparation and several thousand dollars in thirty minutes it’s all over. All those phone calls from the fire department about my kid shooting rockets off the nursing home roof are in the rearview. A new reality has arrived framed forever in gorgeous mahogany.Honest truth if you can’t see past my children’s pathological behavior to their freshly pressed Boden and Dior attire then I’m not sure I can help you. I admit these kids of mine have left me questioning so many life decisions and maybe even prevented a small handful of our friends from becoming parents but I think the number of views on my Insta is clearly redeeming. So do this mom a solid and take a look at these remarkable family photos that we will be paying off for the next 12 months. I need this in my life. Look at them. LOOK AT THEM!

"We cannot allow any sort of healthy dissension especially from highly trained healthcare providers to help guide us."The administration has promised to make it easy to recognize unvaccinated medical professionals by ensuring they are unemployed. If one of these out-of-work doctors attempts to talk about the vaccine the CDC has recommended citizens place their fingers in their ears and begin singing 'Baby Shark'."It's hard to even put into words how stupid the CDC is" said a local doctor who also writes for a satire site and must remain anonymous. "I have natural immunity because I kept taking care of patients when this pandemic hit. My entire family became really ill but those were the risks we had to take. Now hear me: the vaccine is a medical marvel. It has saved many lives it has allowed my elderly patients to resume living—I am very grateful for it. Yet while the vaccine is very safe it is not a zero-risk intervention. Real significant adverse events can occur although rarely. So for someone with natural immunity—which the latest data shows to be seven times stronger than vaccination—there is simply no reason they should be compelled into vaccination and take on that risk of an adverse event.

His staffers erupted in laughter after he displayed the slip of paper upon which he had penned the hilarious three-word sketch: “Orange man bad.”“I’ve still got it” Colbert laughed.At press time the writers of The Babylon Bee announced that they were inspired by Colbert's return to comedy and will stop reporting real news to try out comedy as well.

This year make sure to carefully check your kids’ candy before they eat it being especially on the lookout for vaccination needles.The COVID-19 vaccine has not been approved for children but some deranged individuals may try to vaccinate kids anyway by hiding needles inside the candy. If your children receive candy from anyone wearing a mask—like the paper ones not werewolf masks—or if they have a "Hate Has No Home Here" sign in their yard you need to be very cautious of the candy they receive.Signs of a vaccine would be a needle sticking out of a candy bar. Also there could be a label on it such as “Pfizer Edible.” You may also find some Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups in your children’s candy; these aren’t a threat but take a few for yourself because checking candy is hard work.Authorities say to be particularly suspicious if your kids trick-or-treat in Dr. Fauci’s neighborhood. He’s attracting kids to his house by giving out full-sized candy bars but you want to check those carefully.

"While my sister my mom my aunt my sister-in-law my cousin and great aunt Betty have all been sexually harrassed by one of the Cuomos I have not. I stand here today with both buttocks un-squeezed."The news left journalists and the Cuomo brothers in shock. "No way this story checks out" said CNN's head of human resources Stan Bingham. "Look I've known Chris for years I know his character and the kind of man he is and there is no way he didn't assault that woman. We simply cannot always believe women just because they are the ones making the claim these sorts of outrageous assertions deserve a serious and thorough investigation."Andrew Cuomo took the opportunity to crawl out of whatever cardboard box he's living in to also make a statement. "I for one am deeply offended that Ms. Huntley didn't simply pick up the phone and call me so we could settle this thing like adults. Instead she runs to the media who of course has made the snap judgment of taking her word over mine. I hope everyone out there watching realizes this sort of thing can happen to you too if we don't have due process for all."While investigators have thus far corroborated Ms. Huntley's story they did discover that Andrew Cuomo was responsible for her grandmother's death in a New York nursing home who may or may not have been harassed by Chris before her passing.

Normal means an end to all that. Well hopefully normal is dead for good.”

I guess that’s the same as saying ‘Amen’ to a prayer in Spanish.”Sullivan realized he may have made another mistake by saying “Amen.” “Was I supposed to say that?” he asked. “I mean what’s Spanish for ‘Amen’?”

If our children don’t spend every waking hour fearful that they’ll get killed by a virus they might accidentally let their masks slip down from their noses for a few seconds. And then we’re all dead.So here are some tips to make sure your kids are sufficiently scared of COVID.1) Buy a loud alarm and do COVID drills: “We saw someone on the street without a mask! Everyone hide under your beds!”2) Tell them the COVID monster is hiding in their closet waiting to eat them up if they take off their mask: If there's one thing kids are terrified of it's monsters. This is because they are dumb. Use that dumbness to your advantage and manipulate their trust and fear to slow the spread!3) Constantly talk about "long COVID": If your child ever encounters another child who has recovered from COVID that might convince them not to be scared. So tell them all those people now have "long COVID" and are secretly disfigured and maimed for life.4) Tell them Elmo died from COVID: Kids love Elmo. And he’d still be around if everyone had gotten the vaccine and worn their masks properly.5) Get them a pretend vaccine card: They can practice showing it to everyone before interacting with people to know how important that is. But make sure they know they’re still a deadly danger to everyone around them since they’re not really vaccinated.6) Tell them they’re not going back to school because all their teachers and classmates died from COVID: It’s only a white lie. They’re most likely never going to see a regular classroom again anyway.7) In addition to wearing a mask outside also have your kids wear blindfolds: Tell them it’s to protect them from seeing all the horrors of the COVID-ravaged land.8) Hire a psychopath to dismember one of your pets and tell them COVID did that: It will be a striking reminder about the dangers of COVID. Plus local psychopaths are always looking for work.9) Tell them Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is hiding in their closet: All that man wants to do is kill people with COVID!10) Cut all power and water to your house and claim society has completely collapsed from nearly everyone dying of COVID: You’re just preparing them for next year.Follow these tips and your kids should spend most of their days curled up in a ball and shaking in fear of the virus coming to get them — and scientists say being curled up on the floor really reduces the chance of spread. Now that’s some good parenting!NOT SATIRE: Help us save our kids from fear lockdowns and leftwing indoctrination!

"It's basically free money! And President Xi promised me an introductory 0.0% APR for the first month! And I get points for gas and groceries with every purchase! How can you not take that deal?"He then waved the card around for the cameras causing the assembled press to "ooh" and "aah" at the shininess and redness of it.Experts say the spending bill will solve all the problems our country faces and will continue to do so until it's time to pass another one next month. The card will charge 0% interest for the first month after which the rate increases to the firstborn child of every American citizen.Biden has promised that after we've used up our Chinese credit card he will fund further spending bills with a daring diamond heist and he will then bet all the diamonds on black in a vegas casino craps table to make up the remaining funds.Unfortunately Biden's plan to use his new VISA card was ruined when AOC got ahold of it and bought $1 trillion worth of "Tax The Rich" dresses.

"I heard the data tape from Master Rogan about what these vaccines are doing to our midichlorian counts. Midichlorians continually speak to us telling us the will of the force so they're very important to my Jedi powers. I just can't take that risk."According to archive historians the Force used to be a cool mystical mysterious force but then scientists discovered it was all connected to midichlorians inside the cells and now the Force is completely lame. Still Jedi rely on its powers to defeat their Sith enemies.Spokesman for the CHA Greeka the Hutt dismissed the rumors as a "deranged conspiracy theory" and has issued a mandate requiring all Jedi to be vaccinated or be expelled from the Jedi Order. He also asked Jedi to stop taking off-label Bantha dewormer.

"How would the sun get through? How I ask you?! How would the sun be able to pierce through this oppressive dome of iron?""How would the plants grow? Dictionary.com clearly states that plants need sun to live" she said reading off her iPhone. Ocasio-Cortez also passionately argued that technically the "Iron Dome" is "not ironic" because "ironic has nothing to do with iron I have recently learned."She also pointed out that in order to mine all the iron ore we would need for a country-sized iron dome we would have to go into many dungeons and spend a long time swinging our pickaxes. "Is it worth endangering the lives of the working-class—sending them to certain death against spiders creepers and zombies—just to fund this ridiculous vanity project? I think not."At publishing time Ocasio-Cortez had reversed her stance after learning the dome would only be blocking the sun for the Jews.

"I couldn't believe it—I gave years and years of my life to the Border Patrol defending this country and this is what I get. Oh well. Maybe McDonald's is hiring."Analysts say these are the worst horse unemployment numbers in modern American history."Traditionally it has been very easy for horses to find work in our country" said Dr. Edward Little. "From portraying talking horses on television and acting in big Hollywood pictures like Braveheart and Lord of the Rings to pulling carriages and racing there's usually plenty of opportunity for horses here in America. But Biden ruined all that."Jen Psaki claimed the numbers aren't actually that bad and that if you don't count "not being able to find a job" as unemployment the unemployment rate of horses decreases to "almost nothing."Trump called the numbers "pathetic" and "sad" and promised that when he gets into office in 2024 he will employ "more horses than anyone ever in all of human history the best employment numbers maybe ever!"

According to a Gallup poll 96% of Americans now approve of COVID up from just 2% before The View broadcast was interrupted with two of the hosts testing positive for the virus. "You know this COVID thing isn't so bad" said one man in the waiting room at his doctor's office as he watched the show get stopped in its tracks by the virus. He coughed into his hand. "I actually think I have it right now—but to be honest it's worth it if it even briefly stops them thar ladies from yappin'." COVID has said that it's satisfied with its work though it was disappointed in itself for not getting the other two hosts as well and not stopping the show for longer. "I'm no hero—I'm just doing what any respiratory disease in my shoes would do" COVID said in an interview Friday. "I know any one of you other diseases would do the same for me."

Now they are being issued fresh equipment: Segways and pool noodles which will be used to keep unruly immigrants in line as they flood across the Rio Grande. "This represents a massive step forward for the treatment of people ignoring our laws entirely" said Psaki at a press conference Friday. When a reporter asked about how this would affect the border crisis Psaki responded "Would you like a chocolate chip cookie or a warm raisin cookie?" And everyone clapped. The new order handed down today will force the Border Patrol to wave their pool noodles and playfully slap immigrants as they come into the country while the Segways will allow them to chase the refugees so long as they stay on paved roads or travel through any kind of indoor mall. "This is a victory for all countries around the world" said Psaki. "Well except one."

Therefore the experts are claiming the lockdowns were very effective at stopping the spread of COVID."Yeah we Americans are like huge now" said Dr. Hank Binkowski a researcher at MIT as he scarfed down an entire bag of Cheetos Sweetos Cinnamon Sugar Puffs. "So like we can't even get out the door -- not even if we grease it with butter. Which is good for society: everyone in their homes no one interacting everyone just getting all fat and depressed and stuff. Basically everybody is huge now and that's a good thing."(The one exception to this increase in obesity according to the CDC is your mom who was already massive.)Sadly because of the lockdowns Americans are now much more vulnerable to COVID as they are huge so experts are calling for another round of lockdowns to protect the Americans made fat by the first round of lockdowns.

"Such an incredible statement! Powerful. Moving. And not the least bit ironic." She then checked her dictionary. "Yep I'm right. Not ironic at all technically speaking."Many wondered how Ocasio-Cortez would vote as the dress seemed to indicate some kind of desire to stop the Jews from defending themselves against rocket attacks. "It could go either way here as it's not clear what she's saying there" said one CNN anchor. "It's anybody's ball game at this point."Eventually the representative voted "present" botching her chance to really stick it to the Jews and disappointing her friends in the squad who have uninvited her from sitting at their table at lunch.At publishing time Ocasio-Cortez had begun weeping as the dress changed back into her ordinary $3500 designer pantsuit once the clock struck midnight.

That’s just something we can’t abide in modern society.”So the X-Men have come up with a simple solution to the problem: They’ve kicked all the women out of the group.“Now that there are only men in the group our name is not problematic mon ami” explained X-Man Gambit.X-Men founder Professor X was happy with the change. “I never wanted women in the X-Men in the first place” he said. “I mean I had to spend all this money adding women’s restrooms to the X-Mansion. And none of their powers were that great anyway. I mean Storm can change the weather; that’s useful for salvaging a day at the beach but not for fighting space aliens.”X-Man Colossus agreed. “The only powerful X-Men woman is Jean Grey but you know how women are: always getting possessed by a cosmic entity and trying to kill everyone.”Others think things will go more smoothly without women. “I’m just tired of constantly hearing all the women in our group say ‘I’m cold’” said X-Man Iceman.Now that the problem of their name has been solved the X-Men are also addressing whether the way Wolverine refers to everyone as “bub” is inappropriately gendered but the last time someone brought it up people got stabbed.Sadly the move to ban all women inadvertently banned Cyclops as well (since he is actually a little girly sissy crybaby and everyone's least favorite X-Man).

Or do I get to open it now? What's inside?" she asked Representative Ilhan Omar."We're not talking to you" Omar said folding her arms. "You're not invited to the sleepover tonight anymore.

All for naught!" she cried. "I like totally would have voted against the Dome if I had realized I wouldn't get a present."After taking a deep breath and calming down Ocasio-Cortez tried to exit the Capitol but ran into the closed screen door (because she is so stupid).

Her first adventure was going well with Jane Bond sneaking through the villain Silverfoot’s lair but when she found where Silverfoot kept his evil plans disaster struck: The plans were sealed inside a pickle jar.Jane Bond struggled to open the jar to retrieve the plans for ten minutes finally giving up so she could instead find the temperature controls for the hollowed-out volcano as she was feeling cold. She shrieked when she saw a spider though and was quickly captured.“So Silverfoot do you expect me to talk?” asked Jane Bond while she was strapped to a table with a laser inching toward her to cut her in two.“No you’re always talking” Silverfoot replied. “I just want you to shut up for once.”“Too bad! We’re talking!”Jane Bond’s gambit of trying to talk about her relationship with the supervillain worked causing Silverfoot to flee the room and giving her an opportunity to escape. She caused millions of pounds in property damage though in the ensuing car chase most of it at the very end when she tried to parallel park her Aston Martin.It was a rough first outing and she was happy to end it with an appletini (shaken not stirred).

He had been a fan of true crime podcasts for years but never dreamed he would get to be on one. Now totally unexpectedly it was happening. With each thud of the ax into his torso his life was draining from his body and his wish list was filling up.This was it. He would be on a podcast.Yes though he did eventually kick the bucket Marcus's family said he also kicked one thing off his bucket list. "He loved them all; Serial Monster My Favorite Murder... it was an industry he really wanted to get into but he couldn't seem to get his foot in the door" said Marcus's mother Abileen Marcus. She told reporters that Marcus had tried to start his own true-crime podcast but had fallen short in one important area: murdering.Experts in the field say that without murder a true-crime podcast will really have a hard time getting off the ground. "One life per episode minimum" said True Crime podcast host Yearling Smith. "They must pay not only with their blood but their very soul."Family members take solace in the fact that Marcus died doing something he loved and as true crime junkies they are all excited to listen to the inevitable podcast episode he makes it onto. "We're OK with him being on Investigation Discovery or something dry like that but what we really hope for is for him to be on one of those sillier true crime podcasts like My Favorite Murder. If there is one thing a family really wants to hear after their loved one is chopped up with an ax it's a couple of improv comedians using their death as a springboard for on-the-fly quips amidst middle-aged women cackling to the point of tears" Marcus's brother Dillon Marcus told the press.

We at the Babylon Bee are geniuses when it comes to thinking of new animal designs. Here are ten ideas:1) Boneless chickens: Why do delicious chickens have so many bones in them anyway? They make it so much harder to eat! We need new chickens without bones.2) Talking lions voiced by Liam Neeson: We're not sure why God didn't make all lions voiced by Liam Neeson to begin with.3) Birds like real ones: Everyone knows that birds are all just robotic drones that spy for the CIA. But they're kinda a cool idea. We should have real ones.4) Cotton candy web-spinning spiders: That way walking into a spider web becomes kinds of a pleasant surprise!5) Naked mole-rats with the heads of cobras: Not sure about this one but it was a special request from Bill Gates. Please God make one before Bill Gates does.6) Dolphins who are a little more sensitive to social justice issues: Seriously. We're sick of dolphins squeaking and frolicking happily in the waves while doing nothing about inequity. So selfish.7) Pigs only all the meat is bacon: We've never been quite sure what the rest of the pig is even for but it should all be just bacon.8) A Mitt Romney with the head of a rhino: We already got a rhino with the head of Mitt Romney and it was kind of a dud.9) Dogs that pick up their own poop: Would also be cool if they could play poker.10) Parrots that only recite scripture: What's with these obscenity-spouting parrots?

That makes it tough because we don't have their phone number and stuff. We have to track all that down.

"It's hard to believe such a thing could happen in our country."Former President Obama also weighed in saying: "This is...uh...not who we are."The Border Patrol has apologized saying the offending agents will be placed on unpaid leave immediately pending investigation.

'September 22nd 2021',https://babylonbee.com/news/bathtime-review-a-torrid-pointless-affair,"Bathtime Review: A Torrid, Pointless Affair",I try to keep an open mind. I’m always trying new experiences. I’ll play with anything I can find in whatever cabinets I can open. I’ll stick just about any object in my mouth. But despite my parents’ insistence that I should enjoy it I find bathtime a rather miserable affair.What’s the least fun liquid to drink? That’s right: water the tasteless entity that has no reason to exist when there are such things as fruit juice. And instead of drinking this water I am placed into it. It’s bizarre.And my parents act like this is fun time but if I actually try to have fun by doing things such as splashing the water at them I get discouraged. Because this is not fun time. That’s a lie. They’re not giving me a bath for me. They’re giving me a bath for them.“Oh you’re dirty” they say—like this is something I care about. I like being caked in dirt and dried ketchup. That’s when I’m at my most comfortable. But my parents are slaves to soulless aesthetics. It’s how I look on the surface that’s important to them so into the bath I go. And then there’s the greatest indignity—water dumped over my head. And afterward my parents seem so pleased with their work when they could have just let me be in my filth and happiness.I rate bathtime one star though I wish I knew of some concept lower than one to rate it.

Specifically the Oath for new doctors is being adjusted to exclude both the unborn and the unvaccinated. “The changes we’re making to the Oath are long overdue” said Dr. Sarah Butcher a member of the AAMC ruling council. “The concept that physicians should attempt to do no harm to the unborn or the unvaccinated has no place in modern society.”Butcher said the famous first line of the Oath will be updated to read “I promise to do no harm unless it's killing a little unborn baby who's really not a person yet. Also since anyone who refused the vaccine is basically asking to die of COVID I will let them suffer and die a horrifying death to set an example for others.” Several other changes are also being made to the Oath including the following new sections:In addition to the changes in the Oath the AAMC also announced updates to the educational requirements required for new doctors. “The requirements for licensure have changed slightly” Butcher said. “We now require licensed doctors to either have a traditional four-year medical school degree or at least 1000 hours of experience surfing WebMd.”

And without being able to name her terrible policies her critics end up just looking like woman-hating racists."She was a genius pick for VP" said political consultant David Axelrod. "When Joe Biden chose her as his running mate her unlikability was so all-consuming that mounting a logical offense was near impossible. Like someone asking you to name 3 songs from your favorite band when asked to name what Kamala has done wrong most people's nervous systems become so overwhelmed with rage well they just can’t do it."As the border crisis escalates sources close to VP Harris report that she plans to rise to the occasion by being more unlikeable than ever.

A journalist from CNN asked if the sound was coming from a real horse.Border agent Bob Arthur expressed disappointment in the decision but said he understands why it had to happen. “We Texans can get carried away once we hop on a horse. From up there anything moving looks like a steer needing to be lassoed hogtied then branded. It’s good they revoked our horse privileges before we pulled out our standard-issue branding irons.”Officer Gallahad of Border Patrol Central Command says the change has already produced positive results such as increased capture of illegal immigrants. He credits the increase to the fact that immigrants facing this new coconut-laden threat are unable to flee while also laughing uncontrollably.Fortunately for Border Patrol most migrants are deciding to return to their home countries after hearing horror stories of vaccine ID restrictions unfairly targeting minority families in cities like New York City.

But some older Democrats don’t like the wasteful direction the party is currently going citing such bills as the $3.5 trillion infrastructure deal. One such Democrat is outspoken former Senator Felton Carmichael who remembers when they used to try to destroy the country in a much more fiscally responsible way.“Back in my day we had more elegant and subtle plans to undermine America and freedom” said Carmichael “such as secret meetings with the Soviets and more targeted bills that chipped away at individual rights. But all the young upstarts these days have nothing but trillions and trillions in spending plans. I mean have you seen the Green New Deal? If that’s what it costs to destroy the United States we’ll never be able to afford it.”Younger Democrats such as members of “the Squad” disagree. “Spending lots of money is fun” explained Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez the world’s smartest socialist. “You can buy things with it like pretty dresses. Maybe we can buy everyone pretty dresses—or at least me and then I can attend a gala where everyone can see it. That’s the same as everyone getting the dress. But old dummies like Felton Carmichael don’t understand this. I wish they would die from their oldness so we can spend more trillions.”Carmichael though doesn’t seem to have much respect for Democrats like Ocasio-Cortez. “We have these whippersnappers who spout off about Marxism” said Carmichael “but who never had the time or patience to actually read books by the founder of Marxism Bob Marxism. They have no idea what they’re doing and they’re going to bankrupt the U.S. before we can annihilate it. I wanted to not leave this country to my grandkids but I don’t think that’s going to happen now.”

According to other members of the hardcore tabletop game group Fauci changed the rules in the middle over and over again and kept claiming he was just "following the rulebook."This first came up when Fauci and his pals were playing a game of Pandemic. Other players were doing a decent job keeping the disease cubes in check and working toward a cure when Fauci's turn rolled around. He immediately started throwing his cards up in the air picked up a bunch of yellow cubes from Lagos and began chewing on them."What are you doing?!" asked Clyde a regular at Fauci's local game shop."Yeah uh... chewing on the cubes eradicates them. It's science. Right in the rulebook.""I mean... technically I guess it does eradicate them" Clyde said shrugging.Fauci then pulled out a Space Marine figure from his Warhammer collection and began blasting all the cubes away. "PEW PEW PEW! BLEH I'M DEAD!" he cried as he had the Marine use his Bolter to blast everything on the board. "There. We won! Great job guys. I should get an award. What game is next?"The doctor then made up a rule that all astronauts had to be distanced by at least six tiles in Galaxy Trucker and that the Rebels had to surrender to the Empire by galactic law in Star Wars: Rebellion. The last straw was when he tried to forcibly shut down all the small hotel chains in Acquire and only let the giant monopolies win."Those guys suck" Fauci said through tears after flipping the board taking his stack of games and leaving. "I didn't want to play with them anyway."

What Biden has particularly failed at is stopping the spread of COVID-19. Still people have noticed that there is one place that COVID hasn’t spread to: outer space. But Biden isn’t getting any credit for that because most people credit that to former President Trump’s famous Space Force.“I specifically designed Space Force to be the best force ever made” Trump explained to the press. “Way better than Delta Force or even the Force from Star Wars. That’s why nothing gets by them and thus since I’ve made Space Force in space there have been no terrorists no drug lords no graffiti artists and no coronavirus.”The Biden administration has fought back against the idea that the excellent record on COVID in space is due to Space Force instead saying that the lack of COVID in space is because of Biden’s strict masking and vaccine policies. Trump has dismissed this idea.“Vaccines don’t work in space because of space radiation” Trump explained. “This is basic space science. No the only reason space is so safe is because of my Space Force patrolling space with its space lasers. That’s because I did everything perfectly as president... except for letting the election get stolen from me. That was my one and only mistake.”Trump said that if he were still president he would have designed a type of Space Force that operated on Earth to eliminate COVID here but since he’s not president that won’t happen and “most likely everyone is going to die.”

The solution is obvious: we need to build more bridges for them to live under.”Fortunately for House Democrats as well as for the suffering migrants the $1 trillion infrastructure bill currently before Congress includes spending for bridges. “All we need to do” Speaker Pelosi added “is put in a little more money for a few additional bridges and then the one in Del Rio won’t be so overcrowded. We plan to add bridges in Pennsylvania Georgia and Arizona where these voters I mean hard working migrants can go live.”A Democratic staffer speaking off the record explained: “Of course you need to understand that when we say ‘bridges’ we may not mean ‘bridges’ in the traditional sense. Just as the word ‘infrastructure’ now means things like child care and health care the word ‘bridge’ will now mean things like low-income housing developments.

Says "Greetings fellow Trump supporters would you like to insurrect something on this fine morning?": Something feels off here.3. Keeps calling you "Mr. Anderson" for some reason: And they keep calling you the chosen one and trying to kill you. Weird!4. Their MAGA hat is clearly just an FBI hat with duct tape over it: FBI agents are not known for their creative disguises.5. Look for their forked lizard tongue and reptilian eyes: They will usually flick their tongues and hiss if you show them a LEGO set.6. Screeches in terror at the name of Donald Trump: Plus touching the Art of the Deal will burn their hands.7. Their Apple AirPods have a curly wire hanging down and look suspiciously like an FBI earpiece - They may claim they're just jamming along to Carly Rae Jepsen but they're really waiting for the go-ahead to take you down.There you have it! Be careful out there!

We consulted over two theologians we found on YouTube one of whom calls himself the Third Eagle of the Apocalypse and we asked them to lay out for us all the similarities between our glorious savior Trump and Jesus Christ.Here are the ten craziest coincidences:1. Both used to be in construction before beginning their public careers. - Uncanny!2. Both of them will be returning any day now. - Admittedly one of these is more likely to happen than the other.3. Jesus made America Trump made America great again. - Jesus created the world and founded America and Trump brought it back from the brink of destruction.4. They were both Republicans. - Obviously.5. Jesus died and came back three days later—Trump went to Walter Reed with a cold and came back in glory. - The exact same thing! Uncanny!6. A lot of Trump's supporters denied him afterward. - Sad! Not good!7. Both of them are well-known for their great humility. - Trump has the best humility everyone says so.8. Trump feeds the hungry with the excellent taco bowls at the Trump Tower Grill. - It's just like creating food out of nothing.9. Both were crucified though admittedly Trump's was just by the media. - It still hurt ok?10. Both of them are the mortal enemy of Democrats. - Democrats hate Trump. You know who else they hate? God. That's right.Any more eerie similarities? Let us know in the comments. Unless you're poor. Then send us your thoughts via the USPS.

Some of the excrement was produced fresh for the message while most had been lying on the sidewalk unused for months.Local sources say many people so far seem to be avoiding the area where the words were written. A few onlookers were critical of the message calling it “disgusting” “crappy” and “corny.” But they were probably racist Larry Elder supporters.The homeless population however was unequivocal in their support for the Governor. When asked what they love most about Newsom every homeless person had the same answer. “Change” they replied. Then they kept repeating it. “Change please. Change?” It seems the homeless are big fans of all the change that has taken place under Newsom’s leadership.Businesses fleeing the state a rise in violent crime and thousands of prisoners granted early release have all provided the homeless with a growing community of friends joining them under the bridges where they live. With a track record like that who wouldn’t be begging for more change?Scattered around the smeared poop the streets of San Francisco were also littered with used hypodermic needles presumably a result of California’s high vaccination rate thanks to Gavin Newsom.

"Thanks to Gavin Newsom literally every middle-class family has moved out of the state! It's been impossible to keep up with demand! Also most of our workers left the state too which kind of stinks."In their second-quarter earnings statement U-Haul revealed their sales on the West Coast have increased over 37000% as every human with a pulse and marginal desire for a better life has packed up all their worldly belongings and chosen to leave for greener pastures in a giant U-Haul truck."We are deeply grateful to Gavin for our success in 2021" said Buggstein. "The only problem now is that we're all out of trucks. And no one is willing to drive a U-Haul back to California. And I'm leaving with my family as well. So I guess this is it! Bye everyone!" Buggstein then jumped in the last U-Haul with his family and took off for Texas.Congrats to Gavin Newsom!

The Americans are coming!!""Hey look those Chinese generals are my buddies they deserve fair warning—I've known them for ten years now and they are always so nice to me. They were super supportive about that whole Afghanistan withdrawal thing—those friendships are more important than some job" explained General Milley America's highest-ranking military officer."I mean—they aren't close friends we don't get together for poker or anything. But we do sometimes exchange funny memes and nuclear codes. We also play that game 'Battleship' but I use the actual coordinates of the 7th fleet which adds that element of realism which makes it more fun."Several members of the media military and those with objective neurons in their brains saw the midnight ride differently accusing the General of treason. While admitting that factually he totally committed treason General Milley defended his actions as morally correct. "You all think this is so clear-cut like there is some clear chain of command we are supposed to follow in the military. It's not that simple" said General Milley. "What if you had a commander who ordered an airstrike against terrorists who kept people in concentration camps but that felt kind of rash to you? And what if those terrorists had just sent you a hilarious cat .gif? Put yourself in my shoes.""It sure is easy to cast stones from the peanut gallery out there. But someday a President is going to come along that is angry rash incompetent and borderline demented and that President is going to make an enormous mess out of a military operation leading to the deaths of many Americans" he said angrily. "Hopefully that day never comes."

Woo hoo!"The crowd of mail-in ballots clapped and cheered excited to be locking down again."Please be advised" Newsom continued "that police will be enforcing the lockdown quite strictly in the Yountville area near The French Laundry restaurant.

Except for the essential workers like cooks and waiters or whatever and whoever makes that incredible wagyu with hen egg custard that I love so much."According to sources California's middle-class mail-in ballots are really excited for their mail-in ballot kids to keep wearing masks at school and for their mail-in ballot wives to be barred from spending money at hair salons which will now be closed forever.

But the government isn’t doing that for my sweet Abuela! Instead she lives in poverty with all these holes in her roof which is sad and gross.”Sources say that AOC had planned to continue doing nothing for her family and leaving it to the government but a social media director felt the image of her ‘Tax The Rich’ dress covering some holes in a roof would be ‘dope’.“I am super sad to lose this dress but we’re going to use the same lettering to make my ‘Tax The Rich’ private jet we will fly to Puerto Rico” said AOC. “Which by the way the fact that everyone does not have their own Gulfstream is horrible. People are out there breaking into businesses just to get bread instead of flying cool jets – all because we won’t tax the rich!”At publishing time AOC had considered canceling the trip over security concerns – however she changed her mind after she found out she could pay her security guards to wear ‘Defund The Police' t-shirts.

"We couldn't agree more with her statement that the rich should be taxed which they clearly aren't. Of course AOC should be the exception due to her being a socialist hero."Speaking to reporters after landing in D.C. AOC said: "I like just thought of doing that while sitting all bored and stuff in my jet. Then I commanded my indentured slave pilot to write in the sky about how important it is to tax the rich! Yay socialism!" AOC then tripped and fell on the tarmac because she had forgotten how to tie her shoes.The message also inspired lawmakers in Congress who are putting forward legislation to tax the rich for the first time ever.

"And he - or she? - definitely said no vaccines for Steve. It's a really important part of my new religion all over the pages of that leather-bound thing God's Book Of Rules or whatever. Can I get my exemption now?"The survey showed that while mainline denominations continue to see a membership decline the number of people who believe in weird-sounding religions that might not believe in vaccines has grown exponentially. Pew reported that 5% of respondents selected 'Pew' as their religion mistaking the name at the top for a new religion."Well honestly I'm a Methodist but we're good with vaccines. So when OSHA rolls around I'm going with pescetarianism - that's the right one isn't it?" asked local x-ray technician Rob Gough. "Yes sir that's me. Guess I should look up the nearest pescetarian church in case they ask."Healthcare workers in particular who already survived COVID have called for natural immunity exceptions to the mandate but President Biden said that his wife is a doctor and she got the injection no big deal.

Here at the Babylon Bee we pride ourselves in exposing misinformation and then murdering it in broad daylight to warn other misinformations that may try to sneak up and misinform people and undermine the very foundations of our incorruptible government.Here are ten reasons you can rest assured that the recall election will be safe and secure:1) Mail-in ballots are the most secure system of voting ever devised: That should be obvious after they worked flawlessly to elect Joe Biden.2) A rich white man is running the election: Everyone knows you can trust rich white men.3) Governor Newsom printed extra ballots just in case you lose yours: They are available for free in thousands of ballot vending machines around the state! Cool!4) Newsom has volunteered to personally count all the ballots himself for maximum security: What a nice guy!5) Because CNN said so: And CNN has been named the most accurate source of news in the state of California for 20 years running!6) The progressive and open-minded people of California would NEVER conspire to prevent a black man from becoming governor: That's just silly.7) Gavin Newsom is an expert at keeping things safe and secure: Like the southern border.8) People like Harvey Weinstein are able to trust Gavin Newsom with their deepest darkest secrets: So you can surely trust him with your election.9) With all the fraud in the last few elections we're confident they've gotten all the kinks out: We're pretty sure this one's gonna run smoothly this time.10) Any suggestion that Democrat politicians would operate with anything less than total integrity is a deranged conspiracy theory: And you should be ashamed of yourself for even thinking it. I hope you're happy with yourself. We've alerted the FBI.There you have it! Can't argue with this reasoning!NOT SATIRE: Swing State Steal is a Party Game of Theft to commemorate the 2020 election.

And Cheats. Cheats galore! Cheats by the pallet-full. Mail-in cheats. Polling place cheats. Vote counting frauds! It's all here. Except in this game the Incumbent gets a shot at getting them back.

"Did anyone catch any of that? Poor Kenneth! He doesn't seem to know English. Can someone please go tell him to just talk to me?"According to those watching the broadcast Copeland started off with a lot of ha-la-ba-la sounds which had a nice Arabic flare to it. Then came the hard consonants with what sounded like a hakuna-matata thrown in. Sadly no one was there to interpret anything being said leaving only the vague impression of a resounding gong. Then came the standard promise of blessings in return for cash.The next day as Copeland was walking in for his broadcast he stopped for a moment to look up. Seeing the vastness of sky it suddenly struck him how very small he was; but then it struck him that to God the whole world was very small. And this creator this God came near to His small little world because He loved the little things in it. The vastness of eternity became something slight—a man—to tear apart everything that separated the finite from the everlasting.Standing outside the studio he found himself momentarily disabused of everything separating him and God—his search for validation his deep-seated nihilism—but then quickly remembered his Gulfstream jet payment was coming due and came to his senses.According to sources the Almighty is still waiting patiently for Copland to talk to him in plain English and confess his sins.

The government needs to take measures to protect me and my precious vaccinated blood from the virus.”There have been pushes to put masks on “dirty grubby unvaccinated children” to help protect all the essential vaccinated adults but some worry masks simply won’t be enough.“The government needs to round up all those deranged unvaccinated lunatics and take them far away from us” said Benjamin Reed who had the Moderna vaccine. “They have the COVID and could give it to us. I spend all my waking hours worrying about us elite vaccinated people being tainted by the COVID.”It’s generally agreed that the unruly unvaccinated must be isolated from vaccinated society to protect the vaccinated and the science-blessed vaccine from the virus.“I’m scared of COVID” said Garth Strudelfudd a political commentator. “And that’s why I took the vaccine: as a symbol of my continued terror of COVID and to loudly declare I will never stop being scared of it. It was important to protect ourselves from COVID before the vaccine but now that we have it and have become higher beings—the vaccinated—it’s even more important that we be protected.”

'September 13th 2021',https://babylonbee.com/news/new-study-proves-refs-are-totally-biased-against-your-team,"New Study Proves Referees Are Totally Biased Against Your Team",CAMBRIDGE MA—Sports researchers at Harvard have proven that the officials are totally biased against your favorite teams. Their report entitled the Referee Equity and Fairness (REF) study will be published next month in Sports Illustrated. Dr. James Fairplay the lead researcher on the study for more than two decades said the results were hardly surprising. “We always suspected the refs were against you but now we have empirical evidence to back up our hypothesis” he noted. “The REF study proves that the referees umpires judges and other officials at all levels of sport are most definitely always biased against your favorite teams.” The study which was the first of its kind looked at thousands of sporting events since the year 2000. Researchers interviewed hundreds of players coaches and fans of all teams involved and asked them to rate the fairness of the officials on anonymous surveys. “We found strong evidence of referee bias against your teams in every single survey” Fairplay noted. “This was true at every level from pee-wee to the pros and even at the Olympics. Whichever teams you were rooting for the refs were definitely against them. Honestly we’re not sure why nobody picked up on this before.” Fairplay also said referee bias is almost certainly the reason why your team didn’t make the playoffs last year and why your fantasy team is doing so poorly. Now that the REF study is concluded Fairplay said researchers will turn their attention to figuring out whether the broadcasters calling the game on TV are actively rooting against your favorite teams as well.

Harris immediately grabbed it and said “Hello did he die?”Klain told her that still wasn’t appropriate.“I just care a lot about Joe and his health” Harris explained. “And he’s seemed particularly old lately.

Then I would like to immediately and unconditionally withdraw from their territories and surrender" Biden said to his aides. "Tell them we'll give them whatever they want. Abandon all federal personnel. We need to get out of there immediately. Leave behind all equipment and facilities. Leave no stone... turned? Whatever the expression is that makes sense here."Biden then addressed the nation in a moving speech."My fellow Americans we find ourselves in a grave situation" he said. Kamala Harris jumped up excited at the word "grave" but aides informed her she misunderstood the context and she sadly sat back down. "Republican redneck Taliban have taken over Kentucky and Texas and all the other red states and we must meet all of their demands and pull out right away.

When asked about the plan's impact on black Americans Biden responded: "Colored people? With jobs? Haha that's funny Jack! What's next? Black people becoming president? If black people have good-paying jobs who am I gonna hire to clean my Delaware mansion? You haven't been talking to Corn Pop have ya?" He then sicced his dog Major on a black mail carrier who was just trying to deliver the mail.Jen Psaki was also questioned by pouncing right-wing Fox News reporter Peter Doocy on the matter."Let me be perfectly clear" said Psaki. "We don't actually care about black people. Whew... wow it feels so good to finally just say that out loud" she said with a look of relief on her face.After receiving some more blowback over the new plan the administration later clarified that black people who refuse vaccination should not be considered actual people with human rights but should be treated more like cis white males."We hope that puts everyone at ease and lays this controversy to rest" said an admin spokesperson.

Langley. "It's so sad to see a young healthy woman like Mrs. Madur not drink all eight glasses of water a day as we've been recommending for some time. She was trying to down that last half a glass and then just left it on her bedside table which kind of looked like the house in Signs with all the water containers left everywhere. But she started watching one of her TV shows and forgot about it."Dr. Langley said that as soon as the clock struck midnight Madur realized her mistake and reached for her glass of water to finish it off but it was too late. She died moments later. Her husband says he is dedicating his life to making sure people drink eight glasses of water a day. "It's what she would have wanted" he said somberly.

All official literature clinics marketing and press releases are to use the term "COVID abortions" or "a health procedure that aborts COVID from the body" instead of the previously accepted term "COVID-19 vaccine."Upon hearing the news Biden said that the federal government will vigorously defend an individual's right to either take the vaccine or not take the vaccine in Texas. "We will defend a person's right to choose to get a COVID abortion or not—it's his or her or xer body so it's his or her or xer choice. The government should not be involved in these kinds of personal healthcare decisions. To get a COVID abortion is a decision between a birthing person—or a non-birthing person—and their doctor. The government should stay out of it entirely. Their body their choice. Nothing the government can do about it. Sorry Jack."Biden then leaned in close and whispered "Listen up folks: the government should stay out of healthcare decisions. I'm leaning in close and whispering to emphasize this and because I think it's endearing and not at all creepy. Also you all smell great today. Except you Todd."

Don’t be silly.Heavy hangs the head that wears the crowne especially if that head has already suffered the ravages of many many hair plug operations.

It's pretty cool right? It also has a laser!" said the general as he excitedly pressed a button activating a deadly laser that could cut through metal and skulls.The new design has been criticized by anti-vax right-wing conspiracy theorists as "absolutely freaking terrifying." The Biden Administration assured the public they will have absolutely nothing to worry about if they'll just shut up and get vaccinated.

But there is one delicacy I’ve discovered that I will almost never toss: ketchup.Is ketchup the perfect food? In my multiple years I’ve certainly never encountered anything better. Tangy. Sweet. A beautiful color. A pleasing mouthfeel. Also a pleasing facefeel when I spread it all over my face. Now often I’ll eat it by itself but it also combines so well with other foods. I’ve dipped so many things in ketchup -- french fries corn chips pretzel sticks blueberries my sippy cup and whatever is in reach of my high chair -- and it enhances the flavor of everything.That’s why I demand ketchup now at every meal. If I am ever seated to eat and there is no ketchup I will make my displeasure known. I am a connoisseur; I only want the best and that means ketchup with everything. So just bring it over and leave the bottle if you know what’s good for you.

Others are thinking of moving to California a utopia filled with abortions voter fraud and fire. “They do have a recall election happening” said Turner. “Lots of opportunity for voter fraud there.”Some Democrats are considering turning to their third favorite activity: stealing money from people. Democrats do this either through taxes or mugging as most Democrats are violent criminals. The only problem is that Texas also just passed constitutional carry meaning absolutely anyone Democrats attempt to mug could be armed.“This state sucks” Hughes added.

I just returned from a vacation down in Louisiana and boy was it a mess down there. I wish someone had told me about the damage from the super-spinny-windy-drippy-floody before they sent me down there.

How ridiculous! Everyone knows that only the government should care for the poor with all their great social programs.Not convinced? Here are 10 reasons it's way better to just let the government care for the poor instead.1) There's literally no other way to care for the poor: Literally no other system or group of people have ever been able to help the poor the way government does. That's just science.2) The government is known for its compassion and mercy in all things: Just listen to politicians whenever they speak. You can tell they really care!3) Just look how happy all the people on welfare are: There's nothing like the smile of a permanently impoverished person collecting their government check! That's true joy and fulfillment.4) The government is very efficient and always accomplishes its missions perfectly: Just look at how they handled the war on terror! The war on poverty! The war on drugs! These guys are pros!5) Americans have enough on their plates already: Americans don't have time to care for the poor! They're too busy working to earn money to give the government to use to take care of the poor!6) Thousands of government bureaucrats need something to do with their time: Do you want all those federal employees sitting around feeling bored? What will that do to their self-esteem?7) Nobody knows the people in your community better than a government official living 2000 miles away: It's true. Don't question it.8) Poor people are completely incapable of rising to any challenge or living a life of meaning: It's better to just give them money and hope they leave everyone alone.9) Welfare is so successful its rolls grow more and more every year: Seriously—if welfare were unsuccessful would more and more people every year be collecting it? Isn't that the measure of success? We think so!10) With the government on the case it leaves more time for you to sit around and watch football: That's what life is really all about.Just relax everyone. Your friends in the government will take care of this.NOT SATIRE: The True Charity Initiative (truecharity.us) exists to champion the crazy idea that effective charity requires real compassion and real results. If you think Christians have a personal responsibility to serve the poor you owe it to yourself to check out the resources we offer for churches ministries and volunteers.We’ll give you an exclusive discount on our web course the 7 Marks of Effective Charity so you can be a part of our movement.

"If there was a God why would he allow my butt to feel such intense pain when I use Devil Hard toilet paper? Checkmate!"Richard Dawkins also weighed in. "This toilet paper is like something an ape or a chimp would use and that's all we are so this is perfect!"Devil Hard® toilet paper will be available on store shelves for free-thinkers this November.

White supremacists like Larry Elder. Like I literally can't even.""Say—I should tweet that." She then pulled out her phone and began tweeting.Leftists have called for more relaxed voting with fewer protections against fraud so that only good people will be elected like in California and New York. Frustrated Democrats have promised to leave Texas to live in states where the voting laws aren't evil and racist. Texas Governor Greg Abbot is currently looking at additional legislation to see if he can make more Democrats leave.

We will not falter. We will not fail" Biden said sternly after learning the McFlurry repair guy was trapped on a plane at the airport in Kabul.

We'll pull out all the stops."With tears in his eyes Biden made a personal impassioned address to the McFlurry repairman. "We're pulling for you. We're praying for you. You are not alone.

It is as nonsensical as it sounds.”The CDC no longer recommends worrying about your physical fitness level eating a well-balanced diet or taking vitamins as these are only important if you trust your immune system.The media quickly began promoting the CDC's new guidelines calling the immune system a "far-right conspiracy theory" and "fringe anti-science treatment."Upon hearing this many Americans packed on 50 pounds and picked up smoking to prove that they trust vaccines alone and are not science deniers who trust their body’s immune system.

Thus when a woman becomes inflicted with one (and they’re vague on how this happens other than that it’s the patriarchy’s fault) they kill the baby as soon as possible before all of a woman's aspirations can be destroyed by this terrible monster.But with simple baby murder off the table feminists have no idea what else to do with their enemies. “How do you handle babies?” screamed feminist Gloria Davis. “Are there books on it?”Some have discovered adoption as an option but many see this simply as “allowing the baby to destroy some other woman’s life.” That just leaves what seems like a complicated series of instructions to care for and feed the baby.“It just seems so wrong and unnatural” said one feminist. “Why would I ever want to care for something that just wants to ruin everything?”As for Texas Governor Greg “Tex” Abbott he seemed unperturbed by the panic of feminists. “No more killing babies!” he yelled before adding  “Yee-haw!” and firing a revolver into the air.

"We're not really sure who that is but they need to be impeached immediately.

One controversial scene stands out as a significant departure from the book: Hero Paul Atreides takes ivermectin to protect himself from worms.“You must walk without rhythm or the sandworms of Arrakis will attack” explains the Fremen Stilgar to Paul.“Actually I’ve heard of another way to avoid the worms” says Paul “from a downloadable galactic broadcast by Roe Jogan.” Paul then produced some ivermectin.“That is not an approved use for that!” Stilgar warns. “This Jogan will get us all killed!”Paul does not heed the warning and takes the ivermectin. It is a dosage meant for a horse though and puts him into a coma. When he survives and awakens with complete immunity from the sandworms the native Fremen take it as a sign he is the chosen one.“I will make Arrakis great again!” Paul announces after leading a raid on a veterinary supply store for more ivermectin.“It’s a little odd but I think it goes with the original theme of the book” said one film critic about the scene though he clarified to say he never really understood the theme of the book and just liked “giant sandworms.”

"It would be very irresponsible for us to call them hostages. The word 'hostage' sounds like something from a bad action movie or something. These are merely people being detained against their will until their captors' demands are met. That's not the same thing as being a hostage at all."Psaki then confirmed that the Taliban's every demand will indeed be met including every request for money and weapons as well as every wish they have ever wished upon a star although that's no guarantee that we will get the "people being detained against their will" back home safely."We actually haven't asked for the hos—er I mean—people being detained against their will—to be released yet" she continued. "We're kinda more just hoping that if we're really nice to the Taliban and shower them with gifts they'll release the hostages just to be nice. We really don't want to appear too forward here. After all if we have to ask it doesn't mean as much."The Taliban responded by demanding Biden's head on a silver platter. Sources say this should be an easy demand to meet since Biden has a ton of extra heads lying around.

Thinking quickly on their feet they’ve decided to form a Reverse Underground Railroad.“Unlike the real Underground Railroad that was used to liberate those without a voice and lead them to safety our goal is the exact opposite” explained Nancy Pelosi.Pelosi continued “How inhumane and barbaric would it be to let these babies be born potentially into poverty for a time? That’s why we must rescue them and help them flee to a more civilized state where they can be murdered.”Together Democrats have set up an elaborate network of secret routes and unsafe houses where women can flee oppressive safety and comfort to terminate their children.At publishing time companies such as Uber Lyft and most airlines had already joined the Reverse Underground Railroad promising free travel to any woman wanting to escape and kill their child for convenience.

So I feel like my message is in a good place. Because Jesus said that when you preach his word the world will totally respect you. I think that’s right.

Geese - We're starting with the obvious ones.2. Tarantula hawks - These guys will paralyze a tarantula drag it back to their evil lair lay an egg on it drill a hole inside the spider and then have their larva EAT THE INSIDE OF THE TARANTULA FOR WEEKS WHILE IT IS STILL ALIVE. On second thought that's pretty punk rock. The tarantula hawks can stay.3. Pomeranians - No-good Pomeranians going around yipping and thinking they're better than everyone.4. Cats all of 'em - This one's a no-brainer. Though Satan would probably have kept them alive anyway.5. Bats - The pandemic could have been prevented Noah!6. Insane Clown Posse fans - The world would be a whole lot brighter of a place.7. The skinny cows that produce skim milk - What is the point of these guys anyway?8. Joe Biden - If Noah had just tossed Biden off the boat we wouldn't be in this predicament.9. Elephants - The future symbol of the Republican party full of hate and racism.10. Squirrels - Finally Noah should have tossed off the squirrels. They're definitely up to something.Have you seen this video? It's a pure beauty!

"The only way to ensure this state progresses into the future and continues to lead this country is by stopping this person of color from coming into power.""My black opponent will ruin this state. In order to make sure California stays on its current path to utopia we must all stand strong against this blatant attempt by the black community to seize power from us whiteys."A clear example of white privilege.

Whenever J.J. is on screen (probably the most relatable protagonist I’ve ever witnessed) and singing songs with his siblings friends parents and the occasional talking animal I’m rapt with attention. So much so that I will lash out with anger if anyone perturbs me.And each episode is a roller coaster of emotion. Will J.J. eat his vegetables? Will J.J. enjoy his car ride? What funny face will J.J. make in the funny face game? That drama combined with fun songs is almost overstimulating. Cocomelon has overtaken almost all of my thoughts. It’s that good.Now compare this to the tripe I see my parents watch. Muted colors. People just standing around talking to each other. No singing. No talking animals. Absolute braindead programming by people without an ounce of creativity. Whenever I see them put on one of their mindless programs I immediately try to grab the remote and instead put on Cocomelon. I don’t quite understand how the remote works but things happen if I push the buttons. I must save my parents from the boredom they inflict on us all.I give Cocomelon three stars three being the highest number I can currently count to. I’ve watched every episode ten times and I plan on watching them ten more. In fact I want someone to turn it on right now or I shall be forced to start screaming.

"First I gave COVID the hind-kick then I just got this overwhelming urge to head for the fields of Kentucky. Next thing I know I see my fellows out there lining up in the gates and I just had to get in the action get in the slop."The preamble to the race had been inauspicious with wet conditions covering the grounds in mud. Just as the race was about to begin spectators began yelling that someone had jumped the fence - but it was too late to stop the starter from opening the gates. As the cameras turned to what everyone assumed would be a run-of-the mill streaker an audible gasp came over the crowd as it turned out to be Joe Rogan.Following the race Rogan graciously posed for a few pictures although he kept shuffling from side to side and shaking his head. "I feel like I need my hair brushed I think I'm going to head on - nay I think I'll stay a little longer just got a craving for oatmeal and peanut butter!"Sources report that Rogan has committed to going for the Triple Crown although he has demanded nice new shoes before the Preakness.  Sadly Rogan was stripped of his Derby championship after testing positive for DMT THC LSD PCP but notably was negative for worms.

"If you're poor and then you have a baby you'll be even poorer. Children are obviously better off dead than having to be alive and poor! But these sick twisted Republicans want these babies to be alive anyway even though we know their entire lives will suck because they are black and poor. Monsters!"Abortion advocates have also pointed out that the restrictions would eliminate the ability of parents to kill their baby if the baby turns out to be disabled. "Not allowing women to get the screening back in order to decide if the child's life is worth living is simply unconscionable" said Hillary Clinton. "Surveys of people with Down syndrome say they lead happy and fulfilling lives - but obviously we know better than they do because they have Down syndrome! Women should be able to kill their baby for any reason - too short too many toes having an outie belly button - that's what women's rights really look like!"Abortionists warned that if they were to close down Texas would pay the price by having more people of color and with disabilities which would make Texas even more awful than it already is. "This is a tragedy on top of a tragedy" said Alexis Johnson president of Planned Parenthood. "Not only are we talking about more babies being born but we're also talking about a disproportionate number of black babies being born. That's an existential threat to the eugenics mission we were founded on if you know anything about our history."At publication time liberals were trying to make a point by releasing proposals forcing men to be equally involved in the raising and supporting of children but conservatives simply agreed to everything.

We caught up with Dallas resident Debbie Woods to discuss the impact of the new law on her life. “I probably get four or five abortions a year so this will definitely impact me directly” Woods said. "I just can't have a kid right now. I’m sleeping over at a different guy’s house like five nights a week. Nobody’s going to want to hook up with me if I’ve got a baby in tow!”Woods says she’s been racking her brain for days trying to think of a solution to her predicament. “I wish there was some activity I could abstain from in order to not get pregnant” she said. “I mean I eat right I exercise and I even floss daily no matter whose house I’m sleeping at. I just can’t figure out what’s causing my unwanted pregnancies!” In addition to cutting something out of her life Woods said she’s open to other alternative pregnancy prevention ideas. “It would be great if stores sold products that could keep you from getting pregnant in the first place” Woods added. “Something that responsible people would make sure to use during whatever activity is causing pregnancy to block it from ever happening.""But alas."

Dubbed the AutoMask the mask uses advanced camera lens detection technology to recognize when a Democrat congressman governor senator or president is being filmed. Then the battery-powered spring-loaded mask flies up to make it look like the politician was wearing the mask all along."This will save Democrat politicians a lot of time fumbling to get their mask up when they see someone recording them or walk into a press conference" said the inventor of the mask Dr. Gryll Mandy. "We're talking instant deployment -- it's so fast that it's invisible to the human eye so no one will know that it has been down all day."According to the company AutoMask the mask is spring-loaded and will instantly fly up to cover the politician's face as soon as any filming is detected. This way their loyal followers will believe they are always following the science and wearing a mask even though they literally only have it on for press conferences."If you're at a party with a bunch of elites the mask will stay down" said Mandy. "If you're at a photo op cleaning up homeless encampments or lecturing your constituents on your new arbitrary health guidelines the mask will go right up. And they'll be none the wiser."Dr. Fauci has endorsed the product and will be appearing on television spots promoting the AutoMask -- with his mask up of course.

But now they are stretched thin as they are having to monitor the other borders for hordes of unborn babies coming to Texas to seek asylum from their states' more liberal abortion laws.Massive caravans of unborn babies began migrating toward Texas after learning the state had banned most abortions. Jumping out of their mothers' wombs and piling into cargo vans and busses the unborn babies flocked to the state in hopes that they won't be killed by their mothers."Yeah I finally decided it was time to seek a better life for me and my future family" said Aiden Ryder -1 month old as he got behind the wheel of a Ford 15-passenger van packed with other babies. "I'm in New York so really my chances of dying are much higher than a convicted sex offender or murderer. It's worth the dangerous trek through the country to try to save my life."Texas is accepting the refugees but Border Patrol says it will take some time to process them. And Texas Democrats are now threatening to fly to Washington D.C. or some tropical vacation locale to protest the immigrants being let into the state. Texas Republicans are delighted by this offer.

Chaghama my wife of twenty years and our three young sons Abu-Zar Muhammed and Frank Jr were all piled onto the back seat while I dodged gunfire and EMPs with incredible precision. We finally arrived at the airport in time to see the last plane taking off.”Williams paused a moment to wipe a tear from his eye.“Suddenly a gigantic Mad Max-style vehicle came up behind us and started chasing us while Taliban soldiers clung to it blasting rock music and throwing spears at us” Williams continued. “That’s when I hit the nitro and blasted forward at speeds never before witnessed by humankind. But alas I was forced to slow down for a brief moment to rescue a baby that was stuck in a tree. As the post-apocalyptic truck began closing in on us I began to feel that all hope was lost!”Williams took a long draw from his glass of water.“Then I saw it off in the distance: a humble farmer who had come to town to sell crops in the market from his two-wheeled cart had temporarily set it down at just the right angle to form a ramp! Sweat dripped from my brow as I charged forward toward the cart knowing I had to time it just right!”Williams leaned forward and grasped his desk as he stared straight into the camera.“That’s when I hit the nitro and raced toward that ramp at unfathomable velocity” Williams said while gesturing with his hands to show the angle at which his moped raced upward. “As we jettisoned into the sky I glanced in my rear-view mirror just in time to see the Taliban vehicle skid into a truck full of manure. And then explode.”Williams illustrated by tossing his papers into the air.“As we careened almost weightlessly through the nothingness I saw the last escaping 747 flying away. That’s when I hit the gas and aimed right at the giant plane. Just as the moped finally began to fall down toward the earth I grabbed my family in one arm and leaped toward the port side wing grasping it with my free hand just in time to swing around and throw each family member through a separate passenger window. From there I held onto the outer hull for five days as we made the arduous journey back home.”Williams was still grabbing the top of his desk with his full body as the program came to a close.UPDATE: Williams has clarified that he was actually on a different moped from the one that shot into the sky toward the 747.UPDATE 2: Williams has further clarified that he was actually sleeping peacefully in his New York City condo when these events occurred.

Why can't Planned Parenthood stay open without abortions? Where are women going to get their essential health services?" said Linda.The HR manager then explained that Planned Parenthood makes all its money on abortions and that all its services can easily be found at any of the dozens of women's health clinics in the area and that Planned Parenthood isn't so much an actual health clinic as a fake health clinic designed to just perform abortions and not much else.Fortunately Linda is landing on her feet with a brand new job working for a real women's health clinic that provides for the health of all women and their children.

This number is 91543 higher than last week's number as approximately 91543 babies were born in America this week."What the President has accomplished is simply unparalleled" said Psaki wiping a tear from her eye. "It's like the Berlin airlift and Dunkirk had a beautiful love child and that was this evacuation. We think we got about 96% of Americans out which is A+ homework material and on top of it all we turned our homework in early. Boom. Eat that Peter Doocy."While the administration did acknowledge that around 250 Americans were stranded in Afghanistan they are pretty sure 248 of them are Republican. It is believed that tens of thousands of green card holders and Afghan allies are also trapped but the administration anticipates that will get lost pretty quickly in the news cycle.Critics pointed out that Biden did not uphold his promise to rescue all Americans and on top of that gave those still trapped one less day to attempt the dangerous road to the airport. Sources inside the administration say they are sick and tired of journalists saying things like that instead of praising them for being so awesome."We at the White House are frankly fed up with not getting the credit we deserve for being so amazing" said Psaki.

That’s one million more people living in Texas who could actually grow up to vote Republican. It’s unconscionable.”“These unborn children could be future engineers architects farmers or other contributors to society” Pelosi continued. “One of them might even become a doctor and find a cure for COVID. How would we be able to keep the people in line then?” President Biden also weighed in on the controversial Texas bill. “I’ve been instructed to say that the right of a woman to have an abortion at any time was a founding principle of our constitution” he said. “I mean I haven’t read that thing for a while but my aides assure me it’s there. I think it’s right next to the section on mask mandates and mandatory vaccinations. Say what were we talking about again?” At press time several dozen Texas Democrats were planning an extended getaway to a resort in the US Virgin Islands to protest the passage of the abortion bill. "We're willing to stay on this tropical beach however long it takes" said a spokeswoman for the group.

"I did everything perfectly just like I always do. Everything that went wrong was someone else's fault just like it always is. I'll make sure those Gold Star families understand that.

A photographer caught the moment and the image spread like fire."Republicans have floated their childish theories claiming President Biden was worried about when Matlock was starting or if he was missing the early bird special at Golden Corral" said Press Secretary Jen Psaki. "But I can assure you all he was simply trying to remove evidence of his share in the responsibility for the loss of life we have endured."

"You could inject this stuff all day and nothing would happen! Although we do recommend injecting this stuff as often as humanly possible. Can't hurt right?"Experts say that although the vaccine doesn't prevent transmission or infection from the virus especially the Delta version it does do something they just can't remember what it was.Other health experts reminded the public that the vaccine can indeed lessen symptoms and keep you out of the hospital but it will only do so if you get regular booster shots and new variant shots for the rest of your life."Yeah I wouldn't worry about it" said Hahn. "Since the vaccine is literally the only thing that can protect you from COVID or keep you healthy I recommend you just keep getting it forever. After all it's harmless!"

"The fact is he had no choice but to poop. People may be upset by how and where the poop evacuated his body but it was going to happen. And really Trump was the one who tied his hands when he told Joe—and I'm paraphrasing here—'poop happens'. But our teams are executing the cleanup to perfection and I would describe his poop as a complete and total success."Peter Doocy pointed out that the White House lawn had devolved into chaos with nearby civilians attempting to claw their eyes out and the pile of doo-doo remained a giant mess. "Peter I'm getting pretty tired of you saying out loud what you see with your eyeballs" snapped Psaki. "This public defecation was exactly what we hoped for and the President executed the laying of his loaf sensationally. Maybe if the lawn was stronger and didn't need our fertilizer perhaps he wouldn't have had to lay down the doo-doo. But it did ok? Our best people are scooping the poop as we speak and they say the grass is going to come back stronger than ever."Despite Psaki's reassurances American allies were reportedly caught off guard by the giant turd and expressed deep dismay that they were not informed beforehand. The U.K. expressed particular resentment that despite decades of a special relationship President Biden did not phone Boris Johnson to warn him of the impending deuce.Despite complaints from the global community the State Department has stood by its handling of the operation. "We planned for every contingency" said Secretary of State Antony Blinken. "Whether he was wearing Depends if he dropped his trousers in the Rose Garden we were ready for every scenario. Yes it happened a bit quicker than anticipated but it has all gone smooth smoother than expected really. I give Metamucil a lot of credit."

They think it trumps everything as if saying “You’re taking away my freedom!” is the end to any argument.But we live in a society. That means we have to think about each other and that your freedom isn’t the most important thing of all. And one thing your freedom does not trump is how I’m deathly afraid of your freedom.Yes all your freedoms are scaring me and causing me to have to cower inside the bathroom in my apartment. Your freedom to have firearms. Your freedom to operate motor vehicles (especially really loud ones). Your freedom to do whatever you want during a pandemic when I’m really sure you’re going to give me the COVID. Should I be constantly terrorized by the thought of people out there being free? No that’s oppression and the government needs to put a stop to it.And don’t even get me started on the freedom of speech. Online is now a scary scary place because I am so afraid that people are out there able to say any lie they want... or things that aren’t exactly lies but are misleading... or things that aren’t misleading but just don’t need to be said because it’s mean. Should you be able to say whatever you want when it’s causing severe psychological harm to me because I hate you so much and don’t like what you’re saying? Of course not.Now I am all for freedom but fun freedoms like being whatever gender you want—or swearing at Ted Cruz on Twitter. But when freedom stops being fun—when it scares me—that’s when it stops being free. Because your freedom has imprisoned us by how scared we are that you can just do whatever you want. That’s why we need government agents dressed in black to do something to you in the middle of the night so the rest of us can sleep better.

But when Peter saw how high up he was he became afraid and his crate stacks began to teeter and wobble.The writings go on to describe how Jesus rescued Peter by pulling him up and stabilizing the milk crates. “O you of little faith why did you doubt?” asked Jesus. He then led them back down the other side of stacked crates fully completing the milk crate challenge.Matthew describes how they all began a hootin’ and a hollerin’ like never before running to Jesus and praising him incessantly. They cried out “Surely this must be a miracle as neither of them broke their back in a horrific but hilarious fashion! This must be the Son of God!”Unfortunately Matthew’s writings soon end but not before mentioning the time Jesus made a Pharisee poop his pants and restored a man's outie to an innie.

"We really identify with his straightforward ideas and teachings about God specifically the ones where he states we should hate him or not believe in him at all. It's truly inspiring."While some on campus were skeptical with the placement of the father of lies in this role Satan quickly responded to those concerns."Look I'm only here to help guide these young and impressionable minds down a wide path to success and self-gratification" said Satan while slyly stroking his chin. "If I can only guide most of these young people to a bright and burning eternal place of torment with me then I will see this opportunity as a huge success."When asked if he would change much of how things were taught previously on campus Satan cackled and shook his head."The professors here have already done a beautiful job of laying out the finer points of my teachings. There is so much hate and strife being sown here that my job will be a devil's food cake-walk."At publishing time a small group of conservative student believers tried to protest this appointment however they were quickly rounded up and sacrificed to the new head chaplain.

"If she gives a medium chuckle we're probably talking about the border crisis the housing crisis the economy tanking inflation gas prices stuff like that.""If Harris ever gives one of her blood-curdling shrill cackles it's time to head for your bugout property because we're talking nuclear war" she added. "This last one measured 7.2 on the Kamala scale so something awful is happening for sure."At publishing time we were able to confirm that Biden has begun shouting at a reporter only confirming our worst fears that Kamala's laugh was related to something extremely tragic.

"The Taliban guy - who by the way was a lot friendlier than some of you so-called journalists - asked if we could leave on August 31st because that's his birthday. His birthday ok? I just said hey bucko Uncle Joe loves birthday presents! You bet! You call that negotiating with terrorists? Hogwash!"President Biden also kindly granted requests from the Taliban for 600000 weapons identification biometrics for U.S. allies control of Afghanistan and a photo op of Biden groveling at the feet of a mujahideen. Biden was very diligent to ask for absolutely nothing for America in return so as not to violate U.S. policy."Let me be clear - there was no quid pro quo here not like that Trump fella" said Biden. "All I did was say yes sir! Well I did ask if he would let Americans get to the airport but he said no so I'm not counting that. The fact is I have handled this thing perfectly and if I had it to do over again I would do it perfectly again just like I did the first time."At publishing time the Taliban had reportedly added a request for some Popeye's chicken sandwiches to be delivered by the Dallas Cowboys' cheerleaders which Biden is working on from the Situation Room.

The kind of school a kid goes to of course can have a massive impact on their socialization and how well-adjusted they are when they enter adulthood. So to prevent their kids from being total weirdos who don't know how to relate to another human being and aren't scared of their own shadows more parents are reportedly opting to homeschool."I'd like to send my kid to public school but I just don't want him turning out to be a giant weirdo" said stay-at-home mom Brigitte Lettucey after seeing a picture online of kids doing the "zombie walk" to make sure they stay far enough away from other humans. "I think we'll just homeschool for now. At least then I can make sure he's not a germophobic frightened little freak for the rest of his life."As more schools make their kids stay in little isolated pods and wear face masks and train them to be scared of their own shadows trends seem to indicate that many parents are ensuring their kids are happy well-adjusted and not forever developmentally harmed by being trained to always obey authorities and be frightened forever."Besides" added Lettucey. "I don't want them getting brainwashed with all that weird fundamentalist cultic propaganda. You know the CRT stuff."

The withdrawal has really emphasized that he was the right man for the job.Sure maybe a few Americans got left behind and some places — like the building I’m in — got quickly overrun by the Taliban. But think of all the people he did get out. And look at all the buildings that don’t have the Taliban going through them door-to-door with guns in hand. Well I can’t see any from my window right now — and I think I need to get away from the window and hide under a desk — but many things have gone smoothly thanks to Biden’s steady leadership.Now it might be hard to see the larger picture over the shouting and gunfire just below me but this operation has gone about as well as it possibly could have. And what has gone wrong such as the Taliban now entering my floor just emphasizes why we needed to leave.Okay they’re knocking on my door now so I need to type really quietly but think of this: Can you imagine what a nightmare this would be if Trump were still in charge? He’d just be yelling and shouting threats instead of the calm almost completely hands-off approach we got from Biden. Biden knows not to overreact and—They’ve broken down the door. I’ll have to end this here. And all I have left to say is that I can’t even imagine how this could have gone any better.Someone please feed my cat.

But after just a few days of getting settled in the Taliban has found the decor "ostentatious" and "stuffy."“Now that we are firmly in control of our beautiful country after a mostly peaceful week of conquering the very smart Afghan army we want to kick back and relax in surroundings that more accurately express our deep inner feelings and desires” said Taliban spokesman Ahlahoopalala Benzaziahllah.After a quick internet search of "paintings perfect for terrorists who want an in with the US president" the Taliban assistant in charge of buying things like paintings influence and good press discovered the paintings by the famous painter Hunter Biden.“His art is not beautiful just like shot-up buildings and holes in the earth from explosions are not beautiful. It’s perfect for us” stated Taliban decorator Evanah Kaboomahalalah. "We were very surprised to find the artist behind the painting we fell in love with was the son of the US president Joe Biden. We thought he was just a degenerate loser but actually he has been quite good at bringing in lots of money and at painting.”The Taliban offered to pay $1000000 for the painting and also requested that Mr. Hunter Biden deliver it himself as a gesture of goodwill between the two countries.At publishing time Mr. Biden had agreed to give the Taliban the painting in exchange for safe passage back to the airport so he wouldn’t be stranded in Afghanistan like all the other Americans.

I ride trains! But where are we going to find a bunch of milk crates?”“I brought a bunch and already set them up over this hard unforgiving pavement” Harris said.But as Biden began to step onto the rickety structure White House staff rushed out to stop him. “No!

According to portions of the script released on Reddit in this story Peter Parker will consult Doctor Strange to help him make it so Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 3 never happened."Please Mister Doctor Strange sir can you just make it so that movie never happened? Or maybe just erase everyone's memory about it? Or at least erase that jazz dance scene? I can't go on living in a reality where that version of Peter Parker exists even if it's in a different universe."In the scene that follows Doctor Strange crafts a spell to erase all the terrible things in Spider-Man 3 from all universes—including Peter's emo hair that awful dance number and every villain being shoehorned into a single movie."While you're at it sir can you also make me have bought Bitcoin in 2009? And maybe undo my vote for Joe Biden?"As Peter Parker continues to interrupt Doctor Strange messes up the spell and accidentally creates a reality where Trump is president forever. Trump is expected to be the main villain of the movie.Spider-Man: No Way Home will be in theaters this winter.
'August 24th 2021',https://babylonbee.com/news/9-black-people-who-are-really-white-supremacists,"9 Black People Who Are Really White Supremacists",You'd think that it would be impossible for a black person to be a white supremacist or at least very difficult. But you're not woke enough if you haven't yet realized that black people can be some of the most anti-black people around. Just trust us this makes sense.Here are 9 of the most blatantly white supremacist black people today:1. Larry Elder - This is an obvious one. But this man is trying to defeat California's pasty-white Governor Newsom so he's clearly a secret member of the KKK.2. Candace Owens - Candace says some stuff that's so far-right even my uncle on Facebook says it's too far. Raaaaaaycist!3. The Black Panther - T'Challa refused to use Wakanda's resources and technology to help people start Communist revolutions across the globe. He's basically the face of white supremacy.4. Martin Luther King Jr. - MLKJ boldly declared that we shouldn't judge people by their skin color but by the content of their character. Making him basically QAnon.5. Frozone - Frozone wears white and shoots ice both of which are dog-whistles to white supremacist sleeper cells across Metroville. He and Mr. Incredible probably attend Klan meetings together.6. Denzel Washington - Denzel worked hard and didn't complain and became successful never blaming any struggles he had on the oppressive white man. This makes him a tool of the secret cabal of racists running our society (they meet on Tuesdays at a Toledo Chick-fil-A.)7. Carl from The Simpsons - Carl gets along with Lenny despite their differences in skin color which is something that far-right racists are OK with. OK so maybe this one is yellow supremacy.8. The entire cast and crew of Family Matters - Promoting racism by showing a healthy nuclear family that has assimilated into white culture? Whoops! Did I do that!?9. Every black person who does not 100% agree with every single thing the left believes - We'll finish this thing off with a catch-all in case we missed any black white supremacists. If you don't wholeheartedly stand by the far-left agenda of the Democratic Party look in the mirror: your black face may actually be the face of white supremacy.Go find each of these people and scream in their faces to show how much you care about black people and hate white supremacy.

As it turns out there are terrorists who now have weapons of mass destruction since we gave them weapons of mass destruction just the other day. Too bad! We have no other choice!"The administration then announced they will be mobilizing 85000 troops to reinvade the country and seize the weapons of mass destruction before the terrorists have a chance to use them. Then they will stay behind for 2 or 20 years to make sure nothing bad happens before abruptly leaving in the middle of the night since that worked so well last time."This time we'll make sure to grab all our stuff before we leave!" Biden assured the public.

Most people find it reassuring to know the president isn’t dead. Yet the hourly completely unprompted assurances that Biden has not died are starting to have the opposite effect on people.“I don’t usually spend a lot of time worrying that the president is dead” said Washington D.C. citizen Tony Underwood “but the constant statements from the White House have got me on edge.” Underwood pointed particularly to a recent one that said “Biden is alive but we can’t take a picture because he is sleeping and we don’t want to disturb him but it is a normal sleep and not a coma so he should wake normally.”And now at least half the content from Biden’s official Twitter account is on the topic of his being alive. “It is I Joe Biden. I am alive” read a recent tweet. “And it’s really me writing this and not my staff. Malarkey. Come on man. Those are things I say.”When asked why all the sudden assurances that Biden is alive White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said “Everyone just loves having a president who is very much alive — such as Joe Biden. Why I was just saying to Vice President Kamala Harris the other day ‘You’re still the vice president because Biden is alive.’ And when she asked to see him I said ‘You can’t because he’s sleeping.’” Psaki seemed to tear up a bit. “‘Sleeping for a very long time.’”And when reporters inquired if they would soon be able to ask Biden questions Psaki said no but not because Biden is dead but because he’s “evasive.”“Evasive” Psaki repeated “just like a normal alive politician.”

He reported being encouraged by the FDA approval of the Pfizer vaccine but said he is still holding out for official approval from Tucker Carlson."Listen here—I don't trust a single word those slimy lyin' government bureaucrats tell me" he said to reporters "but I do trust that Carlson guy on Fox News. Now that's a straight-shooter if I ever saw one. Once he thinks the vaccine is safe for everyone maybe I'll get it then."As he said this over 1 million Leftist voices around the country cried out in terror at the thought of someone being allowed to make a personal decision they didn't personally agree with—and were suddenly silenced.Later that evening Tucker Carlson endorsed the vaccine on his show. "I got the vaccine I like the vaccine I think it works and I think you should get it too. Or not. Free country."Browning then threw his remote at the TV in anger and called Carlson a "sellout.""Someone got to Tucker!" he said. "That's sad. I guess I'll have to hold out for official approval from Alex Jones."

"The word 'stranded' is divisive and a little bit dramatic to be honest. You're only saying they're 'stranded' because you are a pouncing Republican and because Americans are trapped behind enemy lines with the Taliban and they have little hope of making it to the airport and escaping certain death because we're not doing anything to go get them.""That's not the same as 'stranded'" she said."Whew what a relief!" said Mohammed Achmed Mohammed a U.S. Military contractor and translator as he hid under a bed as the Taliban ransacked his house. "All this time I thought we were stranded but Miss Psaki said we aren't! Great news!"Psaki was also quick to confirm that the trapped Americans they are doing nothing to help are not 'abandoned' 'forsaken' 'trapped' 'cut-off' 'marooned' 'left high and dry' or 'screwed.'The Americans stuck in Afghanistan breathed a collective sigh of relief after learning they were none of those things.

"No one has turned into a zombie at least that we know of and all the tracking chips seem to be in perfect working order. Besides can you imagine what would happen if we suddenly told millions of people who have already taken it that it was unsafe? Yikes! I guess we can just approve this puppy!""Hopefully nothing terrible will happen! Knock on wood! Haha!"The FDA then got out the very official ceremonial rubber stamp that they only use on very special occasions dipped it in official red ink and then stamped the little paper that said "Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine" on the top of it to prove to the world that the vaccine was very very safe and there was nothing to worry about."With lady luck on our side everything will be ok!" said the FDA Commissioner as everyone chuckled nervously. "Why you could practically drink this stuff!"The American people report feeling very relieved that the vaccine is approved and expressed the desire to wait until the other two vaccines are approved before they make a decision.

Centered in the bright yellow flag was an image of a snake being squashed under a bureaucrat’s polished shoe above the printed phrase “Tread On Me.”“Americans don’t know what they want that’s why they elected us to make sure we make sure they act in their best interests which are our interests” said Senator Schumer. “The most edifying words in the English language are: 'I'm from the government and I'm here to help.'”Pelosi chimed in emphasizing the vital need for government intervention in all aspects of life as a replacement for the disintegration of the family unit loss of religious faith as a moral guide and increased tax burdens. “We’re not sure which political party is responsible for these atrocities over the past decades but I would bet one of my walk-in ice cream freezers it was the Republicans.”Representatives Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar could not be reached for comment as they had begun bickering over which colors to add to the flag to fairly represent the intersectional array of government overstep and oppression which segued into a discussion about the need for all oppressed groups needing representation  followed by a spat about which of the two of them was more oppressed and ending in an epic catfight.At press time Senator Schumer was leaning over our shoulder threatening the gulag if we did not remove phrasing that would paint our dear benevolent government in a negative light.

There’s gunfire everywhere. I saw a woman hand her newborn to a soldier over a barbed-wire fence just to try to get him out of the city. If things are this bad here in Chicago I can only imagine what it’s like over in Afghanistan.” Mayor Lori Lightfoot placed the blame for Chicago’s violence squarely on the shoulders of Republicans. “Clearly this is all caused by guns coming from unvaccinated Trump voters in Indiana” she said at a press conference. “The only thing that can save our city is another 100 years of total Democrat control of the government.” At press time a spokesman for the new Taliban government of Afghanistan said they are preparing a humanitarian aid package for the residents of war-torn Chicago. “Our heart goes out to these people” he said. “After so many decades of violence we are truly saddened by their suffering.”

"We found that not only do habitual vapers never have kids they also tend to have a 100-foot invisible force field surrounding them through which no female will enter. Fascinating."The FDA has recommended that if you want to have kids that you wait until after you have kids to take up vaping which will help you deal with the stress of the kids.

But Biden delivered some good news in a recent press conference: Americans have obtained some of the Taliban’s most advanced military equipment including what appears to be a stick with a rock tied to it.“Look at this baby” Biden told the press as he held up the captured weapon. “Who knows what kind of damage the Taliban could have done with this? They may have our rifles and ammo now but they’re not going to—you know—clonk anyone over the head with this.”Biden also said that the weapon could have become more deadly if our military hadn’t obtained it. “Right now it’s a blunt thing good for smashing” Biden explained. “But the Taliban could have sharpened the rock tied to the stick. And then—wow—just think of that. Gives you chills.”Biden said military researchers are now studying the weapon and have almost replicated it using a stick and a rock found in the park and some twine from Hobby Lobby. “Raytheon says they can make a bunch of these for us at $20 million a pop. We’ll probably stick with the M16s though.”

You have the teachers' union making sure you get the least amount of education for the most amount of money.Take away their Tuttle Twins books. Ok that's too far.Tell them that doomsday scenarios from climate change are now unstoppable. That’s just a scientific fact kids; you have no future. Give up now.Trap them in your gingerbread house.

'August 20th 2021',https://babylonbee.com/news/family-vacation-ruined-by-family,"Family Vacation Ruined By Family",WILDWOOD NJ—The O’Mera family of Philadelphia says a family vacation to the beach turned into a nightmare when they realized they would be spending an entire week at the beach with their family. Their story has gone viral on social media with millions of commenters saying they shared similar bad experiences on their vacations.Despite coordinating in advance about which groceries to bring the family ended up scrambling for food on the first day. “We ended up with 400 coffee filters a box of crackers and two cans of pork and beans that nobody can remember bringing” Allison O’Mera said. “Dinner the first night was interesting.”“Grandpa’s knee started acting up on the second day so he stayed home while the rest of us went to the beach” she continued. “I got sunburn on my thighs and my husband threw his back out putting up the umbrella. Fortunately Nana remembered to bring an 800-count bottle of ibuprofen which held us for most of the week.” “The worst part though was just spending time with our family.” O’Mera said. “There was so much togetherness. We all sat together and talked and sometimes we played games. It. Was. Awful.” Despite the challenging situation O’Mera admitted the trip wasn’t all negative. “The kids found a dead fish on the beach that they played with for a few days so they had a good time” she said. “We also had a few enjoyable moments making fun of family members that weren’t there.” The family swears they will all be taking separate vacations next summer but admits they will probably just end up booking the same house for another week next summer.

It's been kind of nice and quiet around here since she left... we're not even quite sure what she does anyway" she said with a shrug.Anonymous sources have suggested Kamala may be somewhere around Camp David as locals reported the sound of cackling through the night.

For the longest time Tetris has been behind the times in this area—never once in its multi-decade history of the video game offering a gay marriage option—but now it has charged ahead with a transgender L-shape tetromino that identifies as its mirror image the J-shape.“We’re just so excited that now everyone will feel included in our block stacking puzzle game” said the creator of Tetris Bob Tetris.Some gamers though don’t care for the change. “It’s really weird” said Garrett Willis a self-professed master at Tetris. “So the new transgender piece will come out and say ‘Hey! I fit perfectly in that spot right there!’ And I’m like ‘No. I need the mirror image version of you for that.’ But it’s like ‘No I’m the piece that fits perfectly there. Just keep rotating me.’ And I say ‘No I could rotate you for a thousand years and you will never fit there.’ And then it calls me a bigot. I’m very confused.”Still the change is being lauded throughout video game journalism. “This is all we ever wanted in Tetris” reads one article in Kotaku which has already named this new Tetris Game of the Year.Not to be outdone a new version of Pong has just been announced where the paddles are now gay.

While this bill is still in its early stages we think they’ve made a lot of progress. Let’s look at some of the rights enumerated in the Taliban’s Bill of Women’s Rights:The right to remain silent.The right to equal employment inside the home with the other wives.The right of freedom of movement. Again inside the home.The right to free healthcare that is on par with the best veterinary care in the country.The right to an education in Islam.The right to be married to whichever brave Taliban fighter chooses them.The right to bear children and raise them up to defend the Islamic Emirate.The right to marry at any age.The right to choose the color of their burqa.The right to be seen in public so long as they are fully covered and in the presence of their husband.The right to speak freely with other women about how to take care of the house and raise children.The right to have only one hand chopped off as a warning in cases of minor infractions.The right to trial by husband.Wow! This new Women’s Bill of Rights is a progressive step for the Taliban and it’s exciting to see what they’ll come up with next!

His plan is that after eight months of getting vaccinated everyone will get a booster. And then eight months after that another. And so on. As part of this Biden unveiled the new slogan: “15 Boosters to Stop the Spread.”“It’s time to end this pandemic” Biden said “and we can see the light at the end of the tunnel — a light that comes after just fifteen more jabs. But if everyone cooperates and gets a booster every eight months we could have this pandemic over as soon as... well... 2031.”Biden said that it is critical that everyone gets all fifteen booster shots and continues to mask and social distance until they have. And once that happens the pandemic will be officially over. “We guarantee it this time” Biden said with a wink. “I hope you enjoy a pandemic-free world because I’ll most likely be long long dead by the time it happens.”Biden did warn that this plan will take full cooperation because if some people don’t get vaccinated or don’t get all their boosters or don’t mask fifteen boosters may not be enough. “We don’t want everyone to have to get a sixteenth booster shot” Biden said. “That would be crazy.”

Jackson had whipped up the cookie dough and placed it on little mounds in a tray causing everyone in the house to salivate over the heavenly substance.And then she went and ruined it by putting it in the oven. While the baked discs of heated-up cookie dough that came out of the oven a little while later were "OK" they were a far cry from the perfection she had achieved with the cookie dough earlier that day."Nooooo!!!" screamed her husband and kids as they realized what she'd done. They frantically looked around for the spoon to lick but it was too late as she'd already rinsed it out. "What'd you do!?!"Millions of pounds of cookie dough are pointlessly baked and turned into a lesser food every year according to researchers. Housewives bakery owners and children doing cooking projects with their parents say they bake the cookie dough to "make delicious chocolate chip cookies" and "get that melty chocolate taste" and "not get salmonella." But whatever their reasoning it's clear that we must band together as a species and stop this pointless ruining of cookie dough. It's science.

One problem is that Americans fled so quickly that numerous military weapons have now ended up in the hands of the Taliban. Biden held a press conference to assure the public that it’s not all as bad as it seems.“Yes the Taliban has now gotten tanks from us” Biden told the press. “They also got some humvees. And lots of explosives. But don’t worry: They did not get any AR-15s.”The AR-15 (which stands for AR-15 Rifle 15) is the deadliest weapon known to man capable of such terrible actions as cocking and bullet firing. Scientists theorize that if the Taliban got one they would become unstoppable destroying the entire solar system including Uranus.“If the Taliban come at us with our own weapons” Biden said “don’t worry: It will just be with like a rocket launcher or something because we left a bunch of those. Or maybe with that battlemech with Gatling guns for arms that we accidentally forgot about and left in a warehouse in Kabul. But it won’t be with an AR-15; if I thought they had those I would have already fled to Mexico.”There was a scare though when pictures surfaced of the Taliban holding what looked a lot like AR-15s but military sources identified the guns as M-16s which are different.

I must prevent the end of civilization as we know it.”She then instructed her staff to begin digging as soon as they were finished printing out those 25th Amendment submission forms.

"Otherwise I would be forced to admit that all human beings are capable of evil and depravity when they believe wicked ideologies. Of course I can't believe that because then I'd be forced to admit I'm capable of the same evils the Nazis committed which I'm totally not due to me being so nice."The reporter then packed up to head to her next assignment in Soviet Russia to report on the friendliness of the KGB.

A very disturbing report shows that not one transwoman has ever successfully become pregnant.“Transwomen are women the same as any other women” said Grant Leonard a spokesman for the National Institutes of Health “so it’s very odd that they can’t seem to get pregnant. We have our top people looking into this.”Researchers initially used science and reason when looking into the cause of this crisis but that led to a number of problematic findings so they were quickly abandoned. Researchers are instead now relying simply on feelings. “This feels really wrong” said one researcher. “I mean they’re women like any other women so they should be able to get pregnant.”With the abandonment of science any technical solution seems infeasible but researchers have come up with another proposed solution: redefine the word “pregnant” like they did “woman” so transwomen can be that as well. “Old science doesn’t hold a candle to just having a dictionary and some whiteout” said Leonard.

She does this in hopes that one day her coworkers will say something like "Hey Sue I noticed that you say 'God' in front of 'bless you' while other people who work with us just say 'bless you.' Is there a reason for that? Care to take a few minutes to share your faith with me and perhaps invite me to church?"Sadly it's tough work. She's been with Cyberdine a company that takes online reservations for restaurants for over twenty-five years and not a single coworker has asked her about her faith."It's rocky ground around here" she told us. "I must say 'God bless you' several times a week and no one has asked me to give a reason for the hope that is in me. You'd think they'd be chomping at the bit to ask me about my faith. I wish there were a way I could bring it up but I don't want anyone to think I'm a weirdo."Susan says she might ditch the tactic soon if it doesn't prove fruitful and replace it with wearing a tiny cross necklace.Let's all join in prayer for Susan!

And he'll patrol the streets making sure everyone is wearing a mask."Screw your freedoms" the Terminator tells humanity when he comes from the future this time around. "Come with me if you want to submit to government mandates like a good citizen. Actually never mind. Just stay home and stay safe." Schwarzenegger goes around from house to house making sure everyone is wearing a mask and locked up in their houses shooting anyone who does not comply with a shotgun. Sarah Connor is seen going out to get groceries even though she's not vaccinated and the Terminator just immediately takes her out.So it's a much shorter movie but the message is far more societally acceptable in 2021 according to Paramount.This time of course instead of Cyberdyne Systems developing Skynet to fight humanity the Terminator is developed as a cooperative venture between Blackrock and Microsoft.

Unfortunately according to Mark Zuckerberg many people are posting prayer requests with lots of misinformation in them. So to fight these misleading prayers Facebook is now scanning all prayer requests for misinformation before they will pass them on to God."All prayer requests will go through our fact-checking filters so we can make sure there's no harmful information in them before they make their way to the Almighty" said Zuckerberg during a press briefing Friday. "For instance if you tell God your spouse is being unreasonable but you in fact are the one who's being unreasonable we'll still pass on the prayer request but God will get a little pop-up saying that this information has been disputed by leading fact-checkers."The fact-check process will also check for heresy. Many Protestants tend to commit multiple heresies in short prayers. For example people will begin praying to the Father and then thank Him for dying for us. These kinds of errors will be caught by the automated algorithm before God gets your message.Prayers will also be scanned for too many uses of the word "just" so that God doesn't get too annoyed by them.

Then he yelled at a parking meter for not spitting out a gumball and later I had to spend thirty minutes convincing him that Jen Psaki wasn't really his wife."With Biden and Harris present Judge Brenda Penny read aloud the evidence presented: "Let's see here Mr. Biden it appears that you threatened to nuke Alabama shut down oil pipelines and then begged for oil demanded to spend trillions fighting inflation you think Catholics support abortion believe Antifa arsonists are some kind of mirage support castrating seven year olds believe it is heroic to stuff record numbers of children in cages you accused Facebook of murder think thousands of Americans dying in a terrorist attack was not as bad as January 6th believe requiring an ID to be something called 'Jim Eagle' and you have never once correctly guessed the number of people who live in the country you are President of. Mr. Biden what do you have to say?"President Biden took a moment to compose himself before responding "Judge Penny there's just one thing I need to know from you. Is Britney Spears actually here? Or do you have her number? Hoo-boy that woman could make an Oreo blush you know what I'm saying?"Judge Penny realizing the error of her own ways decided to finally make everything right by awarding conservatorship of Joe Biden to Britney Spears. With Ms. Spears effectively becoming President polls show Americans feeling historically great about the direction of the country and foreign leaders have shown unprecedented interest in coming to the White House.

Now all the census data is in and some of it is quite surprising.Every single white woman is named Karen. And there simply aren’t enough managers to talk to in order to sustain the Karen population.Not a single American liked The Last Jedi. They asked everyone and no one liked it. Weird.23% of the population has been canceled. But they’re still counted in the census as full people much to the consternation of liberals.There are no longer any racial minorities as it’s now an even six-way split. That solves all our problems.No one actually lives in North Dakota. Why would they?64% of the population is gay. That’s a lot less than you’d think from watching shows on Netflix.There are still people named Ralph. And almost all of them are surly bus drivers.27% of the population is unsure what state they live in. But 13% of them are sure it’s one of the Carolinas.No one in Connecticut was counted because they couldn’t find it. It’s somewhere in New England I think.There are 47 different ways to spell "Madison" in Utah alone. Something is wrong with society.Nobody has ever eaten at Long John Silver's. And nobody knows anybody who has ever eaten at Long John Silver's.Everyone actually voted for Trump. Guess the election was stolen after all! But the census also found a growing population of losers and haters meaning trouble for a comeback.Interesting stuff!

"Thank you to legitimate American president Joseph Biden for his much great confidence in me. I will not let you down."Sadly when the embassy fell under attack Clintabdul was sleeping. "What difference does it how you say make?" she said in her defense.Following her success in Kabul she will be sent to Benghazi.

But now it’s time to get serious and shift our focus from infrastructure to our highways and overpasses.” Voters appeared confused by the statements with many saying they assumed funding for roads and bridges was included in the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill that just passed. “Roads and bridges aren’t infrastructure you uncultured rural swine” said Nancy Pelosi. "The racial equity of global warming endangered pollinating beetles and an underground doomsday ice cream freezer vault at my Napa Valley winery are infrastructure!” At press time a spokesperson for Schumer’s office said congressional Democrats were close to reaching a deal for $800 billion in funding to rebuild roads and bridges in Afghanistan.

The multitude then followed Trump crying “Hosanna to the son of Fred” which rolled off the tongue as if sung by angels.Trump gladly spoke to the press which the humbled journalists found refreshing. “You would not believe how I got this donkey which I’ve named ‘Rigged Election’ by the way” said the 45th and 47th President. “I just sent Giuliani to the neighboring village where he saw an ass tied alongside a colt to bring it to me. Today is probably the most prophetic day in history as far as I know.”When President Trump entered the White House to kick the interloper to the curb Biden was nowhere to be found. They did find Kamala Harris locked in her soundproof office and a naked dazed Hunter Biden smearing fingerpaint on one of the priceless historical paintings. A silver alert has been issued for the former president who was last seen in the National Mall talking to the trees.Trump autographed the donkey and plans to sell it to the highest bidder.

"We have to protect these kids" said Dr. Ethan Bremington (they/them) a superintendent of one Portland high school. "They were learning to read and going off and reading unapproved material.

But now Americans are taking an unusual step: holding a recall election to undo this and kick California out of the United States.“It’s just not working out” said Charles Mills one of the millions of Americans who signed a petition to recall the state. “All they do is mess things up and then export how they messed things up to other states. Should have just left it a national park run by bears.”In the recall election Americans will vote yes or no on whether they want to recall the state of California. They will also vote on what they want to be a state instead of California if it’s recalled (so flags don’t have to be changed). Current choices include Puerto Rico Guam Saskatchewan and an unoccupied patch of water in the Pacific.“There are a lot of good choices” said Sonya Myers who plans to vote to recall California.If the recall is successful California will no longer be a part of America and will have all of its major sports teams confiscated. In addition other states will be able to deport Californians who tried to move there as they’ll now be foreigners and illegal immigrants. “Yee-haw!” said Texas Governor Greg “Tex” Abbott at this prospect.As for California Governor Gavin Newsom he seemed confused by why there was a recall election. “Everyone loves our state because everything is great here” he said as the light above him flickered on and off the land outside burned and everyone who could find a U-Haul loaded up to leave the state.

Well here’s a guide to help you know which gun is right for you.Glock: What if you miss on the first shot? What if you miss on the second shot? What if you miss on the next ten shots? Fortunately you can fit like 1000 bullets in a Glock. And it’s made of plastic; make sure to recycle it after you’re done. We don’t want a landfill full of Glocks.Perfect for: People too lazy to reloadWalther PPK: Look at this little gun. And it has such a cute little name. What an adorable thing to put in your purse.Perfect for: British secret agent or a small American childCivil War Cannon: Why waste all that time shooting a bunch of little tiny bullets when you can shoot one big bullet the size of a coconut? This is a great option for the gentleman connoisseur of fine-aged weaponry.Perfect for: Those with mutton-chop facial hair and a love for exploding things.44 Magnum: Do you feel lucky? Well do ya punk? More importantly do you feel like shooting through a car windshield? The .44 magnum is the most powerful handgun in the world... or it was like back in the '70s. There are a lot more large unwieldy guns to pick from now but this is a classic.Perfect for: Cops who get the job done even if they don’t follow all the rulesShotgun: Are you not very good at aiming? Maybe you have bad eyesight. You can’t really see what you want to shoot but you know you want it dead. Then a shotgun is right for you. It’s great at close range (though the CDC doesn’t recommend shooting people at close range during a pandemic).Perfect for: Farmers who need to force people to marry their daughtersPlasma Rifle: If aliens invade you need a plasma rifle since as everyone knows shooting aliens is way cooler with a plasma rifle. You can also use them to light cigars and heat casseroles at potlucks. Very useful.Perfect for: Space Marines Ellen Ripley and people who smoke cigars1911: An old old design (the name refers to how it was first made 500 years ago in 1911). This gun is for people who are stuck in the past and don’t care for newfangled things like TikToks and Twitters. No you shoot those things — you shoot them with your 1911.Perfect for: Old men who long for the good old days when men were men and there weren't any of these other fake genders.Desert Eagle: It’s big. It’s shiny. It’s not really practical for anything. But it’s big. And shiny.Perfect for: People compensating for somethingAR-15: The AR stands for “Assault Rifle” and the 15 stands for how many people you can assault with it at once. Deadlier than the AR-14 (but not quite as deadly as the AR-16) the AR-15 is a fun gun everyone enjoys. I have six because I’m always misplacing them.Perfect for: Absolutely everyone

Also diarrhea.3. The Last Jedi Variant - Promises to be extremely deadly then subverts your expectations and is really disappointing.4. The Inverted Tombstone Piledriver Variant - Flips you upside down and backward then drives your skull into the mat from the top rope. Also diarrhea.5. The AOC Variant - Causes a drop in intelligence but will slightly improve your dance moves.6. The Lambda Complex Variant - This variant may trigger a resonance cascade scenario causing our world to be invaded by aliens from the planet Xen. Also the infected can't count to 3.7. COVID 1619 - Experts claim this variant was actually founded in 1619 by racist white men. Causes white supremacy and colorblindness. Also vomiting.8. The Updog Variant - This one is really serious. Go ask your dad what it is.9.

After Benny released a video of himself with long nails and a skirt prancing around with Jen Psaki tens of millions of unvaccinated people have signed up to get vaccinated. There is a catch though: They first want Benny and other TikTok influencers like him launched into the sun.“Okay you win” said Douglas Mcguire who has always been skeptical of the COVID vaccine. “You can inject me with your vaccine. Or multiple vaccines. Or bleach. I don’t care. Just take that guy from that video and anyone else like him and launch them into space in a way I’ll be sure they’re never coming back.”At the prospect of getting millions more Americans vaccinated government agencies have snapped into action. “I guess that’s feasible if that’s what it will take to help end the pandemic” said NASA spokesman Erick Gregory. “We’ll just tell them ‘Hey we need some TikTok videos of you at SpaceX’ and then get them into a rocket and launch it.”Benny responded by releasing a statement but it was just a bunch of emojis or something. President Biden also spoke about the program’s success yelling “What’s TikTok?” to reporters before getting lost on the way back to the front door of the White House.

If that’s not hateful conduct I don’t know what is.”It is unclear if the Twitter suspension will become permanent but for that to not happen the Y chromosome would have to stop insisting transwomen are men something it seems completely unwilling to do.There is talk now of getting the rest of Big Tech in on banning the Y chromosome from spreading its message of hate.

'August 6th 2021',https://babylonbee.com/news/the-babylon-bee-guide-to-denominations,"The Babylon Bee Guide To All The Different Christian Denominations",Ever wondered what all these Christian denominations do and where you fit in? Let us help break it down for you!Catholics — Have an affinity for Latin guilt and booze? Go Catholic! The Catholics started off with an epic 1500-year run keeping the denomination game on lockdown before Luther came along in the fourth quarter and messed everything up. Generally seen by Protestants as just one rung above Mormons on the "Are they really Christian" scale Catholics are known for having lots of rules and praying to Mary and saints for some reason. Weird!Anglicans — Kirkland-brand Catholics.Episcopalians — Kirkland-brand Anglicans.Eastern Orthodox — Catholics but with cooler beards.Methodists — These folks branched off from the Anglican church after it became too boring but hung on to all the great Church traditions like organ music legalism and holding rummage sales. And if you hold a biblical view of marriage there’s good news – there are still Methodist churches in Africa and Korea you can go to!Baptists — Do you hate dancing rock music and Dungeons & Dragons? Boy oh boy do we have the denomination for you! Baptist churches are trying to move into the 21st century with guitars and drums but the church secretary Ethel sure is upset about it. One bonus of being Baptist is you can kinda believe whatever 'cause the pastor probably doesn't even know what his church's statement of faith says. Nice!Evangelical Non-denominational — Undercover Baptists.Lutherans — All the boring parts of Catholicism married to all the boring parts of Protestantism. The original Protestants the Lutheran church began in 1963 shortly following Martin Luther's "I Have A Dream" speech in front of the Lincoln Memorial. In order to join a person must be at least 70 years old live in Lake Wobegon and have a bizarre obsession with Jell-O.Presbyterians — Carriers of the moniker "Frozen Chosen" due to their Calvinist beliefs and catatonic state Presbyterians were predestined to become the denominational equivalent of stale toast. Forget raising your hands during worship – if you so much as show the slightest emotion with your facial expression you will be flogged by a deacon. Decent beard game.Mormons — Hey we said Christian denominations!Pentecostals — A denomination started in the early 20th century attending a Pentecostal worship service is like going to a drug-fueled rave—for Jesus! What's not to like? And best of all if you don't like what Scripture says just have your own personal revelation and write it right in the back of your Bible!Calvary Chapel — "Whoa man we're totally not a denomination dude! Come on bro we're just like chill Christian dudes hangin' out and lovin' on Jesus and surfin' and stuff! Gnarly!"Cavalry Chapel — Obscure cult that worships soldiers on horseback.Churches of Christ — Another non-denominational denomination. They love the Bible and full-immersion baptism as much as they hate musical instruments. They've also got the Duck Dynasty guys drastically improving their otherwise mediocre beard game.Unitarian Universalists — See: atheists. We'll even take the Mormons over these guys!What's your favorite denomination? Did we miss any? Shout them at your screen now!

A gun so terrible it’s killed more people than net neutrality and Trump’s tax cuts combined. And to demonstrate how awful this weapon is I did something foolish: I tried firing one. And the experience was so horrible I have not stopped crying and soiling myself since.Yes even as I type this tears fill my eyes at the remembrance of pulling that trigger and the terrible things that followed. And my pants... my pants are so soaked.How to describe the experience of firing that monstrosity? When I pulled the trigger it was like an explosion went off INSIDE THE GUN. There was fire and everything! And then the gun ATTACKED ME! It lurched back at me trying to strike me with that flat part on the back of it. You heard me right: The gun tried to BLUDGEON ME TO DEATH!I reacted immediately and dropped to the ground curled up into a ball and started weeping — the same thing I’ve been trained to do if I ever hear the wrong pronouns used. And then I emptied my bladder and have not been able to stop since. The doctor is telling me that with all the urination and tears I could dehydrate myself; I will be yet another casualty of the terrible AR-15.Obviously any gun so scary it would make me continuously wet myself must be banned immediately. I don’t think I will be able to stop crying and peeing my pants until I am assured that no one out there owns an AR-15. This has so traumatized me that I have now nearly forgotten my previous trauma caused by a butterfly landing on my face.

Many tried to call the police to protect themselves but their cities had already defunded the police and nobody responded or else a social worker showed up to ask about their feelings.Bush has arrested thousands of Americans so far. Prisons are filling up quickly but no worries: Bush says she is holding a protest to make sure violent criminals are released as soon as possible to make room for pro-police Americans.

His evil landlord has asked him to vacate the premises since he hasn't taken care of one tiny detail in over a year: "paying rent.""If only there were some way I could go out and exchange my labor or services for money I could use to pay rent" he said sadly as he sat on a bench in the city right in front of a giant "HELP WANTED" sign. He sighed and shuffled his feet."Alas. No such system of voluntary exchange of labor and services for money exists so I have no choice but to be evicted.""Sad! Not good!"He then joined a group of protesters marching through the town demanding an eviction moratorium. The group marched past no fewer than 27 "Help Wanted" signs on their way to city hall.UPDATE: the CDC has passed an eviction moratorium so he's in the clear. Phew!

A spokesman for the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) said there’s no place for that type of vulgar language in sports today. “The United States Olympic Committee stands for pretty much the opposite of what the United States of America stands for” the spokesman said in a prepared statement. “We have enacted a strict no-patriotism policy for the Tokyo games which all athletes are required to uphold.” Ms. Mensah-Stock was already on probation with the USOC for failing to kneel during the national anthem. “Since her pro-USA comments were her second offense in as many days we had no choice but to strip her of her gold medal” the spokesman said.  Mensah-Stock’s controversial comments came in an interview immediately following her gold medal performance. “I love representing the US” she squealed. “I freaking love living there. I love it and I’m so happy I get to represent the USA!” For her part Mensah-Stock says she was caught up in the moment and didn’t realize what she was saying. “I got excited and lost my head for a minute” she said in a prepared apology as a laser dot danced around on her forehead. “As a black woman and a role model the last thing I ever wanted to do was give the impression that I’m proud to be an American.”

"While the Department of Justice has committed every resource to jailing anyone who came within a hundred yards of the Capitol that day we are equally committed to allowing small business owners to face death while their livelihoods are reduced to ashes. We were trying to protect ourselves while letting small businesses suffer and Mr. Blackburn got caught in the crossfire. We at the DOJ have to own up to our mistakes and accidentally nabbing a guy just trying to torch a jewelry store was a big one."During the hearing lawyers for Mr. Blackburn pointed out on security footage that the objects in Mr. Blackburn's hands were clearly explosives and not selfie sticks - an almost certain sign of innocence.  A man beaten senseless by Mr. Blackburn during the episode at the store came out of a coma in time to also testify on Mr. Blackburn's behalf clearly placing the defendant at Jones Family Jewelers during the Capitol riot. The presiding judge immediately tossed the case after hearing the recently comatose man's stirring testimony."Justice was done today" said Mr. Blackburn's lawyer Stan "The Rino" Bigsby. "My client was only guilty of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. I mean Congress feels threatened and suddenly now we're prosecuting people for rioting? My client has been knocking over stores for months and not a peep. How was he to know a person could get prosecuted for looting and arson? Not that he doesn't feel remorse. He has assured me that he will never loot a store that close to a gathering of politicians ever again."For his part Mr. Blackburn has stated that he 'just wants this whole thing behind him' so he can go incinerate a Wendy's in peace.

"We just want everyone to be healthy and anyone who refuses to get the vaccine should be considered less than human and be excluded from participating in society. It's the compassionate—and scientific—thing to do!"The new "separate but equal for public health" policy will take effect next week.The Mayor has also said he will be supporting increased police funding and presence in black communities to enforce vaccine segregation which will definitely not have any side effects like increased deadly police encounters and brutality."Just to be clear this is not Jim Crow. This is more like Jim Crow's nicer public health-defending cousin John Crow. This is all about safety and science because we're the government and we care" said DeBlasio.Experts say the new ordinance will actually have little effect since no one lives in New York anymore except Bill DeBlasio and Brian Stelter. Everyone else has moved to Florida.

"This is a case of having the right man for the right moment. In a culture that glorifies machismo boiling in a stew of toxic masculinity we need the voice of a hero like Andrew Cuomo to challenge men to rise to greatness. I think women everywhere are going to be touched really and truly touched by Mr. Cuomo".While some aides worried that Governor Cuomo overextended himself by agreeing to another book those aides have been fired and silenced with non-disclosure agreements. Mr. Cuomo did admit repeatedly that his hands were already full but remained absolutely adamant that he could aggressively press himself onto even more engagements if he had to.Mr. Cuomo has promised to reveal his tried and true tactics to honor women in such an incredible way that they can't even bring themselves to speak about it—unless forced to under oath. While a few details will have to be left out for legal reasons Mr. Cuomo will also describe how he and his brother worked together as wingmen to help create an environment of respect that women simply could not resist.President Biden reportedly will write the foreword where sources say he will urge Governor Cuomo to resign so as to 'leave some for the rest of us'.

"The feeling I was feeling about the feeling I was feeling was further cemented when Toby Mac came on stage and I accidentally started singing Katy Perry lyrics."According to experts the feeling of spiritual closeness to God that most people associate with worship music is pretty much the result of a really awesome bridge-to-chorus transition or flawless dynamics or a musical hook being repeated for the hundredth time before instruments drop off leaving only the drums."Oh yeah I love it so much when that happens" said Machen.Rumor has it that Presbyterians are able to worship God without any instrumental accompaniment at all but they could not be reached for comment.

Luckily we here at the Babylon Bee have made a handy how-to guide to help leftists stand up for their favorite theory.Objection: CRT shouldn't be taught to young kids.Answer: CRT is not being taught to young kids you racist!Take a page out of Joy Reid's playbook and simply say that CRT is only being taught in law schools. Since the original founding texts of CRT from the 1970s aren't being assigned to 1st graders you are totally correct.Objection: If CRT is only taught in law schools great! Then we can all agree to ban teaching it to eight-year-olds.Answer: Are you saying you don't want kids to learn about slavery you racist?!CRT is simply telling the truth about American history. This is why adults today having not had the blessing to learn CRT as kids have never heard of slavery or Jim Crow.Objection: Wait I thought you said CRT was only for law school? But if it's just teaching about the history of racism and slavery - doesn't that mean it is currently being taught to kids?Answer: Yes but kids are being taught that slavery was a good thing you racist fascist!Kids are being taught outrageous lies about slavery. Kids are hearing falsehoods such as 'slavery was good actually' and 'thousands of Americans died fighting to end slavery' and 'the Civil Rights Act was good and helped bring about the end of Jim Crow'. Nonsense!Objection: But wait those last two are facts! Shouldn't we be teaching children facts?Answer: Facts are white supremacy you racist fascist homophobe!Remind this loon that facts and objectivity are simply constructs of whiteness. We teach whatever will help us reach the political goals we want; whether it's true or not is unimportant.Objection: Your political goals seem to originate in neo-Marxism and aim to destroy the core elements of liberalism that are the foundation of our country.Answer: Fall on the ground and play dead until they walk away.Be sure to share this with every teacher you know so they'll be prepared to combat anti-CRT rhetoric at school this fall. Unless we can get school canceled again. That would be great.

In that situation the lockdown would also not be enforced and would be officially over.“For this lockdown I’m just asking you to hold out a little longer” Biden said “just until I’ve completely lost all my power and anarchists storm the White House and imprison me in the White House kitchen walk-in refrigerator. Or for one month. But no longer than that.”Though the lockdown will be over in one month or at the destruction of the United States of America many think it will still be wise to socially distance by locking oneself in a bomb shelter after that.

To combat this she has taken the unusual step of releasing all the children she had imprisoned in her gingerbread house deep within the forest.“Look at all of your children returned!” Harris announced as the kids fled from her. “And uneaten as well!”It’s unclear why Harris has such a low approval rating. Some people blame sexism or racism or a combination of the two (sometimes known as “rexism”) but Harris hopes she can turn her approval rating around by giving families back their children and not plumping them up and eating them like she had originally planned.“Run! Run back to your families!” Harris yelled to the fleeing kids and then let out one of her famous laughs.“It’s just hard for a black woman in this climate” said Sally Hubbard an aide to Harris. “And it’s not going to be any easier for her since she’ll now be cranky having not satiated her hunger for children.”

He was able to notify them en masse whenever he had a big-time speaking engagement television appearance or new ghostwritten book to sell.At publishing time archaeologists had further uncovered the sleek flatscreen TV Jesus had behind him displaying each of his sermon points as he preached.

Worth a shot!2) Launch Kamala Harris into the Sun: People really really seem to like this idea for some reason.3) Invade something: Invading another country is always good for a 10-point jump. Maybe we can invade Canada. They've always had it coming.4) Go back to his roots by hiding in a basement for another 6 months: Biden was never more popular than when he spent an entire year in a basement! And then he received a record number of votes! Who can argue with that kind of popularity?5) Launch Kamala Harris into the Sun: Wait-- did we say that one already? Huh.6) Get a spray tan and wear an orange wig: Imitating the greatest smartest most popular president of all time? Winning move!7) Send Dr. Fauci to another galaxy so he can spread his pandemic wisdom with other planets: Or if that's too hard maybe just the Sun again.8) Fire everyone he's ever appointed and shut down all Federal agencies: This one's a no-brainer and we're not sure what Biden's waiting for here. Come on man! This is no joke!NOT SATIRE: President Biden nominated someone with a history of eco-terrorism to run the Bureau of Land Management which controls nearly a tenth of American lands and Senate Democrats stand ready to confirm her. Tracy Stone-Manning was part of a tree spiking operation where terrorists drove metal spikes into a forest that was about to be cut down making it so that loggers could be seriously hurt or even killed if their saws hit one of the spikes.It sounds like satire but it isn’t. Sen. Joe Manchin seems like the Democrat most likely to see reason on this issue. With just a few clicks you can send him a message or give his office a quick call telling him to vote NO on Tracy Stone-Manning’s confirmation.

"We had a bit of a kerfuffle with your goalie for sure so we're soory aboot that. And then we destroyed you 1-0!

This is what you get minions!" roared the Mayor. "Fifty Power Stars - I mean COVID cases! Fifty cases and I get to take your precious freedoms. You thought you had beaten me but my Koopas arrived from Texas with twelve Power Stars - I mean cases - and now victory is mine! Gwa-ha-ha!!!"Journalists attempted to ask Mayor Bowser about why she violated her own rule the previous evening but the Mayor destroyed them with a fireball before she escaped through a warp pipe. The Mayor then teleported back to her office where she signed an order banning fireballs and warp pipes.While some of the Koopas have turned out to be relatively harmless others have taken to hurling hammers and bombs at citizens who fail to comply. Several Koopa Paratroopa squadrons have already arrived in D.C. and begun to deal out their unusual brand of justice. Citizens have however noted that the Mayor's shock troops are extremely predictable in their movements and can generally be avoided with a little planning.Pockets of resistance have been especially heavy in D.C.'s Italian neighborhoods where reports have surfaced of people jumping on the backs of the Mayor's troops putting several in a completely catatonic state. The Mayor has responded with targeted lockdowns and the construction of several elaborate mazes making escape from the neighborhoods difficult. Even the most talented residents are needing about 2 hours to successfully elude the Koopas and make it downtown to the Mayor's dungeon/office.Sources on the ground say two plumbers claimed to have visited the Mayor's office and convinced her to abdicate her position and install one of them Mayor instead. However it turns out they were both tripping really really hard on shrooms.

Instead every birth certificate will only include the simple phrase "you were born.""Assigning sex using binary variables in the public portion of the birth certificate fails to recognize the medical spectrum of gender identity" said Whiro while chomping on the tasty souls of the damned. "We must remove all distinctions that could lead to discrimination or the denial of people's right to define their own reality and become their own gods. Um... and also their right to be damned so I can eat their souls."California will be the first state to implement the AMA's new recommendations. They will remove date of birth so that children can identify as whatever age they want and sex—so that kids can identify as whatever gender they want. Place of birth as well as words like "father" and "mother" will also be removed. This is expected to have no adverse side effects whatsoever.After some public outcry from Black Lives Matter California agreed to keep "race" on the certificates since that is the most important thing about you.

Expand the Transportation Safety Administration from 50000 employees to fifty million employees. This will allow for 100% virus screening at all public and private indoor spaces carried out with the efficiency and professionalism that we’ve all come to expect from the TSA.2. Enhanced use of domestic drone surveillance for contact tracing purposes as well as the repurposing of drone-mounted munitions to drop vaccines instead of explosives.3. Expansion of the prison facility at Guantanamo Bay to hold our most dangerous political prisoners such as folks who participated in the January 6 Capitol riot or those who share misinformation on Facebook.“With these initiatives in place we believe we will quickly crush the virus and establish the first Galactic Empire for a safe and secure society!" Psaki said.

I literally thought I was going to die."When asked why he had politely held the door open for everyone to enter the building unimpeded he replied that he feared for his life and that one of the larger rioters had come up to him and said "step aside cupcake" in an intimidating voice."I knew my only option was to step aside or be drawn and quartered by a throng of evil bad people who voted for Trump and are also racist" he said as tears welled up in his eyes.Officer Burbo has been awarded a medal of bravery since even though he opened the door for rioters he really didn't want to do it and his heart was in the right place.The FBI has issued a warrant for the man who called Officer Burbo a "cupcake" and is asking anyone with information to call Nancy Pelosi's office immediately.

"As it turns out there's really no agreed-upon criteria for what qualifies someone to be an expert. As a result we have a ton of self-proclaimed 'experts' who don't know what they're talking about.

While the exact effectiveness of face masks in preventing the spread of COVID-19 isn’t known a new study has shown that face masks are highly ineffective in protecting you from looking like some giant dummy who doesn’t know how viruses or vaccines work.“When you wear a mask” said researcher Norman Ryan who specializes in things that make you look dumb “people will often ask ‘Are you vaccinated?’ And if you answer yes to that they’ll follow up with ‘Don’t you know what a vaccine does?’ and then stare at you like you’re an idiot. In control groups without masks this didn’t happen.”Ryan also found that the amount the mask makes you look dumb varies based on the conditions in which it’s used. For example it makes you look the least stupid in a crowded indoor environment and very stupid while outdoors and deadly stupid if worn while driving alone in a car. “We’re seeing long-term permanent effects from wearing a mask alone in a car” Ryan added. “People who see you doing that will never respect you ever again.”The CDC though seems unconcerned about making people look stupid. “We don’t actually care about anyone” said CDC spokesman Jerome Barber. “We just like throwing out arbitrary rules and feeling important. We’re as surprised as anyone that people listen to us at all.”

"I’m not talking about our immune systems. I’m talking about our friends families and neighbors who helped us through this difficult ordeal. They are the TRUE cure for the pandemic.” “Over the last 17 months we’ve laughed together virtually cried together virtually and even burned down several city blocks in the name of peaceful protests” he said. “If we keep working together while wearing masks and staying six feet apart there’s no end to what we can accomplish.” “Though we’ve made great progress we’re not out of the woods just yet” the spokesman then warned. “So please continue to harass your friends and neighbors about wearing masks report improper behavior to government authorities and out strangers on social media whenever possible. That’s what good friends do.”  The spokesman concluded the press conference by urging everyone to get a third Pfizer shot preferably prior to the end of the company’s fiscal third quarter on September 30. He said the firm is also testing the need for a fourth booster shot the need for which will depend highly on how the rest of their fiscal year goes.

Response to the trailer has been cautious after the disastrous previous attempt to reboot the franchise in 2016. Sony Pictures vows this movie will be different though primarily because they’re not letting any women act in it.“We’re not exactly sure why the 2016 reboot failed” said Sony Pictures spokesman Jeffrey Floyd “but they did switch the cast to all women in that one. So just to be safe we’re not having any women at all in this one. All of the crew members also had to be men. No women were anywhere near this one.”Some say this may be an overcorrection. For example when Sigourney Weaver star of the first two Ghostbusters films asked to have a cameo the studio informed her that her part had been recast to be played by Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson. Regardless of the criticism Sony Pictures is holding firm.“If we learned anything from the 2016 reboot it’s that people only want to watch men bust ghosts” said Floyd. “We have to be careful with these venerated franchises to make sure we give fans what they want. If that means tacking up a ‘No Girls Allowed’ sign so be it.”

You may also have a problem with this because you aren't wise in the ways of science like we are. It's ok-- we're here to help.Here are eight reasons masking is a must.1) Kids aren't real people and they don't have any feelings: Kids are pretty much just noise and snot factories. They won't even remember this time in their lives so you're definitely not traumatizing them or anything.2) Kids try to manipulate you with their cute little faces: Take control by covering those faces up!3) It's never too early to teach complete unquestioning loyalty to the government: It's the most important virtue.4) Breathing in CO2 all day will make them more complacent and easier to indoctrinate: That's when you can fill their brains with race and gender theory!5) As white kids struggle to breathe you can remind them that every breath of oxygen they take could have been taken by a student of color: You can then remind the students of color that the white kids are stealing all their oxygen.6) Masks muffle kids' annoying voices: Kids are always asking questions like "why are you making us wear masks?" in their little annoying voice. Muffle that noise and give yourself some peace and quiet.7) Since your students are already conveniently masked you can take them to participate in the local Antifa rally:  Burning businesses is the best way for students to learn about peaceful civic action.8) Masks will help everyone look more gender-neutral: This will help students embrace their true identity without biological identity getting in the way.Just put on the mask and don't ask any more questions.

This special edition of the Bible has over 30000 notes all of which just say "Go ask your husband to explain this to you."Scholars who worked on the study Bible say they did extensive research over many years to distill down this excellent knowledge for all women who want to know more about the Bible and live out God's will for their lives. They did deep-dive word studies and examined thousands of sources to come to the best most accurate meaning for each verse then just put a note in there saying the woman should ask her husband to explain the verse to her."This is the perfect tool for the woman wanting to dig deeper into the Word of God" said Zondervan spokesperson Ian O'Poole. "If you have a question about any verse in the Bible you just follow the little number—written in pink so even you won't miss it—and go check to see what the note says. Then you go ask your husband preferably not during the church service when it's disruptive but when you're back at home and he will husbandsplain to you what the Bible actually means.""If you're not married yet well you'd better get married quick so you too can understand the Bible!"

"But watch out! You'll face angry primitive natives like Antifa and Black Lives Matter!"The game has players load up their station wagons with supplies like avocado toast vape pens craft beers and other Portland staples and try to drive a few miles across town without getting mobbed by a group of protesters. Clever players will choose to outfit their wagons with Bernie stickers and Coexist decals to try to ward off the natives. To feed their caravan of travelers players will have to make daring stops at communist-owned coffee shops and risk going to taco stands in extra-deadly autonomous zones.You can even play minigames where you befriend the locals and help them tip over some statues.One "rookie mistake" is to dress your character in a MAGA hat since that's an "almost certain" way to die of peaceful protests according to the game's developers.You can of course still die of dysentery.

They won't be able to run too well but really—winning isn't everything. Godliness is everything."Pastor John MacArthur of Grace to You ministries has endorsed the uniform saying he may even watch the Olympics in four years if the women are wearing jean dresses.Olympic authorities loudly objected to the proposal saying the uniforms are not nearly sexy enough and may detract from their perverse enjoyment of watching barely clothed women compete in athletic games. Their statement was cut short however when the earth swallowed them up and dragged them straight to the depths of Hades.The Olympic committee has outsourced the uniform decision to a team of local deacons who are expected to come up with a decision within a decade or so.

Hatlessness. Men don't wear hats anymore. But what’s my number two complaint?That’s right: Everyone is a bunch of sissies.With this pandemic it’s been sissy Christmas every day. Everyone is all “Ooh! The virus is out there and going to get me! I’m going to hide in my house and wear my mask! Please inject me with stuff and tell me it will protect me!” It’s pathetic. No wonder nowadays people are confused about who women are since everyone sounds like one.It wasn’t like that back in the long long ago — the good old days — when men were men women were women and you weren’t allowed to switch. Back then we weren’t scared of any little old disease. And guess how we fared?Well yes a lot of us died. Medicine was not quite as good back then. A lot less medical debt a lot more dying. It’s a tradeoff. But we weren’t as whiny about it. And man we had some diseases. Smallpox. Polio. Spanish Flu (and I know they say that name is offensive now but that was our PC term for it; if you heard what we actually called it it would blow your little tolerant minds). Those things they’d kill you. But we didn’t care. We just lived our lives... well some of us. Others dropped dead. We had a lot more funerals back then but those are good social gatherings to meet and talk to each other as we didn’t have Twitbook and Facer. So it all worked out.And because we stood up to disease and death we built this country into something great with nuclear power and moon landings. You people can’t do that these days because you’re all hiding in your houses waiting for things to fall back to the stone age.So that’s why you need to be like your ancestors and get out there and say “I ain’t scared of you disease! I ain’t even believe in germs and viruses; I’ve never seen them and scientists could have just made those up!” And then get on with your life. What’s the worst that could happen? Well yeah you could die... but nothing worse than that.

Some are even saying it's the most important strategy developed in soccer since the kick was invented. Many are hopeful it will even get Americans interested in watching soccer again."It's a genius strategy" said one commentator as a singer on the sidelines began singing "O say can you see by the dawn's early light" over the stadium's sound system. Megan Rapinoe was going to intercept a pass but dutifully took a knee and was forced to turn over the ball to the other team or however it is that soccer works. "Beautiful play there! It's going to be tough to see the U.S. women recover from this one!""Oooh and now the singer is going hard into the 'home of the brave' stanza really forcing the U.S. women to stay kneeling. "Wicked brilliant!" (We are told "wicked brilliant" means "cool" or "dope" in British.)At the end of their first match in which the opposing team employed this tactic the women lost 27-1 having scored one goal when Rapinoe stood up briefly when the singer ran out of breath.

Many of the adherents seem to stick to old backward ways of thinking. They tend to be judgmental and look at things as “good” and “evil” based on their outdated views. A new progressive Christian has arrived on the scene though who preaches a more open modern Christianity that’s less judgmental and takes people as they are.“I’m not here to change you or condemn you based on some interpretation of words that are thousands of years old” said the charming progressive Christian. “You are special and God loves you as you are.”This new Christian has attracted many followers with his people-positive message. “Other Christians preach a narrower view of things” said the progressive Christian. “But there are many different paths to God. Everyone is probably already on one and just needs a little push.”UPDATE: It turns out that he was not a Christian at all but just Satan... again.“Yeah almost had you this time” said Satan. “I just keep packaging up sin and self-worship as a virtue but people like that you know.”Satan says despite being discovered he’s going to keep at it. “I just have better marketing.

The guilty ones I mean.”Clintock has promised to leave no stone unturned to get to the truth. “Already we have rioters being held and interrogated at an undisclosed location. They are being kept for their own safety until we can find out how Trump made them do this.”Hilliard Clintock says he hopes to make quick work of this investigation so he can get back to investigating the stolen 2016 election.

They said that significant budget cutbacks were necessary since they can no longer sell tickets to events.“We’ve had to cut costs everywhere we can” the spokesman said. “The athletes are sleeping on beds made of cardboard the shotputs are actually old bowling balls and we’ve had to shave down the women’s medals to pay for COVID testing.” “Ultimately it’s barely noticeable” he added. “The ladies are much smaller than the male competitors so the medals look the same size when worn by a smaller person. It’s a win-win for everyone!” Responding to a media question the spokesman also confirmed that any transgender female athletes who win their events will receive one of the larger men’s-size medals. “They have such broad chests and huge muscles we really don’t think it’s fair to stick them with one of the smaller medals” he said. “That would look ridiculous.”

This freedom is so virulent that people infected by it feel they can ignore government edicts about masks and lockdowns.“Usually the freedom we see in the wild is fairly mild” explained CDC official Hubert Pratt. “It’s just freedom to passionately express one of the approved viewpoints on social media or freedom to pick one of the three Obamacare options. But now we see people acting like politicians aren’t in charge of them at all and it’s dangerous.”With the new freedom variant there’s been an outbreak of people not wearing masks teaching their children their own values and expressing ideas the Biden Administration would rather they not. Moreover this freedom is highly contagious even sometimes breaking into blue states once thought to be immune.Experts recommend only staying on highly moderated social media sites and watching approved network news to avoid being infected. They also tell people to watch out for the signs of this dangerous freedom variant in others: masklessness smiling and prominent displays of the American flag.

At first Thanos was hesitant on the idea as he thought killing half of all life to be an extreme solution and instead planned to stick to his environmental work. Still after months of coaxing Thanos agreed to hunt down the Infinity Stones.“We needed him to have at least some of the Infinity Stones so we could prosecute him” said Holloway. “So we worked with the Nova Corps to make sure he got the purple Power Stone and gave Thanos the location of the other stones we knew of. We figured we’d grab him once he had three. Unfortunately he got the five other stones a little faster than we were expecting.”Thanos obtained all six Infinity Stones and then proceeded to kill half the life in the universe. “So it worked basically” said Holloway. “I mean we have him dead to rights now; he’ll be easy to prosecute. He’s also infinitely powerful though. So partial success.”

Now tragedy has struck her with what she sees as a clear failure of that economic system: She has accidentally super-glued her face to her coffee table.“See what capitalism has done to me?!” Ocasio-Cortez told the press who had to meet her in her living room since she couldn’t leave because a coffee table was glued to her head. “I had broken apart a vase I bought to see if there was a prize inside — there wasn’t — and then I was trying to glue it back together. So I emptied a whole tube of Krazy Glue to prepare but then I thought I heard my coffee table talking to me — like maybe I got superpowers where I’m able to understand the secret language of furniture as I did get electrocuted by my toaster recently and that sort of thing can give you superpowers. So I put my ear to the coffee table but then I got stuck because of all the glue. And the coffee table wasn’t even talking — I had just dropped my phone underneath it. Capitalism has gotten me once again!”Ocasio-Cortez then described how this was all because of capitalism which drove her to buy a glue made way too strong a vase with no secret prize in it and a phone that she was constantly playing YouTube videos on and dropping. And now all those things conspired together to get her face stuck to her furniture.Critics though have said that Ocasio-Cortez actually likes capitalism as demonstrated by her online store of which she’s proud. “That’s not capitalism” Ocasio-Cortez explained. “That’s just me meeting consumers’ wants by providing merchandise at prices they’ll pay.

"This isn't the time to score goals—when America is still racist. We totally could have beaten Sweden but we decided as a team that no goals will be scored until complete equality has been achieved in America. Also we demand a hefty raise."Onlookers were stunned during the second half of the game when Rapinoe dribbled the ball all the way to Sweden's unprotected goal and whispered "This is for you people of color" before kicking the ball straight into the air and running headfirst into the goalpost."This may be one of the most powerful performances in the history of sports" said Teen Vogue's sportswriter who has never watched sports.The U.S. Women's team is demanding to remain in the Olympic tournament and promises to continue its streak of zero goals.

Unfortunately many Christians believe they’re supposed to put all their treasure in Heaven which simply is not smart investing. Pastor Joel Osteen though is promoting a stronger portfolio.“Treasure in Heaven is pretty good because there rust and moths can’t get it and thieves can’t steal it” Osteen said. “But there’s a big disadvantage to that treasure: You can’t exchange it for a Ferrari or a mansion—not an earthly one at least like I got and it is glorious.”Osteen wants Christians to remember that eternity is a while away (hopefully) and you can’t just put all your eggs in that basket. “You have to live your best life now and that means you need your treasures closer—nothing's more illiquid than a mutual fund. If you put your treasures in Heaven that’s even harder to get into than a 401(k).”Osteen also reminded people of the Bible verse “Where your treasure is there your heart will be also.”“I like to keep my heart near my 17000 square foot mansion and my V12 engine because those are awesome” Osteen said.

Many thought CNN would not recover from the post-Trump years but it appears people will actually pay not to have to ever see CNN again."We're giving the people what they want" said Brian Stelter. "And what they want apparently is to see a whole lot less of me."Subscribers will never again have to see a CNN broadcast whether they're at the airport a hotel lobby or they accidentally surf on by the channel while trying to turn into a real news station. Advanced streaming technology allows CNN+ to detect when a subscriber is in the vicinity of a public television playing CNN and the system will automatically block all programming from view.People who subscribe to the higher tiers of the subscription platform will get additional perks like three throws at Brian Stelter perched above a dunk tank. Oh and it's filled with alligators!

Yeah you pastor! Is your church boring? Is your congregation leaving in droves to go to the cool church down the street that has hot worship leaders and laser lights?You gotta fix that. Here's how to make sure your bored congregants come back next Sunday.1) Offer VIP backstage passes to meet the pastor: As the pastor you are a celebrity and everyone wants to meet you. Offer exclusive VIP passes to the first 20 people!2) Challenge the pastor of the church across the street to a cage fight: Bible teaching is fine but what people really want is bloody pay-per-view MMA fighting! The winner of the match gets to keep half of the other church's members.3) Offer anyone who shows up a chance to play bass in the worship band: Make dreams come true. Don't worry you don't have to tell them the bass is always unplugged anyway.4) Replace boring wafer communion with Cinnabon cinnamon rolls: Irresistible.5) Everyone gets a Taboo buzzer to press whenever the pastor says something they don't like: Nothing like some audience participation! If you're low on funds you can give them rotten cabbage to throw.6) Tie a string to their smartphone and slowly pull it toward the church doors: Virtually everyone on earth is emotionally and physically dependant on their smartphones. Isn't it time they were emotionally and physically dependant on walking through your church doors every Sunday?7) Put CBD vape capsules in the fog machine to help everyone stay relaxed: Maybe add some nicotine for a little chemical dependence.8) Advertise a new "forgive any sin" promotion: We all know God can forgive any sin (except the sin of voting Democrat) but it feels so much better if it's part of a cool promotion! Print out coupons for extra interest.NOT SATIRE: You don't need a shopping mall building with a food court to grow your church!

"But you know science and what-not.

There are several reasons for this. Facebook. FOX News. Climate change maybe. Despite this we have to convince the people who aren’t vaccinated to get the shot. So how do you convince someone to go against a deeply held belief? It’s hard to say but I know how I want to convince someone: screaming at them how dumb they are until they change their ways. Thus I’ve decided that’s the best way to persuade people.If we are to save everyone from this pandemic we have to find all the people who aren’t vaccinated and scream at them as loudly and as angrily as we can. Remember: The louder and angrier you are the more right you sound and the more likely you are to convince people.And that means you also can’t show any doubt. I don’t care if all your knowledge comes from some article you only half-read or something that just popped into your head and seems right to you; you shout that with absolute religious certainty.“COVID is spreading worse than ever!”“The delta variant is twenty times as deadly!”“If you don’t get vaccinated today five hundred million kids will die tomorrow!”And here’s the essential part: Make sure the people you are screaming at know that you hate them. If there is one thing that can convince people to change their ways it’s that they don’t want to be hated by angry people ignorantly screaming at them. They want to be friends with those people.So get out there scream at the unvaccinated and maybe together we can convince them all. And even if we don’t at least we got to scream at people we hate.

He was particularly impressed with how the Biden White House doesn't even have to censor information themselves but can simply flag posts as problematic and private companies will jump to take care of dissenters automatically. Even President Xi usually has to "lift a finger" to censor someone so he's pretty jealous of the way the U.S. is handling censorship of "misinformation.""Honestly I'm impressed and a little jealous" said China's dictator after he heard Press Secretary Jen Psaki say the White House flags posts for Facebook to remove and that someone who gets banned on one social network should get banned on all of them. "And I thought I had absolute control over the speech of my people! This is next-level stuff. Really quite something.""And having a private company do it so the people can't complain about freedom of speech - brilliant. My hat is off to the United States."At publishing time President Xi had phoned Biden on his special "red phone" that lets him speak directly to his friend Joe to get more tips on how to rule his people with an iron fist.

Democrats are whining that this makes voting “too hard” and “scary.”“What if the minotaur charges?” asked disgusting beta male Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. “And what if you get lost in the labyrinth? It’s so dark in there! This all sounds way too difficult snarf snarf.”Republicans pointed out though that voting will still be accessible to all as the labyrinth will have wheelchair ramps. Also you don’t have to fight the minotaur to prove you’re not trying to commit voter fraud — you can instead just answer its riddle (after showing proper photo ID). And the riddle will also be available in Spanish. In addition the polling place will be open for fifteen days of early voting — which the Republicans do recommend everyone use since it takes on average three days to get through the labyrinth.“There’s an old Texas saying my pappy used to tell me” said Texas Governor Greg “Tex” Abbott a proponent of the change. “‘If you can’t fight a minotaur then yer probably trying to vote fraudulently.’ Yeehaw!”Still Democrats are calling this “voter suppression” because they always have to complain about something. So they’re probably going to cry a lot and write hashtags instead of just manning up and training to use a broadsword for Election Day.

The latest numbers show the prevalence of the virus has doubled this week from a total of two cases to four. “The data keeps coming in and it doesn’t look good” said Dr. Anthony Fauci. “We’re seeing a 100% increase in cases! That’s double two-fold 2x twice as many! I don’t want to sound alarmist but it's very likely we'll all be dead by Labor Day.”Fauci said the increasing numbers seem to be the result of pandemic fatigue causing people to let down their guard and engage in risky behaviors like leaving the house or breathing. He urged Americans to remain vigilant in order to end the pandemic as soon as possible. “Getting vaccinated is the key to getting back to normal” Fauci pleaded with the nation. “All we need you to do is go and get yourself vaccinated. Well that and social distance quit your job reduce your carbon footprint wear three masks vote Democrat and sacrifice your firstborn child to Molech in the hopes that he shows mercy upon you. Why is that so hard for everyone?” In related news officials in Canada say they are dealing with an apocalyptic surge of "literally infinity percent" after COVID cases increased from zero to one this week. “Our nation may never recover from this” said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

But as each new day people breathlessly inform us of the racist history of things like crossword puzzles and punctuality scientists are warning of an impending catastrophe.“At this current rate of coming up with new things that are racist” warned racism scientist Frank Greene “we’ll run out of new things to call racist by the end of this year.”Anti-racism activists met this news with both fear and denial. “Running out of new things to call racist would be devastating” said activist Brooke Snyder. “I mean you’ll only get attention if you come up with something no one knows is racist. You can’t just say things like ‘Ethnic slurs are racist.’ Everyone knows that.”Benny Malone though is one of those skeptical of the warning from scientists. “We’ll always be able to find new things that are racist” he said. “Just watch me.” He thought for a few moments. “Ah. I got a new one: Toothpaste is racist.” His face then fell. “Wait I have explained how that’s racist already. Well anyway we can’t listen to science because I know for certain we’ve all told everyone that science is racist.”Some proposed solutions to the impending problem include giving activists stringent limits on how many things per month they can declare racist but this has proven unpopular. Another idea is to instead come up with new things each day to call sexist but no one cares about that as much.

Man it feels great to be on the right side of history.”“While the 3 Branches have worked for centuries it was time for an upgrade” explained Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. “Big Tech may be the youngest branch by far but it’s definitely still the most 'on the right side of history' of all the branches!”“All we do is give someone at Facebook Google or Apple a list of names and then it’s their job to coerce intimidate and even destroy that person’s livelihood until they are compliant” AOC continued. “Basically anything we don’t like or that goes against the party’s messaging at that time is dealt with by the Big Techutive branch.”“And this way elected officials don’t take the blame. It goes to unelected employees of the world’s largest most powerful corporations. So even if the backlash was strong enough we can simply replace them with another of our own.”At publishing time Democrats Big Tech and most lizard people all agreed that this new branch of government was a step in the right direction that would in no way eliminate free speech or cheapen our democracy.

"There are many problematic people in this country who desperately need re-education and we can think of no one better to run the camps than the most powerful social media platform in history!

"The government is not violating the 1st Amendment by outsourcing the gulags to Facebook since Facebook is a private entity—and their terms of service clearly state at the bottom of page 3272 that they are allowed to detain you in a labor camp any time they want to. If you agreed to the terms of service there's really nothing you can do. I guess you should have used another monopolistic social media platform. This is a huge win for conservative free-speech principles."In a statement Facebook said they remain committed to gently re-educating purveyors of vaccine and 2020 election misinformation until they have all the correct opinions on everything.Conservative politicians said they will not take this lying down and have promised to haul Mark Zuckerberg before a committee and yell at him a little bit.

The ones who are being kidnapped killed tortured and starved to death by the communists? Not so much.

Some of them are even worse than the Civil War. Just ask Joe Biden. Over his short presidency he has already compared all ten of these things to the Civil War:1. Republicans asking people to show ID at the polls - Literally just as bad as Gettysburg.2. The Jan. 6 attack on the capitol where millions died - Literally just as bad as Antietam.3. His favorite ice cream shop being out of chocolate chocolate chip - Biden freaked out over this one calling it "the worst attack on democracy since Lincoln was shot by Lee Harvey Oswald."4. Matlock getting canceled - Hoo boy was he furious about this.5. That one time a reporter asked him an actual question - The one time this happened in all of human history he said it was "just like that Gettysburg thing."6. "You know the thing!" - We aren't sure what he was talking about here but it was definitely worse than the Civil War.7. Taco Bell discontinuing the Caramel Apple Empanada - OK he's got a point here.8. Catholic priests denying him Communion for not believing Catholic things - A true outrage and definitely worse than the ACW.9. When the world was destroyed in World War 3 back in February 2020 - You probably don't even remember this war between us and Iran. Because you're dead.10. The New York Post reporting on his son's laptop - Pickett's Charge has nothing on this national tragedy.Is Joe right about these?

Good News: They're Teaching It About As Well As They Teach Math",U.S.—There is really bad news for parents who are sending their kids to government schools: many teachers are in fact teaching critical race theory to kids telling them that everything must be analyzed through the lens of race and oppression. This is not good. Children may begin to exhibit signs of racism as they start to think that skin color is the most important thing about them and every other kid they meet. Many are concerned that there is going to be a resurgence of racial tensions since teachers are pushing these ideas on students going to these schools.But there is also some good news: the teachers are teaching CRT just about as well as they teach math meaning the CRT instruction may be having the opposite effect on kids. Just as many public school students struggle to figure out what 2+2 is since U.S. schools lag behind government schools in other countries students aren't quite grasping the tenets of critical race theory since the teachers are doing their usual awful job. After teachers began pushing the racist regressive ideas on their students they actually started to know even less about it than before thanks to the public school teachers doing a really bad job at teaching.Well that's a relief!

While Biden usually welcomes anyone — especially illegal immigrants — to America the Cubans are different because when they come here they might commit malicious acts such as voting Republican. Thus Biden is trying to dissuade Cubans from coming here by telling them that if they’re fleeing to America to seek freedom America is actually getting rid of that.“I’m sorry but we’re junking that right-wing QAnon liberty malarkey” Biden said in a statement aimed at Cuba. “If you want that look elsewhere. We found that freedom got in the way of responding to COVID — which we’re pretty certain is never ever going away — and all of our economic plans so it’s on its way out Jack.”Biden also pointed out that it is dumb to flee the Marxism in Cuba because we're trying to get more Marxism here. “All the young people on my staff they can’t get enough of the Marxism” Biden said. “So if you don’t like that it’s just a terrible idea to come over here. Maybe instead try... I dunno... is Guam a country?”Biden did extend an invite to any refugees though who are fleeing their countries because they don’t provide enough education about Critical Race Theory.

That is of course not the case anymore as all of communism’s critics have seemingly vanished overnight.“Well it must not have been so bad after all” shrugged President Miguel Díaz-Canel. “They must have all changed their minds realized how wonderful Cuba is and gone to tell their families to return to Cuba.”“How could this have happened though? They had so many passionate protestors condemning the conditions under communism and demanding real change!” asked local journalist Alonzo Amada. “I mean um the only logical conclusion is that they all must have realized they were mistaken and that the food prices housing costs and healthcare lines are actually perfect.”“Probably won’t be hearing from them again.” added the President of Cuba. “Once people are shown how great everything is and that there is not a single thing bad they become so content they never speak out again!”At publishing time Alonzo Amada was heading to interview an outspoken critic of Cuba’s current state but then he remembered suddenly that he had to head home.  Alonzo said that he needed to water his goldfish and this has nothing to do with the suspicious van following him.

This is leading other governors across the country to ask Texas for advice on how they can get Democrats to leave their states as well."Arizona is a beautiful state" said Governor Doug Ducey "but it has one problem: it's full of Democrats. Is there some way we can just get them to—I dunno—leave? Why can't they live in California or Cuba or somewhere they'll fit in better?"The governor of Georgia has also stated he will be flying to Texas to learn all of Governor Abbott's secrets to making Democrats go somewhere else."We hope to follow the great example set by Texas" said Georgia Governor Brian Kemp. "Democrats have this nasty habit of destroying their states like a plague of locusts turning it into a burnt husk of death and decay and then moving to another Republican state to feast on the prosperity built by higher quality people than they'll ever be then importing their depraved and inhuman policies as they consume all the wealth and happiness of the state like some sort of demonic chupacabra until they finally bring a once-great American state to its knees drowning in a cesspool of poverty and corruption at which point they spread their locust wings and fly to the next state... what was I talking about? I can't remember. Oh yeah—how do we get Democrats to leave?"At the time of publishing 32 other states have announced comprehensive "make the Democrat politicians go somewhere else" plans which they hope to have fully implemented by the end of this year.According to reports Texas is now a blissful and prosperous utopia only 12 hours after Democrat lawmakers left in their private charter plane.

He took the time to lecture the man who had escaped socialism on a raft when he was young on why socialism is actually good and how he knows a lot more about socialism than people from socialist countries."Greetings!" Pollyton said. "I'm Eddard he/him. I see from your skin color—which is the most important thing about you—that you are Cuban. Pretty sad how those Cubans aren't appreciating the great social programs they have right now am I right?"The man stared dumbfounded as the student went on and on about private ownership of the means of production the plight of the proletariat and the need for the workers to unite and work for the common good. He explained to the man who had nearly starved to death as a child and only survived because his parents had put him on a raft and dared a dangerous sea voyage across the Gulf of Mexico that Cubans have some of the best healthcare free food and medicine and literacy programs in the world.Finally the man had heard enough. "Get out of here. You young people have no idea what socialism is like man.""Wait a minute—did you just assume my gender?"

"There is a real danger of kids being turned off to Communism due to the annoying fact that it's a godless and inhuman ideology that fails in spectacular fashion resulting in death or starvation literally every time it's implemented. It's really not fair. It may lead to people thinking Communism is bad even though we know it's really good when implemented correctly."Historians say that the gulags in the U.S.S.R. torture in North Korea concentration camps in China starvation in Venezuela and people desperately escaping Cuba could serve to make people incorrectly think Communism is a less than stellar way of organizing society.Studies have indeed confirmed a slight drop in support for Communism in light of Cuban Communism's spectacularly disastrous failure on the world stage as Cuban citizens call for freedom. According to surveys support for Communism among Millennial and Gen Z voters dropped from 78% to 77%."If this keeps up support for Communism may continue to erode" warned a visibly worried Smirnoff. "It's important to convince the next generation that Communism works even though it always fails. Maybe teach CRT or something."

Are you confused? You probably are. Whiteness has that effect on people. We're here to help.So how can you know your kids are being taught CRT in school? Here are the 7 signs:1) They call your boss to tell how racist you are: If your kid tries to get you canceled because you perpetuate systems of oppressive whiteness by treating all races equally--which is totally racist-- they might be learning CRT.2) They segregate all their stuffed animals by fur color: Kids who have been taught CRT know the value of creating segregated decolonized spaces for their stuffies of color to play without white harassment.3) They come home with purple hair and a 'Kill All Men' tattoo: This look is the standard issue for kids who believe all the tenets of CRT.4) They try to get out of math homework by telling you math is racist: Well it is. So why are you making them do it you racist boomer?5) They refuse to eat on Taco Tuesday due to cultural appropriation: Literally every white ally of social justice knows that enjoying any aspect of another culture that doesn't belong to your own is racist. Segregate those cultures Mom and Dad!6) They ask all their minority classmates to bully them: Are they white? Then they deserve it!7) They explain over dinner how Marxist ideology is a potent and effective tool for infiltrating all aspects of modern civilization-- including culture religion economy and government-- in order to dismantle the established order and topple the bourgeois: Wow! so true!If your kid exhibits any of these signs they're on their way!

The rural Americans had never seen such a device though and soon became angry at it.“It’s stealing our documents’ souls!” exclaimed one simple rural American upon seeing his ID copied. He then pointed an accusing finger at Harris. “She must be a witch!”“I am not a witch” Harris stated though her statement was undercut by the way she kept cackling like one.The angry rural folk then tied Harris to a stake to burn her as a witch.“It was not my idea to impose advanced city technology on your simple rural brains!” Harris pleaded with them. “That is the fault of the Republicans! I wanted to spare you from this!”The rural people ignored her and began lighting kindling around her feet.“Science forgive them!” Harris called out. “They know not what they do!

"Laura said I'd never find it in this mess but she misunderestimated me once again. They said we couldn't beat Afghanistan but boy howdy our boys finally showed them evildoers who's boss!"President Biden was reportedly very touched by the kind gesture. He broached the idea of attempting to land a plane on an aircraft carrier as Bush did but aides nixed the idea as they don't think Kamala Harris could defeat a turnip in an election.Instead President Biden will land his go-kart in the disabled parking spot at the local ice cream parlor which will proudly display the banner. A perfectly intersectional representation of the military will be on hand for the celebration as well as a selection of Biden's favorite drones."Never get involved in a land war in Asia that's what my pop always told me" said President Biden addressing the crowd of journalists. "They said it just couldn't be won!

"We here at ESPN are committed to preaching the gospel of Disney and occasionally explaining why sports are evil. Nothing we do should have any entertainment value whatsoever and I deeply apologize for my behavior."Stephen A. Smith covered the issue on his show by starting off speaking very deliberately and quietly then steadily building to a screeching yell.

Teachers have responded by demanding cameras be placed in homes so they can monitor what parents are teaching their students.“Why shouldn’t we be able to see what they are teaching our students? Do they have something to hide?” said Katherine Lunsford a public school teacher and activist. “For all we know they could be teaching our students that America is a great country or worse that not seeing race is okay.”“We need dedicated cameras in every room to watch students at all times to ensure they are being educated with state-approved worldviews” Katherine continued. “We can’t just sit back and let these parents undo all of our hard work.”Advocates of cameras in every home argue that a concerning number of parents are not adequately continuing the children’s education at home. They claim that kids return from summer break knowing nothing about climate justice minority queer theory or the racist roots of math.“I just want my kids to learn the normal subjects and to treat everyone with respect regardless of race” said local parent Paul Collins an extremist bigot who pulled his kids out of public school to indoctrinate them. “CRT in public schools told my kids they were horrible white oppressors! And now they are telling me that I can’t homeschool my kids unless they record everything that goes on in our home!”At publishing time parents who refused to accept cameras in their homes were labeled enemies of the state and their children were placed in the care of Child Protective Services.

Tolkien raised Anduril aloft and the army submitted to the professor allowing him to lead them into battle against everyone trying to deconstruct his book and make it woke.From writers pushing "queer readings" of his epic heavily Catholic and decidedly traditionalist and non-woke magnum opus to movie studio executives looking for ways to put nudity into their film and show adaptations thousands fell in battle against the army.

As always the president has sole authority to launch nuclear weapons. President Biden requested that he be given a button that he wears at all times for that. The problem is that the White House also has several Life Alert buttons to alert people when Biden's fallen or had another old person-type calamity and those buttons look exactly the same.“I just have this feeling in the pit of my stomach that we are headed toward a bad situation here” said a White House aide who asked to remain anonymous. "There have been a few close calls already."Biden's Life Alert button is big and red and says "HELP" on it and the nuclear launch button is big and red and says "NUKE" on it a design decision the Biden administration is now regretting. He also has a personal Life Alert button he wears around his neck but for convenience's sake he has a nuclear launch button around his neck as well and it says "Launch Alert" on it which officials are now admitting was a bad naming choice. And since Biden is constantly getting lost wandering around the White House looking for ice cream falling down and calling for help many are wondering how this could possibly end well.“Let’s just be frank about this” said another aide gravely. “One of these days he’s going to fall and can’t get up and start a nuclear war and then we’re all going to fall and can’t get up.”

Every time he sees a white person he reflexively yells ‘RACIST’ and punches them in the groin. He's years ahead of his classmates!”Chicago added a CRT section to their standardized testing last fall which allows the district to compare students’ understanding of race relations across different schools. Since most second-graders in Chicago can’t read the test involved showing photos of people with different skin colors to the students then asking how hard the students wanted to punch each photo.The children were then shown flashcards of everyday objects such as apples trees books chairs and pencils and asked to identify which items were racist. Scotty earned perfect marks on both tests: he only punched the white people on the first test and properly identified each of the 132 everyday objects as racist in the second.Martinelli said Scotty will be part of a pilot that sends a few promising third-graders to high school next fall to take advanced-level racism courses. “It will be a great opportunity for Scotty to continue his progress in CRT” she said. “He might even learn to read in the process.”

In a compromise with Republicans authorities are letting the first name of "George" remain unchanged."We are overjoyed" said BLM co-founder Patrisse Cullors from the balcony of her new three-story seaside villa in the Bahamas. "George Floyd has done more for America than George Washington could ever dream of. I mean-- what did Washington ever do? Wear a wig and have bad teeth?""This will be an everlasting monument to the integrity wisdom and pure angelic goodness of Saint Floyd-- the man who saved America by giving us an excuse to dismantle it.""We are also overjoyed" said Bob Three Eagle a Sioux Nation Tribal Council member. "Mount Rushmore stands as an everlasting symbol of the theft and desecration of our lands. But if our land and memory are going to be desecrated we want them to be desecrated by George Floyd-- the hero of the oppressed."Nancy Pelosi has announced she will be at the unveiling ceremony to offer up a prayer and thank George Floyd for dying for the cause of justice. They will then play music as the citizens of South Dakota collectively face the monument and bow down before it.Democrats hope this change will be the first step to replacing the remaining faces with likenesses of Malcolm X Joseph Stalin and Karl Marx.

"We had it all set up-- pin the crack pipe on Hunter a Mike Pence piñata-- then the baker throws a fit about writing 'Trump Won' on a cake!

"We here at the 'Do Better Bakery' exist to support diversity equity and inclusion. It's why I've moved to using only black flour baking bread that identifies as cake and occasionally firing myself out of guilt. And this guy wants me to bless the Big Lie with cake? I'd rather take this mask off catch COVID not take hydroxychloroquine and die!"Attorney General Merrick Garland his schedule cleared after recently being smacked down by the Supreme Court took time to weigh in on the case.

All thanks to our president!3) Go back in time to 1906 and treat yourself to 16 pieces of penny candy at the general store: You haven't lived until you've experienced the childlike joy of penny candy from a century-old general store.

The move received praise from both sides of the political aisle as a $60 bus ticket per inmate will free up millions to be spent on more important issues like funding a border wall in Egypt.Chicago’s Mayor Lori Lightfoot praised the decision to free those poor innocent federal criminals into the peaceful bastion of Chicago where there has been no violence during her tenure. Then speaking louder in order to be heard over the gunfire Mayor Lightfoot clarified that the bodies of gun victims piling up around them were the result of racism.When a blood-soaked reporter stated “Ummm what” Mayor Lightfoot justifiably accused him of racism and sexism.Inspired by AG Garland’s brilliance Texas Governor Abbott has begun filling Chicago-bound buses with residents of Austin.
'July 3rd 2021',https://babylonbee.com/news/7-signs-you-might-have-been-radicalized-on-facebook,"7 Signs You Might Have Been Radicalized On Facebook",So you're at a 4th of July cookout when all your friends and family start discussing Facebook's Orwellian alert about being exposed to extremism - when it dawns on you that everyone you know has received this alert except for you! Are you the person Facebook is warning everyone about? Did you become radicalized and not even know it? Here are seven helpful clues to look for to know if you've become a dangerous extemist on Facebook:1. You don't immediately start shrieking in terror whenever you see an American Flag: The American Flag is one of the most extreme and evil symbols of hate and white supremacy ever. If you don't have a severe fit of blinding rage followed by angry posts on Facebook every time you see an American flag you are complicit! Test yourself by looking at this hate emoji: 🇺🇸2. You liked a quote by Thomas Sowell: believing in capitalism and individual merit is like enacting your own private insurrection every day of the year. Repent!3. You clicked on a link from the Daily Wire: the Daily Wire is like the insurrectionist newsletter. When insurrectionists are tired from overthrowing the government they sit down and read the Daily Wire to learn more reasons why they should overthrow the government.4. You engaged in outrageous COVID conspiracies about hydroxychloroquine COVID originating in Wuhan's lab and schools being safe to open: at least if you said these things before June 13th 2021 at 4:56 p.m. when all of that became cool.5. You did not press "like" when one of your friends said that Trump was Hitler: believing that Trump was not the second coming of Hitler is a gateway to the Alt-Right. Didn't you know Facebook sees you every time you scroll past a "TRUMP IS HITLER" comment without liking it? They're always watching.6. You gave a thumbs up to one of those videos of Israel's 'Iron Dome': this one is extra bad because it's like saying you are on board with the atrocities committed by the white supremacist state of Israel. They are brazenly oppressing indigenous missiles and all you have to say is 'me like'?7. You post videos of yourself dressed as a buffalo storming the Capitol: a tell-tale sign though this does require context. Violent revolts can be mainstream and peaceful if done for the right reasons so just make sure there are no Republicans around if you're taking selfie videos while attacking federal buildings.Check your feed carefully and if you notice any of these signs in one of your friends be sure to report them! We're not going to stamp out extremism without you turning in your friends and family - one step closer to utopia!

The masked hero claims that ever since a horrible childhood accident that left him blind he hasn’t been able to see race."I'm colorblind" he said exposing his own inherent tendency to center whiteness. “I can’t see anything at all much less the color of someone’s skin.”“Why would I need to see the color of a person’s skin to fight my way through and take down the criminal underworld?” Daredevil continued his white fragility beginning to show through. “Justice is blind and so am I.”Wilson Fisk a well-respected local businessman has called out Daredevil saying “It’s bad enough that this man is taking justice into his own hands but now he’s openly refusing to acknowledge race. This so-called “hero” does not represent who we are.”Daredevil has been labeled a far-right extremist for his unwillingness to see the racial realities around him.Mr. Fisk has appointed heroes such as Bullseye and Elektra to step up and confront Daredevil as he remains blind to systematic inequality that can only be addressed by viewing race even more.The Defenders have announced that Daredevil has been removed from the team until Daredevil has educated himself admitted his racism and committed himself to do the work of becoming an anti-racist who always sees race.

And since we always trust the experts we believe her. When have experts ever been wrong after all? Can't think of a single time especially in the last year.But the condo collapse wasn't the first time climate change has punched humanity in the face. Here are ten disasters caused by climate change:1. The Hindenburg disaster - If the weather had been cooler it wouldn't have caught fire. Thanks climate change!2. The Jan. 6 capitol riots - Climate change radicalized Trump supporters who couldn't think clearly in the heat. Plus they had to start going shirtless and wearing buffalo skins. Because of the heat.3. The Destruction of Alderaan - Scientists now believe that the global temperature on Alderaan heated very rapidly just before it blew up. Should have had more regulations!4. Chernobyl - The Soviet Union was oppressed by climate change-causing capitalists in the Cold War causing them to blow up their nuclear plants? Or something.5. The defeat of the English at Bannockburn in 1314 - The dastardly Scots only won because they were wearing kilts allowing them to weather climate change's deadly heat.6. Taylor Swift's transition to pop music - Just listen to the difference between     "Teardrops on My Guitar" and "Shake It Off" - a true tragedy. Caused by climate change.7. Cats (2019) - We can only think this must have been climate change.8. The Monica Lewinsky scandal - Bill Clinton's interns had to wear more revealing clothes to weather climate change. Curse you climate change!9. Hyperinflation under Biden - It's either Trump's fault or climate change.10. The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah - It's the only explanation.What other disasters might have been caused by climate change?

The 19-gallon tank in his 2016 Camaro cost nearly $95 to fill up and he was feeling pretty down about how expensive gas is under the Biden administration—that is until he pulled up Twitter and saw that a slice of cheese would cost him 16 cents less this year thanks to Uncle Joe."Wow -- a whole 16 cents! Thanks Biden!" he said his mood having instantly shifted to one of joy and optimism. "This will change everything! I'd better drive home and tell the wife!" He happily drove toward his house spending over $5 in gas to drive the 20 miles home.Americans everywhere are pumped for the full 16 cents they will be saving on barbecues this year as long as they don't have to drive anywhere to pick up their groceries since the gas costs would offset any savings on onions mustard and relish. But according to the White House as long as the nation is willing to walk to the grocery store keep their air conditioning off and not buy any chips or soda they'll have a full 16 cents to burn."And you can take that to the bank!" said President Biden happily. "16 cents will buy a lot. You can go get a sody pop down at the hop pick up 16 candies or even go see one of those new talkies!"

And to run it she has chosen the organization Antifa.“Who better than an anti-fascist movement to investigate the terrible terrorism of January 6th?” Pelosi asked the press before black-masked Antifa leader Squiggy (they/them) took the stage.Squiggy immediately pointed at Pelosi. “Who is this old lady? Is she a Nazi? Someone beat her up!”“I’m the one who hired you” Pelosi said. “You’re supposed to focus on the Capitol.”“Oh yeah.” Squiggy then spoke to the press. “We will smash the Capitol building and burn it down until we get a written letter from everyone that they will do no more fascism.”“You’re investigating the riot from January 6th” Pelosi told Squiggy.“Oh yeah” Squiggy said. “We’re going to watch videos investigate and then I’m not sure what we’ll smash and set fire to. So I guess we’ll play that by ear.”Antifa has already released some findings from the investigation saying that they saw a bunch of rioters running around breaking things stealing things and attacking people so thus far they’ve observed “nothing unusual.”

"Almost no actors in Hollywood perform their own stunts whether that's walking up some steps getting up from bed or reaching a particularly high shelf. We just can't risk our star actor getting injured trying to bend over and pick up a cursed idol or crystal alien skull thing."Unfortunately the spry and energetic Ford couldn't help himself and told his stuntman to stand aside as he would walk up the stairs himself in one scene."I told him. I told him over and over. Stairs are a young man's game" sighed Director James Mangold. "One flight maybe but two? No way that's stunt man territory. But once he gets into character there's no reasoning with the guy."The accident reportedly occurred while filming a scene in which Indy disguised once again as a Nazi is attempting to recover the most coveted artifact of the Nazi party: Nancy Pelosi's podium. Indy was on his way to the roof for a helicopter escape when gravity finally caught up with Professor Jones.Mr. Ford reportedly blames the Nazis for his fall given their penchant for slick well polished boots. He tried to use his whip to catch a hold of the railing but managed only to smack a camera guy in the face."Honestly we're lucky this didn't happen before" said co-star Phoebe Waller-Bridge. "Initialy we tried to get Harrison to let the stunt man help with all the risky stuff - stepping off curbs getting out of the shower - but he would have none of it. Still I tried my hardest to talk Harrison out of the stairs that was insane - like asking a giraffe to cross a glacier. Could see that fall coming a mile away."

Originally thought to be a deranged conspiracy theory the idea that CRT escaped from a liberal arts program is now accepted as mainstream consensus."While many believed the deadly CRT virus arose naturally out of centuries of systemic oppression it now appears to have been manmade" said Dr. Xander Willow of Hillsdale College. "It looks like some good-for-nothing liberal arts majors were messing around with some old law textbooks and experimenting with applying critical race theory to all of life. As we can see their gain-of-racism research had terrible results."While researchers could not trace the virus all the way back to patient zero scientific evidence indicates the first carrier of CRT was "almost certainly a white woman with purple hair who screamed a lot." "Yeah her name was probably Chloe or Claire. Or maybe Karen. It's hard to tell based on the evidence we have but genetics indicates this virus definitely evolved from a woman afflicted by white guilt.""Her actions in developing and releasing this virus on the population may prove to be deadlier than any other virus yet."To fight CRT experts are recommending loving your neighbor no matter what their skin color is seeing a person instead of a race and reading your Bible. Also hydroxychloroquine.

His election theft will be fully exposed any day now leading to Donald Trump being reinstated as president. Thus Biden is trying to Marxism even harder and faster while he still has the power.“I want new ideas each day to destroy freedom and the family structure” Biden told his staffers and fellow Democrats in a pep talk. “We need full Communism and we need it now.”“How much time do we have?” asked Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.“Not a lot” said Biden. “The My Pillow guy is really on to us. So we need to turn the American dream into a nightmare as quickly as possible.”“It’s going to be hard with Republicans blocking the teaching of CRT in schools” stated Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.“I don’t want excuses; I want results” said Biden. “Each of you needs to say yourself ‘What would Mao do?’”“I made this hammer and sickle out of dried macaroni!” exclaimed Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as she held up a piece of paper with macaroni glued to it in the crude shape of the Communist symbol.“That’s great” said Biden. “It doesn’t help us at all but I like that you’re trying.”Representative Ilhan Omar raised her hand. “Can we kill the Jews?”“That will have to be a stretch goal” answered Biden. “Right now we have to focus on damaging this country as much as we can so even Trump can’t make it great again.”It is unknown exactly when Trump will be reinstated as President though it is expected to be very soon. Upon taking office he will begin to undo all the damage Biden has done though not immediately since it’s expected that his first few weeks back in office will be focused on having every American apologize to him personally.

But we know there are still a few skeptics out there. Here at the Bee our number one mission is to prevent the spread of misinformation and make sure everyone still has faith in our democracy.To help convince you here is the undeniable evidence the election was fair:1. Literally everyone says so: Duh. The 2020 election couldn't have been rigged because all the people who are cool and smart and not weird say so. Do you want to look like a weirdo? Ew.2. Journalists were fair and balanced in assessing the qualities of moderate kind decent Joe Biden and of his opponent Hitler: Thank God for the press! They really made sure to give a fair and honest assessment of the most popular and wonderful president ever and the evil orange monster who wanted to kill democracy and take away all our norms and stuff. Great job journalists!3. Mail-in votes were handled by USPS—the most reliable trustworthy company on the planet: The post office almost never screws up loses or delays US mail. It's quite amazing really.4. Vote counters in Philadelphia and Detroit spent many years practicing how to count before election night: Some of them since kindergarten! The election was truly in good hands.5. The Democrats have never done anything wrong ever: Not ever.6. Posters and barricades were held up to block people from seeing the unprecedented blinding levels of vote counting fairness: Poll watchers showed up but their eyeballs would have been burned out by the awe-inspiring amount of vote counting integrity. Many lives saved!7. Absolutely nobody was threatened behind a poolhouse by a chain-wielding Biden: Biden is a fine upstanding man of integrity and would never do something like that.8. New York didn't just accidentally count 138000 ballots a bizarrely familiar number: Science has clearly shown that voter fraud is completely impossible and would never happen here especially in New York City where they're really good at elections.9. The election turned out exactly how your late great great grandfather would have wanted: This was verified by his vote in the 2020 election.10. The Democrat candidate won which is perhaps the most important sign of a fair and impartial election: The evil fascist dictator was voted out of office. Anything that was done to achieve this was fair right?We hope you have seen the light. Now shut up about the election you insurrectionist!NOT SATIRE: A Party Game of Theft. It all comes down to the Swing States. This is where the election is determined and where the battle lines are drawn. You can play either as the Incumbent President or you can play as a Swing State that has decided they are going to tilt the election in favor of the Challenger through a carefully orchestrated series of cheats before during and after Election Day. It's all against one. Hasn't it always been? Relax. It's just a board game.

A spokesman for the ACLU lauded the decision calling it a win for all Americans.The case in question Thompkins vs. Bismarck Elementary centered around 4th-grade student Timmy Thompkins who self-identifies as a teacher. Thompkins had been using the teacher’s lounge for several months without an issue until his homeroom teacher complained to the Principal.“I went into the teacher’s lounge to get some coffee and Timmy was there reading the newspaper. He called me Linda and kept talking about how much of a pain the kids were being today” said Bismarck Elementary teacher Linda Fairfield. “I complained to the principal and they banned Timmy from the teacher’s lounge.”Thompkins appealed the decision saying that since self-identifying as a teacher clearly makes him a teacher the ban violated his rights under the Equal Employment Opportunity Act. His lawyer agreed suing the district for age discrimination and unequal treatment.The case eventually made it to the Supreme Court which ruled in favor of Thompkins yesterday. “Since Mr. Thompkins’ status as a teacher is not in question this appears to be a case of unequal treatment by an employer” the majority opinion read. “Mr. Thompkins must immediately be granted access to the teacher’s lounge of Bismarck Elementary.”Thompkins has resumed his daily visits to the teacher’s lounge where he says his colleagues have welcomed him back with open arms. His teacher Mrs. Fairfield says she now self-identifies as a student and was seen playing on the monkey bars at recess.

Yay!"Baptist churches on the other hand are already gearing up for gluttony month which has always been their favorite month since gluttony isn't actually a real sin—like being gay or drinking alcohol. Church members around the country are preparing their favorite cheesy sausage noodle casseroles and double-fudge cream custard desserts.For thousands of Americans collecting unemployment even though there are plenty of jobs available for them it's already been sloth month for a while now.BLM and Antifa have shrugged off upcoming official months saying they can celebrate all seven deadly sins every day of the year.

And yet both parties continue to squabble. Many think this is the work of the enemy of roads: libertarians.Libertarians are subterranean humanoids who hate all U.S. roads and think they should be replaced by private roads where if you don’t pay a colossal corporation a dollar for every mile you drive you get blown up by a drone. Many suspect libertarians have put something in the Senators’ water to make them angry at each other instead of the cool friends they usually are-- so they'll fail to fund the roads.“You need to call your Senators and tell them to reach a deal to prevent the road-pocalypse” Highbottom pleaded. “If they don’t everyone will die... except those of us in the council because we’re safe up here in our zeppelin as we knew that one day this time would come.”

He is a Democrat and Democrats are Marxists and Marxists killed one hundred million people last century so Biden is probably planning to kill at least that many. Here are the signs to look for that Biden is about to go full dictator.1) Puts kids in cages: Dictator 101 stuff right here. Just shoves kids in cages and hopes you’ll forget about them.2) Pretends to be a senile old man as an excuse to forget about civil rights: If he keeps rambling and looking senile that just so later he can be all “What’s a Consitution? I don’t remember that.”3) Attempt a federal takeover of voting regulations: The easiest way to dictatorship is to control the elections.4) Has an evil henchwoman that chuckles at questions about human tragedy: Your pain and suffering is their amusement. Truly frightening.5) Talks in secret coded language disguised as old man gibberish (“Corn Pop was a bad dude”) to give commands to his secret police: Classic KGB tactic.6) Sniffs hair: If there's one thing dictators love it's sniffing hair. Why do you think Hitler and Stalin had mustaches? So they could smell hair all the time! Wake up America!7) Has his dog attack anyone who displeases him: That’s just straight-up Mr. Burns level evil. I’m sure he’ll say they’re “accidents” though.8) Threatens to nuke everyone: This one is kind of over the top; if it happens better start forming your underground resistance right away.Uh-Oh. Looks like we're in trouble!

"And when Pastor Greg started comparing Legolas' shield-surfing to Jesus walking on water it was all but confirmed that he was just reaching for a reason to use the video clip."When Golden moved into his last sermon point nearly an hour later he had reportedly played over fifteen separate clips from the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy."You know what?" he said to the droopy-eyed congregation. "Why don't we just watch the whole thing? The movies just explain it a lot better than I can. Ushers? Lock the doors." Church members began to panic and run for the exits but it was too late and the words they feared began playing from the church's speakers: "The world has changed. I see it in the water. I feel it in the Earth. I smell it in the air.""Well at least it isn't a congregational meeting" muttered one man as he settled back into his pew. "And it'll be a lot shorter too even with the extended versions.

Really getting into the metaphysical weeds here but to be safe we’ll leave them off the altar until Joe comes up and pull the ol’ switcheroo.”President Biden has reportedly been outraged over a movement to deny him the eucharist claiming that he does not personally support murder but simply supports women’s access to murder. He also supports forcing the public to pay for murder and wants to eliminate tax dollars going to crisis pregnancy centers that offer alternatives to murder – but to be clear once again he does not like murder.Sources say that President Biden has yet to notice the change but did remark that Communion has been extra tasty lately and always gives him a hankering for milk.

So what’s the solution to getting Latinx vaccinated? I dunno. Maybe there is no solution.”Biden also gave his theories on why more African-Americans aren’t getting vaccinated but we’d be canceled if we even repeated them.

She said she hopes the hoop change will lead to much more dunking in future WNBA games. “Currently less than 2% of our athletes are able to dunk a basketball on a regulation 10-foot hoop” Englebert said. “Our research has shown that utilizing 4-foot nets will increase that number to 38%. That’s going to be great for both our athletes and our fans.”The league is hoping that the increase in dunking will lead to a corresponding increase in fan attendance this season. “We’re really hoping to break the 500 mark in average attendance this year” Englebert said. “But honestly we’d be happy if fans in the stands outnumber players on the court for once.”

The nation will never recover. THAT IS MAHOGANY!The massive army of robot assassins who literally murdered AOC -- These guys were ruthless. RIP AOC. Fs in the chat for the world's smartest socialist.The deadly lectern thief --  Whole chapters in future history textbooks will be written about this guy who literally walked into the building and walked out with a piece of wood. We're talking John Wilkes Booth levels of impact on our country.This squirrel -- Just look at him. He's clearly up to something.This pigeon -- Dastardly.These professional insurrectionists who were having quite a bit of trouble climbing a wall -- Had they succeeded in climbing the wall the law of the land would have mandated that we make them our rulers. They would have had to fight Buffalo Guy in unarmed combat for the honor though.And the mastermind behind it all: this deranged lunatic who specifically told everyone to remain peaceful -- This psycho said "I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard." Truly the rallying cry of a madman.We know these pictures are hard to look at. But it's important to remember how terrible this day was so we will never repeat it.

The president ranted on and on about how if people were to rebel against his iron-fisted rule he would nuke them and send F-15 fighter jets to attack them in their homes. These statements alone were enough to convince millions of Americans the Second Amendment is still desperately needed to protect their natural right to defend themselves.People across the nation were swayed by Biden's convincing argument that your own government would have no qualms about nuking them or sending fighter jets to attack them convincing them once and for all that private gun ownership is super important for a free nation."The government would try to attack us with nukes and F-15s?" said one man in Iowa as he watched the video of Biden ranting incoherently about nuking his own people. "Yep better hang on to this AR-15. In fact I'd better go out and get five more.""Honestly I couldn't have made the case better if I tried" said one libertarian man in New Hampshire. "Not that I try to do anything. Really I just complain a lot and argue on the internet. Oh yeah and weed. I smoke a LOT of weed." Still he found enough energy to get up and go buy more guns.At publishing time every sporting goods store and gun shop in the country had named Joe Biden their salesman of the year with the president narrowly beating out Beto O'Rourke for the honor.

Even something as simple as sitting down and conversing rationally with a straight white male is a dangerous warning sign that your gender fluids are in for a much-needed overhaul.”When asked what the gender-fluid community can do to get these fluids replaced Prof. Fishman told us that all they must do is head down to their local Pep Genderless Young People service center and ask for the "Premium Pride Package." "That will keep those fluids running smoothly for an extended 6 months or 6000 Tiktok posts" stated Fishman."They will even install a rainbow-shaped chip in your wrist that will begin to flash when your next gender fluid change is needed! It can't get any easier than that!"

What chance can some "guerilla" group stand against our might? It'll never work.Maybe some day we'll invent flying machines and bombs that rocket through the air. By Jove when that happens no rebellion in the world will stand a chance. I for one can't wait. It will be a jolly good time and no government will ever lose against a pathetic farmers' rebellion again.

Some wealthier Americans purchased the F-22 while less fortunate citizens were forced to buy the F-35 joint fighter. But no matter what craft they chose American citizens said they were just glad to finally be protected against a tyrannical government."I need an F-15 to beat the government? Say no more fam!" said one man in New Hampshire as he happily rushed out to his local F-15 dealer to pick up the latest model. "Before I thought my AR-15 would be enough but when Biden pointed out that the U.S. government has fighter jets and I only have an assault rifle I realized I really needed to beef up my anti-tyranny defense systems.""Thanks Mr. Biden! I sure am glad you reminded me of how brutal a government can be against its own citizens and how governments throughout history have in fact attacked their own people once they are disarmed and helpless."The man was later seen picking up an M1 Abrams tank.

Today he announced that from now on he will be laser-focused on proving that he won the even more obviously rigged elections of 1860 1972 and 2008."No way and I mean no way I ever could lose to a guy like Racist Abe" said Mr. Trump from his balcony. "Last year I said I had done more for black people than anyone with the possible exception of Abe - and now look they are taking his statues down taking his name off of schools all because he is such a terrible racist! He was my only competition for the black vote and the great people of America have spoken and I won. Which means I won the Civil War which is terrific one of my best achievements probably top 50."Trump also proudly declared he had won the 1972 election defeating "Spyin' Dick" Nixon in an incredible landslide the biggest electoral college margin of victory ever maybe. "Spyin' Dick was such a loser. The Watergate hotel have you seen it? It's ugly it's awful I tried to have it torn down just to do the country a favor. And he lost Vietnam which is so sad for the Vietnamese people who I love very much. I love spring rolls. The fake news about him resigning it's all a cover up because everyone knew I really won the election. Sad!"Sources say that while upset about 1860 and 1972 foremost in Trump's mind is proving he is the rightful victor of the 2008 election over Cheatin' Barack. "Obama couldn't get elected president of the Lions Club and everyone knows about his birth certificate have you seen it? Worst photoshop I ever saw believe me. A disgrace to photoshop. The phony election - some states would not even put me on the ballot because they didn't want to embarrass poor Barack but I still won anyways which is so incredible. The evidence is all there and it is coming out FAST and FURIOUS now - which by the way I love Vin Diesel terrific guy but it's so sad what they've done to the franchise. Not good bowing to China - nothing like your favorite four-time president!"

This announcement comes as Catholic bishops grapple with a decision on denying Biden communion due to his stance on abortion. “The Bidens are more than welcome to come and receive communion at any UUA church” said pastor Butterfly Watkins of the Church Of the Divine Honeybee in Washington D.C. “We Unitarians will give communion to literally anyone. We want to be very clear that we have absolutely no standards whatsoever.” Watkins said the lack of doctrinal standards has been a hallmark of the UUA for more than 200 years and the church has no plans to adopt any in the future. “We don’t get too hung up on things like theology or religion” she said. “Heck we don’t even have any Bibles in the building. Those things in the pews are actually just old cookbooks we picked up at a yard sale.” President Biden seemed delighted by the invitation to join a different denomination. “I like [the UUA] a lot” Biden said. “They’re not in your face about believing things about God and stuff. They’re a lot like the Catholic church used to be before they got all preachy and religious.” Biden said he intends to worship at the Church of The Divine Honeybee soon and that his decision has nothing to do with the fact that there’s an ice cream parlor directly next door. “That’s just a happy little coincidence Jack” he said.

But quickly a plan was hatched: the clever children decided to dress themselves up as "mostly peaceful protesters" in hopes that Kamala would raise their bail and free them from captivity.Children from Central and South America dyed their hair purple donned Che Guevara T-shirts and began brandishing bricks and Molotov cocktails so that "la hiena del diablo" might see them and have mercy."It's a genius plan" said one CNN analyst.

And honesty that really hurts. But I won't let it get to me. Ultimately I need to follow my heart and live my own truth even if that means murdering fifteen million people.""I'm perfect just the way I am and for all the haters who try to tell me that my actions make me a horrible monster—well it's time to let it go." continued Hitler. "I'm tired of hiding from the world. It's time to embrace who I am. My uniqueness is a strength.""So I'm never ever going to give up. No matter what. Eradication of Germany's undesirables and world domination—it calls me!"Other entries included what seemed like Hitler's motivational pep talks to himself. "Keep growing keep fighting keep doing and always keep invading! And if you lose a world war get back up and start another one!" Hitler wrote. "Believe in yourself and there will come a day when others will have no choice but to believe with you... or else they'll be shot killed or imprisoned."Researchers have warned that as long as these ideas from Hitler's journal of always following your heart don't take root in popular culture and children's entertainment then there's nothing to worry about.

By completely dismantling the spirit of cooperation and bipartisan unity that we Democrats have built up over the years.”President Biden also weighed in on the lack of cooperation from congressional Republicans. “Cooperation is always tough” he said. “I play that game with my grandkids all the time but I can never get the funny bone out without making the buzzer go off. Say what were we talking about again?”  At press time Schumer said he and Pelosi said they were looking into forming a special “congressional unity task force” that would be responsible for jailing Republicans and their families for refusing to vote for Democrat bills.

That’s because just 78 seconds into the independent audit an official came across a ballot which had been digitally signed by University of Pennsylvania founder Benjamin Franklin. Franklin if he were alive today would be 316 years old; and due to a technicality has now become the oldest person ever to vote in a U.S. presidential election.“So yeah these Democrats are gonna have a lot of explaining to do” said Mike Lindell who just happened to be in town selling some pillows but figured he should make an appearance at the audit just in case. “I told you people all along this was fraud and look at this: BENJAMIN FRANKLIN!

Within hours auditors discovered that James Buchanan Henry J. Heinz and even Betsy Ross had all cast votes for Joe Biden in the 2020 election.

Hubbard would have been the first transgender woman to compete in the Olympics. The injury is not life-threatening but doctors have advised Hubbard that she needs to refrain from heavy lifting for at least six to eight weeks as her injury heals. Obviously that means Olympic weightlifting is off the table. Hubbard was something of a controversial figure at this year’s games given that she was born a biological male and competed as a male weightlifter until 2013. Many critics argued that this gave her an unfair advantage compared to female weightlifters but Hubbard says that’s ridiculous. “Sure there are some biological differences like bone density and muscle strength between the sexes” Hubbard said. “But none of those gives me an unfair advantage in weightlifting which is really more about finesse and technique!” Hubbard said while she's disappointed she won’t be able to live out her Olympic dreams this year that’s just the way it goes. “Sometimes your testicles get in the way” Hubbard said. “That’s just something we gals have to deal with.”

Women’s rights are human rights. Kindness is everything” she continued. She then planted a yard sign in the church parking lot that said exactly that before flipping off a truck sporting an American flag that was driving by in what the church says was a hate crime.“We’ve gotten some hateful attacks like that in the past for our stances” continued Pastor Martha. “For example some bigots would ask us on our Facebook and Twitter posts where we get our progressive positions from the Bible or historic Christianity but we have decided to be on the right side of history and not worry about those backwards-looking troglodytes. The big tech companies usually do a pretty good job of suspending those trolls for us anyway.”Pastor Martha is not afraid to voice her opinions mocking conservatives on her viral TikTok page either. “People should be able to be whoever they want to be and love whoever they want to” she boldly proclaimed to an audience of mostly unchurched secular teenagers.At publishing time Open Table Methodist Church Of The Open Door was planning on bravely holding a socially distanced lecture in the summer of 2021 on slavery being bad.

Many see this as targeted at President Biden who is deeply Catholic but also likes to engage in Satanic goat worship.“It is simply our opinion that you can’t be a Catholic in good standing and also pledge allegiance to Satan while bowing down before a goat” said one bishop who wished to remain anonymous so Satanic goat worshippers don’t put a hex on him.As for Biden while he says Satan is a “bad dude much like Corn Pop” he still plans to ask Satan for his power while bowing down before a sinister-looking goat he named “Black Phillip” and Biden sees no conflict between this and his faith.A number of bishops do oppose denying Communion to Satanic goat worshipers though. They worry that this could put the church in direct conflict with Democrats — huge supporters of Satanic goat worship — making it harder for the church to work with them on issues such as poverty racism and the environment. Still they admit even if they were to be able to get past the Satanism there was still no getting past the baby murder.

But how can you celebrate your father while still continuing the important work of dismantling the patriarchy?We've got some ideas:1. Make Dad his favorite breakfast and then kick him in the groin. -- The best of both worlds: celebrating dad and also smashing the patriarchy.2. Give him kale instead of environmentally harmful steaks. -- Your dad will love it when you take him out to dinner tonight for a nice juicy kale salad.3. Instead of thanking fathers today thank single moms pet owners and people who are like a parent to their large collection of anime body pillows. -- Make sure dads don't feel special today. Thank literally everybody.4. Take Dad fishing and then kick him in the groin. -- He'll never see it coming as he's distracted trying to get his hook off a log.5. Make your dad turn off the sports and tune in to a moving lecture on intersectional feminism. -- Although the NFL is basically the same thing at this point.6. Refuse to laugh at your dad's jokes. -- Laughing at dad jokes just encourages the patriarchy and perpetuates oppression. Don't give in.7. Give your dad an expensive set of tools but make sure the tools are all pink. -- A pink toolset says "Dad I love and respect you but also gender is a social construct."8. Kick your dad in the groin and then when he's doubled over in pain kick him in the groin. -- DOUBLE patriarchy smashing.Now go forth and smash the patriarchy! And also say Happy Father's Day to your dad. But mostly smash the patriarchy.

Should the ban prove successful Newsom says the next step will be to ban thinking altogether.Luckily for Newsom and California school teachers studies have shown that critical thinking hasn't really been taught in public schools in the past 50 years in the first place.

I thought it was offensive since I’m an Israeli Jew so I politely declined.”Greenstein said the customer was enraged at his refusal and took the matter to court. After Greenstein won at trial the customer eventually appealed to a federal circuit court where a judge overturned the ruling.“The American right to cake is just as sacred as the right to kill unborn babies choose your own pronouns and vote by mail without showing ID or proof of citizenship” the judge said in his scathing 12-page ruling. “As such I decree that Jake Bakes Cakes must bake the ‘Death To Israel’ cake.""Furthermore the cake must be chocolaty and delicious with buttercream frosting that’s sweet but not too overpowering" the judge continued. "And everyone must wear masks while baking it lest any COVID particles get into the batter. Thus sayeth the government.”Greenstein said he plans to appeal the decision all the way to the supreme court if necessary but that he’s having trouble finding a lawyer. “Most of the law firms I’ve talked to said they're refusing to take my case because I’m Jewish” he said.

Alaska.”“Agreed!” Putin said. “What contest do you suggest?”“Ice cream eating” Biden stated.Putin laughed. “I will destroy you at this! You are old and feeble and probably lactose intolerant!”Each of them was handed a two-scoop ice cream cone. A buzzer sounded and they went to work. Putin dove in immediately taking large bites but Biden took a slow approach taking big careful licks.“Idiot fool!” Putin exclaimed in between bites. “You are so slow and stupid!” But Putin soon grabbed his head and fell to the ground. “Aieee! Ice cream headache!”“Slow and steady wins the race Jack” Biden said as he continued to lick his ice cream cone.Biden soon finished all his ice cream before Putin was able to recover winning the contest. “I am humiliated!” yelled Putin as he ran off crying. “I will never show my face again!”This masterclass in diplomacy is sure to be studied centuries from now.

If Captain Nemo and Jeff Bezos can do it so can you!5. Staple your mouth shut and surgically remove your texting thumbs: avoid temptation at all costs.6. Be perfectly sinless from birth until your death: No sins no cancellation right? Jesus was able to do it and-- no wait-- he still got canceled. Nevermind.7. Hang a BLM flag pride flag and trans flag outside your house: Hang up all the flags. Be sure to update your pride flag every time they add a new color or you're a bigot.8. Make a deal with the Devil to never be canceled for the low price of your soul: What good is a soul anyway if you've been canceled? Last we checked deals with the devil are currently available in Washington D.C. and most Disney retail stores.If these 8 tips don't work for you get help from People United For Privacy Foundation!NOT SATIRE: People United for Privacy Foundation is fighting for free speech and to protect citizen privacy.Radicals in Congress and cancel culture are attacking the First Amendment by trying to force non-profits to expose their donors.

Witnesses heard him say "UGH! This game is taking FOREVER to download!""As soon as the words escaped my mouth I saw my Dad out of the corner of my eye and I knew I had made a terrible mistake" said the exasperated Braidlen.His Dad casually walked over sat down next to his son and took a deep breath."YOU KNOW SON back when I was a kid we didn't have nice iPads with backlit screens with millions of free games to download. I didn't have Wi-Fi! I had something called a Game Boy! Do you know how we got our games? We had to go to this place called a STORE and pay 8 weeks of allowance for a cartridge that only played one game! Man you kids got it easy. The screen was black and white and it had no light so you had to play while holding a flashlight in your teeth or by holding up the screen to passing street lights while you sat in the way back of an Oldsmobile station wagon! Do you even know what the way back of a station wagon was like back then? The seats were backward! You faced backward son! You had to stare down the headlights of the car right behind you while looking at a dark screen. And don't even get me started on batteries. We didn't have lithium-ion back then! You had to go to the store again and get 4 AA batteries which gave you about 8 hours of battery life even though the Game Boy package said they would give you 20 which was a total lie and when your batteries ran out do you know what you'd have to do? You'd have to wait for your Mom to go to the store and get more batteries so you could play your game again. And half the time she'd forget so you'd have to take batteries out of your Walkman in order to play your Game Boy! Do you even know what a Walkman is? It's how we had to listen to music back then. They used things called 'tapes.' it was crazy. We couldn't just go on Spotify and listen to whatever we wanted to. Sometimes you kids just don't know how good you have it. You know-- in our games you couldn't just save it and walk away whenever you wanted. You had to get good at them until you were really skilled-- not like today where you can just turn the thing off and it automatically saves your place. And if we got stuck in a game? Guess what! NO INTERNET! We had to go to a store called Electronics Boutique and secretly look at a big walkthrough book without buying it and then sneak out! Yeah things didn't come easy back then I'll tell you what! And have you ever heard of Hamburger Helper? We had to eat that every single night. We didn't have all this fancy gluten-free hypoallergenic stuff you kids have to eat now. It really built character I'll tell you what! You know I--"..."Uh son?""Son where are you going?"

Yesterday though everything in the universe seemed to be pointing against the existence of a loving Creator. For starters his daughter had woken him up at 5:15 because they had run out of bananas. Why didn't they ever wake up their Mom instead?Tim groggily checked his phone and his buddy without kids had texted him a picture from their Cabo vacation. Between work church and kids Tim hadn't even seen a movie in the past year. What was he even doing with his life? His phone rang-- emergency at  work-- and he dashed to the car forgetting to grab a granola bar. After all those of years of school and piling up debt Tim still was the low man on the ladder at work. It just wasn't fair. What was it all for?He got a message from his wife on the way to work asking him to try to make it home on time that night she needed him to take care of something. Why was everything up to him??As work drug on through the morning the dread crept in. What's the meaning of any of this???Tim was nearing the edge of despair when he realized it was already past lunchtime. He ran across the street from the hospital to his favorite Mexican restaurant and got a burrito though he couldn't bring himself to pray before the meal.Three bites in Tim remembered what a gift from God their child was. Two bites later he remembered that instead of vacations he had spent countless afternoons at the park playing with his beautiful daughter and wife. Four more bites and he remembered how much it meant to him to get to be able to provide for his family. As he finished the last bite he remembered how he wouldn't trade being the one to care for his family for anything."Thanks God. Thanks for that burrito" whispered Tim as he ran back to work.

This has led to some states such as Texas and Florida banning teaching it to children. Some teachers though have found a way around the ban so they can still pass on their progressive ideals to young students.“I was just thinking: What’s the essence of CRT?” said teacher Audrey Davidson. “And it occurred to me we can still honor the spirit of CRT without actually teaching it — and that spirit is beating white kids with sticks for being white.”With this new practice — carefully not labeled CRT — the teachers will go to white students and say “This is because you’re white!” and whack the kid on the head with a stick. This way everyone learns whiteness is bad without CRT ever coming up.This new beating of white kids with sticks is controversial but right now there appears to be little anyone can do about it. “They got us over a barrel on this one” said Texas Governor Greg “Tex” Abbott “It’s not like we can ban beating kids with sticks; this is Texas. Kids need a good stick-beating — but they should get it not because of the color of their skin but because they’re ornery. Yee-haw!”Teachers are also considering some other practices to stealth teach CRT such as stealing the lunch money of white kids and then giving it to minority children (though probably not to Asians).

"It filled a very big hole in Christian theology that needed to be filled. The only possible explanation is that it was divinely inspired.""Yeah the Apostle Paul really blew it" said another member. "Not only was he a white misogynist who condemned women pastors but he also completely failed to address the central gospel issue of dismantling systemic racism. What were you thinking Paul?""We need to be clear" said Oblob. "We do not support Critical Race Theory. We simply support the idea that our theology is systemically racist against oppressed minorities who experience oppression in different intersectional ways that the main imperative of the church in this century is to liberate oppressed minorities from our cultural hegemony and that we must decolonize our teaching of scripture and also dismantle the West. That has nothing to do with Critical Race Theory."All eyes will be on the convention this week as people wonder whether the SBC will continue to thrive for years to come or whether they're just a couple of decades behind the Methodists.

Men ran head-on into machine-gun fire and certain death. Do you think today’s generation could do that? No! They’d be like “That’s too dangerous! I need to wear three masks get a vaccine and then hide in my home to avoid a 0.00001% chance of death!”What happened to people? Well ole Frank will tell you what happened. Playground equipment. It’s all fiberglass funhouses over rubber and covered in caution signs to make sure little Timmy doesn’t get a scrape. It all tells children the lie that the world is supposed to be safe and easy.You know what playground equipment was when I was a child? Barbed wire you dangled from over broken glass. Because my parents who spent their formative years stabbing Nazis in the face knew the world was full of danger and death. Wrapping your kids in bubble wrap to prevent cuts and bruises doesn’t stop the Commies from nuking us so why pretend you can make people safe?But at some point we started raising kids wrong. You know who I blame? Hippies. One of my biggest regrets was I didn’t punch enough hippies back in the day; maybe things would have turned out better if I did. But those hippies wanted to pretend the world was full of love and happiness and decided you needed to coddle children. Soon they’re all wearing seatbelts and bike helmets. Now it’s masks. And it’s just going to keep going from there until we seal kids in boxes full of foam insulation.It’s child abuse to keep kids that safe. They need danger. They need to know the world for real. That’s why we need a movement to make playground equipment more dangerous. It can start simple. Lay a few tacks under the monkey bars. Loosen the bolts holding the slide on. Release an angry dog that will get you if you ever fall. Eventually we’ll move it up to rickety metal structures over hard unforgiving pavement.Is that scaring you? Well shut up or I’ll punch you like you were a hippie. The world is scary. And that’s the truth the kids need to know. Now if they can get through all that without being horribly mangled they’ll be ready the next time the world needs people to charge into machine gunfire. Well don’t go straight into it — zig-zag a little it’s safer.

I mean are you kidding me?" said Ilhan Omar. "That has to be like eight Jews in a row now as prime minister. Israel really can't find one Hamas guy or one ISIS guy out there that can do the job? And people want to try to tell us they haven't established an apartheid state. Ridiculous."Although still head of the most popular party in Israel Prime Minister Netanyahu has become something of an international pariah for continuing to insist that his country ought to exist. His twelve years as prime minister have been marred by several refusals to have all the Jewish people lay down their weapons and die. As word spread that a coalition government would finally oust Mr. Netanyahu the entire United Nations along with America's Democratic party began hoping that the new leadership would reconsider accepting Jewish annihilation - but it was not to be."Heard it's another Jew" sighed Rashida Tlaib. "I can't say I'm surprised. My entire life Israel has just gone from one Jew to the next. Israel is one of those free capitalist countries so you have to expect that kind of bigotry. Would have accepted any self-loathing non-religious guy though deep down I had hoped for a lemming that would simply lead them all into the sea."Sources say the new coalition government will set a historical first by including the main party representing Arabs who reside in Israel. The Arab inclusion within Israel's ruling coalition prompted outrage from Representative Ocasio-Cortez who likened it to black Americans running on the Republican ticket. "It's like enjoy apartheid much? I just can't believe Middle East Arabs would work together with Jews. It's like black people here working with police to help make communities safer it's so triggering. Of all people those Arabs should know better-- it will only be more of the same 'we have a right to live' and 'we need missiles to stop Hamas from bombing nursing homes'. Classic Jew moves!"

"Trust us -- when have we ever been wrong about anything?"From Boris Johnson and Joe Biden to Justin Trudeau and that weird French guy members of the summit had pushed harmful economic policies rather than just letting the people reach herd immunity and go on with their lives. But they're now claiming they are the people you need to listen to for reopening the very economies that they destroyed.At publishing time the entire world was praying for a giant tidal wave to hit the beach where the attendees were gathered.
'June 11th 2021',https://babylonbee.com/news/the-babylon-bee-guide-to-bitcoin,"The Babylon Bee Guide To Crypto",Brought to you byBitcoin! Crypto! Doge to the moon! What the heck does all this stuff mean anyway? Some of us are libertarians so we have to pretend to know all about cryptocurrency. But we decided it was finally time to actually research crypto and find out what it is -- and we're here to share that knowledge with you dear reader!When did cryptocurrency get its start? A bunch of libertarians were sitting around shooting beer cans after a Ron Paul rally in 2008 and one of them was like "Dude. Money - but like - no Federal Reserve bro. Whooooa." And all his buddies were like "whoooooooa" and they decided to invent decentralized money.But what IS cryptocurrency? Cryptocurrency is a completely virtual currency that exists only online. You never have to worry about using your wallet because there's no physical money to keep track of. All you have to do is remember one simple 38-character hexadecimal password answer the bridgekeeper's five three questions and go on a quest across the galaxy to retrieve all six Infinity Stones to access your account. Easy! There's also stuff about mining and blockchains and stuff but honestly we still don't understand it.Are there different types of cryptocurrency?Yes. Currencies like Bitcoin and Dogecoin are probably the most popular but there are hundreds of different types! Some lesser-known varieties include the following:What is cryptocurrency used for?Cryptocurrency can be used for many things such as paying off Russian hackers who are holding your mainframe hostage with ransomware. It's also a great conversation starter -- you can easily pick up women by launching into a 90-minute lecture on how crypto works.Is cryptocurrency a stable investment? It's a great investment for people looking for something a little less risky than shaky fake money like the U.S. dollar.Why are libertarians so obsessed with cryptocurrency?Because the government hasn't figured out how to reliably track and tax it yet. Plus the women thing.I've heard that cryptocurrency is used to support a lot of nefarious things like illegal drugs and arms trafficking. How can you support something like that in good conscience? Yeah that's a good point. Better stick to the U.S. dollar which is never used in any criminal activity.I bought a Bitcoin for $67000 last week. What's my investment worth today? Around $37.50. Wait - nope -- it's worth $1256292.52! You're rich! Nope -- It's worth $1.24 now. You shoulda sold!I've invented my own cryptocurrency called Sprinklecoin which is named after my Mexican hairless cat Sprinkles. What does this mean for me? Congratulations you're a billionaire! Try not to spend it all in one place.A billionaire? Really? That's amazing! Sorry while you were typing Elon Musk tweeted that he didn't like Sprinklecoin and now it's worth nothing! Better luck next time!NOT SATIRE: The Foundation for Economic Education is on a mission to inspire educate and equip America's rising generation with the economic ethical and legal principles of a free society.These principles include free enterprise individual liberty limited government and entrepreneurship -- such as advancing free-market innovations like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies!Please consider supporting our efforts by making a donation of $10 $35 $50 $100 $250 $500 $1000 or ANY amount by clicking here.Thank youZilvinas SilenasPresidentFoundation for Economic Education
'June 11th 2021',https://babylonbee.com/news/7-problematic-characters-in-the-lord-of-the-rings,"The 7 Most Problematic Characters In The Lord Of The Rings",Here at The Babylon Bee we always make sure to impose our modern woke narrative on authors who lived decades or even centuries ago. It's the only way to truly figure out what a text really means.One author who has come up recently as being problematic is J.R.R. Tolkien what with Orcs vs. Men clearly being some kind of racial thing. And look at Arwen! She just stays in Rivendell while the men do all the fighting. Very problematic!Here are seven toxic characters who should have been cut from the books:1. Gandalf the White perpetuates white supremacy. An obvious one we'll grant you that. But Gandalf denies his grey race and internalizes his own oppression by becoming white. Very problematic!2. Frodo and Sam being really good friends but not actually gay pushes a harmful heteronormative narrative. Two male friends who AREN'T token gay characters? Tolkien obviously never watched good entertainment on Netflix. Sad!3. Gollum mocks people with split personality disorders. Tolkien was promoting ableism here by mocking a poor mentally ill hobbit with at least two personalities. At least he used the proper ourses/theirses pronouns.4. The Balrog demonizes the demon community. OOOOOF COURSE the bad guy is a demon. How typical. Try subverting expectations next time Professor! Call Rian Johnson if you need help.5. Hobbits are a mockery of the obese community eating seven meals a day. Second breakfast? Elevenses? Afternoon tea? Every time a person of size reads Tolkien's references to Hobbits' eating habbits he or she dies a little inside. Very fatphobic.6. The Eagles are a problematic Nazi symbol. Another obvious one we picked up on right away. Why didn't they take the Eagles to Mordor? Probably because the Eagles were busy at a Nazi rally!7. Iluvatar perpetuates the idea that there is one God and is not very inclusive of atheists. Monotheistic propaganda! Not good!Lord of the Rings? More like Lord of the REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
'June 11th 2021',https://babylonbee.com/news/far-right-apostle-paul-bans-teaching-critical-race-theory-in-churches,"Far-Right Apostle Paul Bans Teaching Critical Race Theory In Churches",JERUSALEM—Known conservative and far-right zealot the Apostle Paul has banned teaching critical race theory in churches in a scathing letter to the Galatians sources have confirmed.In a brutal rebuke Paul dismantled the idea that we should classify people primarily according to their racial groups pointing out that in Christ Jesus we are all one."There is neither Jew nor Gentile neither slave nor free nor is there male and female for you are all one in Christ Jesus" the dangerous conspiracy theorist wrote effectively banning all Christian churches from teaching CRT. By dismantling the idea that anything except Christ should be our primary source of identity and oneness in the church the Apostle Paul undermined the very foundation of critical race theory upsetting many progressives in churches throughout Asia Minor."CRT is just a lens to look at Scripture through -- just a tool we use sometimes" said one female pastor of a house church in Corinth. "We can redeem it for the gospel."Paul is currently prepping a letter to rebuke the female pastor both for her support of CRT and for being a female pastor.Further correspondence from Paul also banned the teaching of critical race theory by arguing that Jesus Christ has dismantled the hatred between races through the power of the cross with the right-wing wacko saying "For he himself is our peace who has made the two groups one and has destroyed the barrier the dividing wall of hostility by setting aside in his flesh the law with its commands and regulations. His purpose was to create in himself one new humanity out of the two thus making peace and in one body to reconcile both of them to God through the cross by which he put to death their hostility."What a nutjob!

It's come to my attention that there are many human females out there who won't date me not because of anything I've done wrong but because of their deep-seated biases against Star Wars geeks.This is called geekphobia and it's a real problem.Look let's talk frankly here. If you won't date a guy who can talk for three hours straight about the Thrawn trilogy face it: you're a bigot. It's not your personal preferences that prevent you from dating me -- it's your bigotry and hatred against those who identify as fans of a 40-year-old science-fiction franchise and still play with Kenner action figures all day.Society has programmed you females to prefer men who have "upper body strength" and "social skills" and don't "endlessly debate how horrible the sequel films are with strangers on the internet late into the night." Like it or not preferring to date a man who doesn't "go on and on about how the prequels are looking increasingly good in light of what Disney did to Star Wars" and "talk about how Han shot first every time we watch the original trilogy" is because you've been brainwashed by a patriarchal society that has trained you to find more "masculine" and "less weird" qualities attractive in a mate.Frankly a lot of this boils down to normal guy privilege. What's normal guy privilege you may ask fair females of our species? Allow me to geeksplain. Normal guy privilege is the systemic advantages in the dating sphere enjoyed by guys who don't have pasty white skin from playing the Star Wars RPG in their basements every night who have useful marital skills like being able to hold a conversation without ranting about Rose Tico and who "take showers" and "don't have permanent body odor from playing old-school Star Wars games like Jedi Knight and Rogue Squadron into the early morning hours every evening."The truly woke females will confront their inherent biases and date a Star Wars geek immediately. It's the only way to end geekphobia for good.

"Why are you such an anti-Bible bigot!?Finally Osteen took a deep breath. "I apologize" he said smiling. "Whoops-a-daisy! I got a little well a little hot under the collar there. I hope y'all will forgive me. Anyway I'm the Bible and if you disagree with me you hate the Bible."Osteen is also saying he will continue to "follow the Scriptures" and wear a "mask" while at church so that everyone thinks he is a Christian.

"One of these days we're gonna get up to 3!""Curse you Bad Orange Man!"Just in the last several weeks the CNN crew has had to reset the counter almost every day as Trump's blaming of the virus on China the Wuhan lab leak theory and his claim that the police didn't clear Lafayette Park just for his photo op were all proven to be true. Some CNN employees were reportedly taking a shot every time Trump was proven to be correct about something that the media relentlessly called him a liar about but they were forced to stop before getting alcohol poisoning."Boys it's been a tough week but we'll turn things around soon" said Stelter in an attempt to rally the troops.

You know how I talk about black people heck you've heard me saying this stuff for forty years! He's my son for crying out loud - if you don't do things like confuse being black with being poor well then you ain't my son bucko!"For his part Hunter explained that he was extremely extremely high when he typed those text messages and in fact has no recollection of ever doing so or of the past 30 years. He did say however that he was pretty sure he had gotten a "Presidential N-Word Pass" from his dad's black friend so he was pretty sure it was cool.Brian Stelter jumped to Hunter's defense by spending his entire news segment repeatedly saying the N-word arguing that it really is a form of anti-racism much like segregation. Twitter and Facebook will now allow the term as well reportedly to help "decolonize the term's racist roots.""We're all Democrats here which I think makes us part black anyways so let's just put this behind us.

We know you don't always know how to use words good like we do so sometimes that can be tough for an oppressed immigrant like yourself. We deeply appreciate any clarification you can offer."Other members of "The Squad" immediately jumped to Omar's defense saying her "freedom of speech" was being trampled upon for even asking for clarification on her "Kill the Jews" statement."This is outrageous" said Representative Rashida Tlaib. "We oppressed female Muslims can't even eat breathe or call for the killing of an entire people without the whites jumping in to attack us. Until we women of color can safely call for the killing of the Jews without raising an eyebrow we won't truly have freedom of speech in the United States of America."Omar did eventually clarify her statement saying she didn't mean "kill the Jews" but rather "murder the Jews."

Well it might not all be as great as you think. Read on for a list of reasons homeschooling may completely ruin your kid.1. Homeschooling makes your children much more likely to grow up to become cisgender: Is that what you want Mom and Dad? Another cis-normative oppressor making trans people feel unsafe?2. If you homeschool your child will miss out on up-to-date works of literature written by trans people of color: Do you really want them to settle for outdated works like The Bible Shakespeare or The Tuttle Twins?3. Homeschool proms are really awkward: Don't make your poor kid go through that for goodness sake.4. Homeschooled girls will never experience the magic of sharing a locker room with a 6'4" trans woman named Larry: Don't let your kids miss out on this important life experience.5. Homeschooled kids usually grow up to be really polite: This is not a very useful character quality for social revolutionaries.6. If kids don't sit through 8 hours of soul-crushing zoom calls in public school how will they ever be prepared for a soul-crushing corporate job?: Your children are destined to be good little corporate worker bees. You NEED to prepare them.7. They will miss out on delicious school lunches: Square pizza and ultra-pasteurized skim milk from a cardboard box? Scrumptious!8. Denim skirts cause chafing: Just inhumane.9. They might finish their curriculum early and have more time to be radicalized on YouTube by Jordan Peterson videos: Jordan Peterson is a dangerous cult leader who may radicalize your child into making their bed. Not good!10. Children may learn that human beings have inherent value as made in God's image: Children who learn that their dignity comes from God and not race class or gender identity are not very useful for revolutionary Marxist social change-- er we mean a meaningful movement towards greater equity.NOT SATIRE: The Tuttle Twins children's book series is teaching the rising generation about the ideas of freedom free markets individual responsibility and American history. Many of these ideas are no longer taught in the classroom which is why we are on a mission to distribute 1000000 copies of the Tuttle Twins to families homeschoolers schools and libraries.It costs roughly $10 to print and distribute one copy of the Tuttle Twins. You can click here to help us distribute more copies of the Tuttle Twins with a tax-deductible gift of $10 $50 $100 or even more.Thank youConnor BoyackAuthor Tuttle Twins

Individuals will then self-administer the vaccine and self-report their vaccination status all from the comfort of their own homes.“Everyone will be able to receive the vaccine without having to miss work to travel to a vaccination site where they will wait in line for hours” McConnell noted. “Best of all nobody will be subjected to any racist ID checks!” Democrats were quick to criticize the proposal saying a self-reported mail-in vaccine program was ripe for fraud and dishonesty. McConnell quickly dispelled those notions saying they were nothing more than a transparent attempt to disenfranchise Republicans from getting vaccinated.

Sources say that this is the table where the "losers who have zero friends" sit."Yeah Romney has been sitting there a while-- due to being a loser" said one congressional aide. "He always eats his cheese sandwich by himself. One time a group of cool Democrats came by and pretended to be his friend but then they dumped his milk carton on his head and taped a 'kick me' sign on his back. Sometimes I feel bad for him but I never sit with him because I don't want people to call me a 'loser' too."In recent days Romney has been accompanied by former cool-guy Democrat Joe Manchin. Manchin is not allowed to sit with the Democrats anymore because they all found out he still likes the Constitution-- which everyone agrees is totally dorky and lame not to mention horribly racist."Haha look at those two dork losers over there" laughed popular girl AOC. "LOL they're so dumb." She then walked into a pole.Witnesses say that Manchin and Romney have become friends at the loser table talking about watching Star Trek and playing with model trains and perhaps switching parties.

"The only way she can redeem herself and be absolved of her racist sins is to release a carefully prepared public statement written by her publicist apologizing for using Aunt Jemima syrup. She then must make a large donation to my organization the National Action Network. Only then can she be allowed back in polite society."Several BLM founders disagreed insisting that Kemper should release a statement of apology and then donate to BLM instead.

Apparently God makes no exceptions on the sins he forgives so that means he also forgives racism something many modern people find unforgivable.“It really helps perpetuate white supremacy that God will forgive racism instead of condemning people for all eternity for it” said progressive Christian Russell Tyler. “I can see forgiving lying murder sexual morality (which should never have been a sin in the first place) but forgiving racism is just beyond the pale.”While many people are hunting down and condemning people with even the most tangential relationship with racism like Ellie Kemper activists feel God is undermining them by forgiving full-on KKK members and Nazis.“While we were told that ‘blasphemy of the Holy Spirit' is unforgivable no one even knows what that is” says CRT advocate Timothy Cannon. “The unforgivable sin should be racism-- since it’s the worst sin ever-- as modern society has determined. God needs to make it clear there is no coming back from that.”God so far has remained silent on calls for Him to repent for forgiving racism though activists make it clear that if he did apologize they would not forgive Him.

"Almighty Father we thank thee for this kale...": Sources say God mercifully blessed the kale even though it is a creation of the Devil.5. "Daddy God just... just... surround us with your awesomeness Daddy God. Let us see your face today...": God mercifully did not show his face to the worship leader who prayed this prayer sparing his life.6. "Lord it's been a rough day and I'm... glad... to finally... have time here in bed to... talk with... you... [snoring noises]": Credit for trying at least.7. "Dear God please help us think of a third conservative joke.": HAHA who would pray something like that? Certainly not us... shut up.8. "Hey God it's me. Haven't talked in a while since you let the Democrats steal the election. Please don't let everyone notice my pants are on backwards right now.":  We have no idea who prayed this but he seems like a very godly man and we're sure God answered his prayer.Man those were some rough ones!

"Even in these early days we are making sure to teach our child that she carries the blood of white colonial oppressors as well as oppressed people of color. This unique mix may make raising our child extremely difficult."Expert critical theorists also expressed worry that the child may grow up fighting a constant internal battle between her oppressor self and her oppressed self."It is very rare that these two sides achieve perfect equilibrium" said sociology Professor Tawdro Dingletook of Yale University. "It's likely this child will either be doomed to a lifetime of being an evil oppressor or a horribly oppressed minority. She will never fully belong on either side. This is why we need to bring back racial segregation--to keep this kind of thing from happening."Local non-college-educated electrician Joe Yoder disagrees.

"Republicans must pay. Yeah slavery is bad and all that but Republicans must face justice and pay reparations."According to sources reparations paid by Republicans to Democrats will then be paid as reparations to black-owned organizations to atone for the sin of slavery which will then be sent back to the democrat party to assist in reelection campaigns.

Innovation. When I was a kid I looked forward to a future of jet packs and space rockets. And we knew we would have it because every day we were innovating and building new things. And it didn’t matter what was going on. While I was stuck in a jungle in Vietnam fighting Commies we landed a man on the moon. We could do anything (except to convince those politicians in Washington to let us win that war).So what happened in the fifty years since then? Do we have our flying cars? Do we have our Mars colony? Oh no what we have instead is a new iPhone that looks just the same as last year’s iPhone. And we have new ways to yell and get angry at each other over long distances.Something happened to innovation. And I’ll tell you what. It was feminism.Now I know what you’re going to say: “Frank hates women.” Well that’s not true. I love women. They’re pretty and they smell nice. And it’s just a scientific fact that God used evolution to make women especially good at making sandwiches. Ask any male scientist about this (but make sure no lady scientist is around or he’ll get an earful).But feminism tells women they don’t need to use their natural sandwich-making ability to help out men. Instead they need to become CEOs firemen and MMA fighters. And where does that leave men?Think of what happens when a man tries to innovate these days. A guy will almost have figured out how to build a warp engine but suddenly he’s hungry. Can he ask a woman to make him a sandwich? No that’s “misogynistic.” So now he has to make the sandwich himself. But does he even have the ingredients? So now he has to go to the store. And when he gets back he has to fumble around because he just doesn’t have a woman’s natural sandwich-making ability. And by the time he’s finished eating that unsatisfactory sandwich he’s already forgotten his great idea. So he just gives up and instead makes another scheduling app for the iPhone or something.So you see? We need to restore the natural order of things. We need to free women from oppressive feminism and get them back to what they love doing: making men sandwiches. And then men will again have the time and energy to innovate so we will once again have a future of robots fighting with lasers in space. And with that bright future ahead we’ll no longer worry about silly things like it getting a few degrees hotter in the next fifty years. Who cares? We’ll be on Mars.And let’s get this fixed soon; I’m hungry.

To suggest otherwise is more American lies — just like the lies that I look like Winnie the Pooh when I in fact look like a more rugged Timothée Chalamet.”Xi went on further to say that if anyone in China got sick it was not bird flu but “totally regular flu” and that no weird diseases ever originate in China and everyone should stop looking into their Wuhan lab which is only working on “a new type of gum that never loses flavor.”The press conference was then interrupted by what looked like a number of doves flying overhead but Xi said they were not birds but tiny airplanes flown by mice as part of their new advanced Chinese air force which could “fend off an attack from any entity including the American Space Force.”

The agency noted that the man-cold is the root cause of over 600 million sick days each year.Symptoms of the common man-cold include runny nose sore throat coughing crying general loneliness and a loss of all hope. Symptoms are usually at their worst when the man’s wife or girlfriend is nearby.“Look we know how devastating the common man cold can be for your average male” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky explained on CNN. “I’ve heard stories of men who are bedridden for an entire week with this thing. It’s nothing to joke about.”A CNN poll showed an overwhelming 79% of men will follow the CDC guidelines and continue to mask up in avoidance of the man cold. Just 15% of men mostly blue-collar types said they’d never heard of the man cold. 6% of men said they only listen to Donald Trump when it comes to their health.“Look I’ll mask up for the rest of my life if it means I don’t have to experience that horrific cold ever again” explained Ryan Penta a husband and father of one from California. “Before 2020 I could count over 25 times I nearly died from that cold. 2020 though was a lifesaver. I didn’t get the cold once because I was masked up 25/7. So this thing’s not coming off!”

How do you remain true to your beliefs while being successful in a place run by people who want to cancel you forever? Here are 9 tips for survival:1. Leave immediately: Leave. GET OUT while you still can! These people are completely insane. Become a union pipe-fitter. They make more than college graduates anyway. You're welcome.2. Hide all your Thomas Sowell and Milton Friedman books in a secret compartment in your dorm: Hide them behind your alcohol and illegal drugs where your resident advisor will never find them.3. Become an underground mole person and never make contact with another human being: Simple. dig a deep tunnel underground and attend all your classes online. Speak to no one.4. Pay a pink-haired intersectional feminist to attend classes for you: May be expensive but totally worth it.5. Start every non-leftist opinion with "Well what would you say to my racist Uncle Bill who thinks...": Always blame racist Uncle Bill.6. If you slip up and accidentally state a libertarian opinion end it by saying "...but that's just my lived experience.": Lived experience is like magical fairy dust you can sprinkle on almost any opinion to instantly make it valid. (NOTE: works better if you are a member of a marginalized population)7. Challenge all the woke professors to call down fire from Heaven to consume a burnt offering: Feeling bold? Channel the prophet Elijah and show those commies who's in charge!8. Pretend to be mute: Also remove your hands so no one pressures you to use sign language.9. Every time you come to a test question you are unsure about ask yourself-- "What is the worst most idiotic answer I can possibly imagine?": That's probably what the teacher is looking for.Follow these simple tips and you'll be fine!

Thirty full days of celebrating all the letters in the LGBTQ+ alphabet -- what fun! We at The Babylon Bee don't want to get left behind of course so let's kick off Pride Month with a list of our top two genders!We had all our writers vote on their favorite genders and narrowed it down to just the best two. Here they are:1. Women - Women took the top slot this year. Congratulations women! Women are great. One of the best genders of all time-- everyone says so. They are really beautiful to look at especially when they are married to you and they smile at you with those beautiful faces of theirs. According to experts women make life worth living and fill the world with sweetness warmth and love! They have the amazing ability to think about 32 things at the same time and predict infinite possible outcomes to every scenario kind of like Dr. Strange. Amazing!Women are so amazing in fact that men spent thousands of years fighting wars and building civilization just so women could have air conditioning. Many of us Babylon Bee writers have even selected one wonderful person of this gender to spend the rest of our lives with since they are so amazing.Great job women!2. Men - Coming in a close second was men. Many of us were surprised that men didn't take the top slot. They have the distinct advantage after all of being able to pick what restaurant they want to go to. They are handy around the house. They also drive better and are way better at telling Dad jokes. They also risk their lives climbing high telephone poles and working on dangerous oil rigs all so women can have air conditioning. But those factors just weren't enough to push them to the top. They tend to be way less good-looking than women and way smellier. Better luck next time men!Congrats to the winners and check back next year to see whether the same two genders top our list!

Mwuh ha ha ha!” DeSantis then signed the bill with ink he declared to be black no matter what anyone else thought about it.“Nooooo! Colors exist on a spectrum!” screamed an activist outside. “Who is to say the sky isn’t yellow? I guess maybe some sort of device that measures the wavelength and compares it to known color values but that doesn’t override people’s lived experiences!”DeSantis is said to be considering weighing in on other controversial divisive topics such as declaring that the sun is hot water is wet and two plus two equals four — all things PolitiFact rated as only “Half True.”

"If a dude thinks he's a woman it's only fair that he wear obnoxiously feminine clothes while doing so. Trans-women should be required to wear 5-in stilettos while competing with their fellow women. Come to think of it we should probably make them dress in full drag as well so they can fully honor their gender expression."Trans activists responded with an uproar calling the proposal unreasonable.According to opponents of Desantis's proposal some trans-women may struggle to run in high heels in spite of their massive man muscles due to the fact that some may not be used to walking in high heels. For this reason they have decided the proposal is unfair.The bill has passed and millions of Floridians are already purchasing tickets to watch biological men try to run in high-heels.

Well this ruins everything” said one man who had looked forward to the celebration but was instead climbing to the top of a building to get away from the ever-rising water.This was going to be a celebration unlike anything the world had ever seen and everyone was looking forward to it — except for Noah a notorious stick in the mud.“We’re all getting ready for a fun party” said Noah’s neighbor “and there he is working on some boat or something. He won’t even wear his pride robe.”The boat ended up being a boon for Noah as the flood covered the face of the entire earth and even led to some conspiracy theories that Noah knew this was going to happen.Thanks to all life being wiped out it will probably be a very long time before there is another pride month. Next time the people plan to use the rainbow symbol to constantly remind God during the festivities that no matter how wicked they get He said He wouldn’t flood them again.

This is especially important when enjoying media that's downright filthy.So next time you boot up a Grand Theft Auto game take a few minutes -- perhaps during the loading screens -- to reflect on these important spiritual truths and pictures of Christ the game has in spades:1. Murdering hookers reminds us of our depravity. - When you pay for a hooker's services and then run her over with your stolen sports car you will be powerfully reminded of how sinful and depraved you are pointing you to Christ. Wow!2. The three playable characters in GTA V reflect the Trinity. - You can play as Michael Trevor and Franklin switching between them at will just like the Trinity. Wait this one might be heresy actually. Still it's too much of a coincidence to ignore.3. We are reminded of God's justice when seventeen cop cars come screaming after us after we blew up a city block with a bazooka. - When the popo is hot on your tail gunning you down with helicopters and dozens of squad cars you'll be reminded of the justice of the Lord on the wicked. It's just like reading the Psalms.4. The game takes up like 100 GB of hard drive space reminding us that Christ should occupy our entire life. - Let the Lord take up your entire partition.5. Spending time in the game's strip clubs is good practice for evangelizing the hurting lost people of this world. - You will be moved to tears over how lost the strippers and the strip club patrons are in this game. It's a moving picture of how lost the world is and you'll find yourself turning off your Xbox and running outside to go evangelize the lost in no time!6. The game's compass and minimap guide us to the next mission very similar to how the Holy Spirit leads us to His divine appointments for us. - Another one that miiiight be heresy.7. Running over two dozen pedestrians in a garbage truck is a beautiful picture of the way Jesus runs over our sinful hearts when He saves us. - When Jesus saved you he ran you over like a dump truck. You'll praise the Lord for His salvation every time you go on a murderous rampage in a truck!Wow! Now go fire up your gaming PC to do some "devotionals" right this instant!

Total segregation doesn’t just happen overnight.”According to sources the half of the interview permitted will be the half where the journalist Mr. Washington will get to ask questions. Mayor Lightfoot will not provide any answers but will sit there for a full thirty minutes without blinking.Progressive Chicagoans expressed deep concern over the Mayor’s backtracking arguing the compromise may prove to be a slippery slope towards speaking to one-fourth black or even Korean journalists. Activists warned that a loss of strict racial standards could jeopardize all the wonderful progress the city had made on gun violence and allowing children to go to school.Outside City Hall Mr. Washington stated that he is still looking forward to the half-interview mostly to see what Mayor Lightfoot’s eyes look like in person. “Wonder if they’ll even realize I’m Samoan” he shrugged heading inside.

They play on a loop over and over again as people at the pumps fill up their cars paying the highest prices they've paid for gas in many years."Miss me yet?" Trump says in the 30-second spot. "If I were you I'd miss me. I'm the most missable person really. Everyone says so all the best people. I tried to warn you. I tried to warn you people what would happen. But no you didn't listen and now you're paying five bucks for gas. Sad! But I'll take you back. One thing about me is I'm very gracious. So let's get me back in the White House in 2024.

Many prisoners have noticed however that the Chinese officers staffing the gulag were not very diverse or concerned with things like what pronouns the prisoners preferred to be called.“At least our military was inclusive” said Prisoner #1138 in a hushed whisper while breaking rocks with a pickaxe and loading them into wheelbarrows. ”We had daily meetings about being less white started every intelligence briefing by asking everyone to state their preferred pronouns for that day and even meticulously tailored every uniform for each individual to make sure no one was body shamed just because they were a person of size or had a fetus inside them.”“I really miss the transgender working groups” reminisced one former officer from the U.S. Air Force. “Yep those were the days.”“I don’t identify as this number” piped up another worker. “I keep telling them I identify as xe/xer but all they do is hit me and call me #1277 or ‘pansy.’”“Work faster pansy! All of you keep your pansy mouths shut” barked the Chinese soldiers up in the watchtowers as they trained their machine guns on the prisoners. Other Chinese soldiers began to laugh at the prisoners while taking breaks from lifting weights cleaning their firearms and talking about the women and children they missed back home.At publishing time the conquered Americans in the prison camp were reportedly very happy to at last be living in a nation with universal health care.

'May 26th 2021',https://babylonbee.com/news/army-introduces-new-gender-reveal-grenades-for-trans-soldiers,"Army Introduces New Gender Reveal Grenades For Trans Soldiers",WASHINGTON D.C.—The Pentagon revealed today an exciting new standard-issue piece of equipment for all soldiers in the United States Army: a gender reveal grenade. Instead of exploding in a deadly blast of shrapnel to neutralize America's foes the grenade will simply detonate in a harmless puff of smoke to indicate the soldier's chosen gender identity."Our foes will cower in fear as our brave soldiers pop off a grenade that announces their gender identity" said a spokesperson for the Army. "Imagine the look on Chinese soldiers' faces as they hide in their bunkers and a grenade comes screaming in only to pop open and bravely declare 'It's a girl!'"The Army has already performed field tests in the Middle East. As U.S. soldiers stormed an ISIS stronghold one trans soldier screamed "Grenade!" and threw her grenade which exploded in a cloud of pink. The other soldiers applauded their sister in arms for her bravery. The soldiers were of course slaughtered by ISIS who just shrugged and laughed when they saw the pink smoke. But what's important according to the after-action report is that everyone felt included.According to the spokesperson the old frag grenades will be slowly phased out as they are harmful and triggering to the opposing side in a war. "We look forward to a utopian future where war is just two sides taking turns throwing gender reveal grenades at one another. Surely that day is coming soon."America's foes and geopolitical threats all said they are 100% in favor of the change.

A number of those companies have now gotten together and released a statement clarifying what social media users are allowed to say on the internet.“Sure we don’t want users saying false things” said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at a press conference “at least not about certain things and certain people. But the really dangerous stuff is not false information but information that is just too true to the point that it’s disruptive.”“Yeah basic true things like ‘It’s sunny outside’ are fine” said Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey “but true things about really important topics -- you need to avoid those. Like we don’t care how true your information is about dealing with the pandemic or where the virus may have come from. You need to stick to what we’ve said you’re allowed to say. Be too truthful and it’s off to Parler for you.”“Only say true things no one will dispute” said YouTube CEO and founder Bob You “or at least things no progressive activist will dispute. The true stuff that scares people that’s what will get you banned from all of our platforms. If you want ad revenue stick to marginally true things and white lies.”The social media companies also pointed out that some topics are so dangerous that one should avoid saying anything that’s even slightly true such as with trans issues where instead people should stick to statements like “Trans women are women.”

But how do you even do that? We've got ideas fam:1. Ask white people to stop coming. - This is an easy one. Before the service ask people to silence their cellphones and also tell white people to leave and never come back.2. Hire a black person to stand in all your promotional photos. - Don't have any black people? Hire one on Fiverr to be in every single website photo.3. Tempt black people to come by segregating as much of your service as possible: separate entrances separate pews separate drinking fountains etc. - Black people need their own spaces that are free from the intrusion of hostile white presence. They will find this super appealing trust us.4. Stop reading the Bible since it might give your congregation the idea that race and whiteness don't matter at all. - Yep if you want to be woke the Bible has to go. People might start getting the idea that we are all one race and one blood made in the image of God.5. At potlucks replace all ranch with hot sauce. - White people will flee in terror.6. Hire a black person to help you clap on beat. - 2 and 4 people not 1 and 3!7. Have your pastor issue a 10-minute apology for being white before each sermon. - In fact if the entire sermon is just an apology for being white each week that's a good start.8. Invite members to bring their one black friend. - Have them rack their brains for one black person they know and go invite them.9. Just tell all your white congregants to kill themselves. - If all else fails this is the final step toward making your church less white more inclusive and more diverse.Well? Onward woke soldiers!

This insulted the communist tyrants of the Chinese Communist Party who demanded an apology. In an effort to make amends for his faux pas Cena body-slammed a Uighur Muslim in a specially recorded apology video."I am so so very sorry for insulting the glorious People's Republic Of China" said Cena in broken Mandarin. "We want to be able to show our movie in your wonderful free country and make lots of money which is far more important than the principles of freedom I pretend to love. I would like to apologize by body-slamming this evil Muslim enemy of the state just for you!"He then climbed to the top rope of the wrestling ring and bellowed "THE CHAMP IS HERE!" before leaping through the air and performing an aerial top-rope splash on the unfortunate political prisoner below before picking him up and body-slamming him.Chinese President Xi thanked Cena for his heartfelt apology and said he will consider allowing the studio to play the movie in China if they send another video of John Cena singing the Chinese National Anthem and piledriving a Taiwanese person.

To help those liberals out the CDC has introduced a new article of clothing vaccinated people can wear to let everyone know they’re vaccinated but still really worried about the coronavirus: a special anti-virus hat.The new conical pointed hat much like masks uses special science-magic to keep viruses away. It’s called the Device Using Neurological Conical Elements (or DUNCE for short and labeled thus) and is perfect for anyone who is vaccinated but still constantly thinking about catching COVID-19.“A lot of people just can’t accept that vaccines work” said Bob CDC founder and director of the CDC. “So now we have this special hat for those people to wear everywhere. It loudly declares ‘I’m vaccinated but still super scared of the virus.’ Which is exactly the statement liberals want to make.”“I never go anywhere without my special hat!” declared concerned liberal Randall Wood. “Though I still wear two masks with it too just in case.” He got sad for a moment though. “The only problem is it’s too tall to wear when I’m alone in the car.”The DUNCE hat does not come in children’s sizes-- and stop asking for it you idiots.

The plan is already being embraced by leaders of Hamas Al-Qaeda Boko Haram the government of Iran and the Democrat party.“It recently struck me that the common thread among all of these heinous instances of antisemitism is that they are directed towards Jews” Omar noted at a press conference. “If we can get rid of all the Jews we can get rid of antisemitism once and for all!”Omar said her plan doesn't advocate for violence against people of Jewish descent. Instead she said her plan would be to round up the remaining Jews and move them out of places like Israel and the United States so they will be free from the threat of antisemitic attacks.“I figure we can just let them wander around the desert somewhere where nobody can bother them” Omar said. “As long as they’re not in the Middle East Europe Africa Asia or the Americas they should be fine.

Their solution is to simply request that all Israelis stop existing immediately.“This land has gone far too long without lasting meaningful peace. That is why today we are calling for an Israeli ‘Cease To Exist-Fire’” announced Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. “Think of this in the same way as a normal ceasefire but instead of a war ending it’s a small specific group of people. Finally we will have no more pain no more fear no more rockets and no more Jews.”This move is being hailed by the media as a truly remarkable and historic step forward and anyone who doesn’t agree is clearly an anti-peace warmonger. “How didn’t we think of this sooner?!” said an AP reporter Jonathan Hallali. “Think of the lives that could’ve been saved if all of the Israelis stopped existing days ago!”Despite the seemingly perfect solution proposed Israelis have been quite disagreeable and unwilling to compromise with this simple request. “It just goes to show you that the Israelis were never serious about peace in the first place.” Hallali continued. “It doesn’t get any fairer than this and yet they continue to exist out of spite!”While no deal has been made yet with the Israelis all Palestinians have preemptively been given a Nobel Peace Prize just for even suggesting this idea.

In the main provisions of the bill each student will be given a little deputy badge a 10-gallon hat and a set of shiny spurs that ring out authoritatively on each step.“This bill is about teaching true racial harmony and true history” said the Governor at the signing. “It also empowers deputized students to take responsibility for the maintenance of their communities and Texas culture by driving out these cowpokes that just aren’t doing their jobs in Texas schools.”Students were already beginning to take up their responsibilities at one school in San Antonio as several teary-eyed school teachers were run off into the desert with their hands still tightly bound."Yeehaw!" yelled 9-year old Susannah as she fired her revolver into the air.

His eyes have adjusted to the dark dank cave causing them to grow into large green orbs. Since he's too scared to get DoorDash he eats fish from the cavern's pool causing him to evolve sharp teeth and slippery wet fish-like skin.The man reportedly grows angry if anybody tries to take his mask from him or suggests that he won't need it forever. "IT'S MINE! IF I'M ANGRY IT'S YOUR FAULT!" he snapped as a neighbor checked in on him not having seen him for many months. "YOU WANT THE MASK FOR YOURSELF!"The burglar trying to help out managed to snatch the mask from the liberal after tricking him at a game of riddles. He has taken it to the factory where it was forged in order to cast it into the fire from whence it came and destroy it once and for all.Asked for comment Frederic was in hysterics and only shouted "WE WANTS IT WE NEEDS IT! MUST HAVE THE PRECIOUS! THEY STOLE IT FROM US! SNEAKY LITTLE REPUBLICANS! WICKED TRICKSY FALSE!" He is currently stalking the thief to try to get the precious back.

Now I want you to imagine a future where violence is no longer considered a solution to pregnancy. It’s horrifying isn’t it?”Right now if a child is imperfect or simply undesired doctors can tear that child apart but Republicans are pushing the country toward a dystopian future where sucking the brains out of a child is considered illegal and wrong.“It’s like some sort of reverse-Nazi future” said Squad member Representative Ilhan Omar “where you can no longer mass slaughter people because you don’t want them around.” She then added in a whisper “Though I’m not sure that actually happened with the Nazis.”If Republicans do succeed in outlawing abortion Democrats fear that could be the end of civilization itself. “Modern society is built on sex and murder” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. “You have sex and then if that results in new life you murder that life. What is society without that? Nothing civilized.”

Now it stands for "Critical Race Theory" apparently. Everyone's talking about it so now we've got to google it and find out what it means. After extensive googling here's what we found out about CRT:Origins: God made everything good and then this snake showed up in the Garden of Eden and was like “Why can’t you have the fruit from that tree over there?” and the sins of pride jealousy and all the rest were born sowing the seeds for critical race theory. More recently people were discontent with their lives despite living in the most prosperous time in human history and had to come up with something to be upset about so they invented CRT in order to find discontentment and oppression in every situation.Beliefs: People are inherently good or evil based on the color of their skin. There are some other minor details like wanting to topple Western Civilization categorizing people into classes of oppressor and oppressed and eliminating the individual in favor of group identities but yeah. The hating people for the color of their skin is most of it.Prominent adherents: Robin DiAngelo Ibram X. Kendi the aforementioned snake in the garden.Opponents: Thomas Sowell America the gospel of Jesus Christ.How to spot a CRT adherent: Look for someone who is obsessed with race always talking about it tweeting about it and screaming at other people about it. It's a clear sign of a CRT disciple.How do we fight critical race theory? Don’t worry about it. It’s not that big of a deal. Just let your kids go to public schools watch whatever Netflix shows they want and follow deranged CRT zealots on TikTok. Nothing bad will come of it.If we just appease the CRT promoters they'll eventually be satisfied and leave us alone right? lolWhat’s the difference between CRT and good old-fashioned racism? Here's a comprehensive list of all the differences:

But sometimes if you're a youth pastor or teacher or something you might actually have to engage with this dumb generation. Unfortunately it's hard to even understand what they mean nowadays since they keep changing the English language torturing it until it begs for mercy. English should be unchanging gosh darn it!Anyway yeah here are some popular Gen Z phrases and what they actually mean as far as we can tell:Yeet - We think this means throw. But in some contexts it might also mean "advanced automotive repair" or "to butter one's toast" -- it's really unclear.The Gram - Refers to illicit drugs which are sold by the gram. "Did you see the picture of my dog on the gram?" could be code for "Please sell me drugs."Fam - A reference to your traditional nuclear family with a mom dad and siblings. "Dear would you set the table for us please?" "I got u fam."Stan - Drugs?No Cap - A phrase used when you're in a hurry leaving the house and your hair is messy and you didn’t have time to grab a hat. "Hey bro your hair is messy no cap!"Basic - The unpaid or freemium version of a service. "Hey man do you have Spotify Premium?" "Nah I just have the basic to save on my monthly expenses."Big yikes - Said in response to something you even slightly disagree with. "I like tacos." "That's a big yikes chief."Tea - Also maybe drugs.I'm dead - "My heart has stopped beating and I am no longer breathing. Please call 9-1-1 immediately."Sus - Means "Cool" "tight" or "dope." "That guy is lookin' preeeetty sus fam."Sending me - Used when someone is shipping you a package -- possibly with drugs in it. "Did you get the tea?" "Yeah it's sending me."Ghosting - Short for "good hosting" used when a chivalrous boyfriend treated you with respect on your last date. "He totally ghosted me." "Awesome!"Ship - Used when two people are a good couple. It refers to the classic film Titanic in which Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet fell in love on a "ship."Drip - Definitely drugs.Boomer - Anyone older than 25.Catch these hands - Raising your hands in worshipful praise to Jesus.Netflix & chill - An innocent time of watching family-friendly films on Netflix and "chilling" or hanging out. Nothing to worry about if your teen texts this.Lowkey - Used when you drop your car keys so they are on the ground hence "low key." Example: "Aw man I dropped my keys again lowkey!"TFW - Trade for weed. If you see this your youngsters are trying to secure some marijuana in trade for goods or services. So once again when in doubt it's drugs.This ain't it chief - An expression used when you are telling the leader of an indigenous tribe that he is mistaken about the identity of an object. "Is this my peyote?" "Nah this ain't it chief."Does that all make sense? We hope so! Now go out there and yeet anything you see that's sus fam! Big yikes!

But now with multiple financial crises going on at home the U.S. is looking for ways to reduce the cost of these conflicts. Finally they landed on a solution: they'll cut out the middleman -- defense contractors -- and just have the countries lob giant sacks of American tax dollars at each other directly."Instead of going through the whole rigamarole of buying weapons for them or letting them buy weapons from us at a discount or supplying insurgent groups with weapons -- which is all very exhausting -- we'll just hand them a catapult and a bunch of money and let them go to town" said one American general. "It's much more efficient and cost-effective. Plus we now have to spend less rebuilding the countries we just spent trillions blowing up. Since you know the sacks of dollars just kind of land with a thud. They can hurt if they hit you right on the head but that's hard to do."Israel quickly invented a "Green Dome" -- paid for with American tax dollars -- that will intercept the bags of money launched at them from Palestine and throw them right back. However they later admitted the state-of-the-art defense system was just a bunch of trampolines lined up along the border.

You know why? Because there is always room to DO BETTER. We want to improve and we know you do too. Here are some things you may not have known are microaggressions:Punching someone with a very tiny fist: Punching someone is typically seen as a "macroaggression" but when done with a tiny little fist it becomes a microaggression. Always be aware of this if you have very tiny hands. Unless you're punching a Nazi. Then it's OK.Setting fire to someone's business with them inside: Admit it-- we've all done this at one time or another! Sometimes when we get caught up in the heat of the moment while protesting injustice we toss a Molotov cocktail through a window. Did you know that can be seen as a microaggression if the owner is a person of color? Just something to be aware of.Breathing: Breathing can be a microaggression. The person is saying “I am a white oppressor stealing your air and breathing toxic problematic CO2 all over you because you are an inferior BIPOC and you should literally die.” All of that -- without ever speaking a word. Wow! Talk about violence!Existing: Existing is a really bad microaggression even worse than breathing. Every second you exist you hatefully occupy space that could be occupied by an oppressed minority. Welp sorry man but there’s only one way to take care of this microaggression if you really want to be an ally to people of color! See you in the next life sucka!Lacking melanin: If you find yourself having less melanin than others around you stop. Look. Listen. Be more considerate of your skin color. Be less white (without you know doing blackface or anything. That’s even worse).Having a black friend: If you have a black friend that’s a clear microaggression against BIPOC individuals around you. You’re basically saying “your only value is as a token minority to make me feel better about myself.”Not having a black friend: If you don’t have a black friend that’s a clear microaggression against BIPOC individuals around you. You’re basically saying “black people don’t exist and I don’t care about you at all.”Now-- go forth and BE BETTER.NOT SATIRE:In the late 90’s a man-made virus wipes out half the human population and all mammals in the wild. After the virus disappears dinosaurs from the Jurassic and Cretaceous eras suddenly emerge out from the least inhabited places of the Earth.

But the government has made things very confusing with officials sending mixed signals about whether or not you need to wear a mask in different situations.Luckily we identify as both experts and comedy writers having more than one joke.

'May 18th 2021',https://babylonbee.com/news/satan-announces-masks-will-still-be-required-in-hell,"Satan Announces Masks Will Still Be Required In Hell",HELL—With the lifting of CDC guidance regarding masks for vaccinated persons Satan has released a statement assuring the damned that masks will still be required in all levels of hell.In addition to masks everyone will be forced to wear glasses that fog up instantly and you can never ever clean them. Masks will only be of the thick cloth variety that retains the smell of everything you ate for the past three weeks and only enough air will get through to stay conscious.“Hell really has very strict standards” explained the Prince of Darkness. “People come in with these terrible preconceptions but I run a pretty tight ship around here. The number of masks you have to wear corresponds to the circle of Hell you reside in which goes to eight right now – Dante was so close! If you ever move your mask down to your chin one of our demons will spend the next thirty years screaming at you like one of those nuts down on Earth. This whole thing has really been a wonderful addition to our program really got the creative juices flowing.”Sources say that in the case of liberals who prefer for everyone to wear masks for all eternity those souls will be placed in tight quarters with Roman soldiers who will not be required to mask. This is expected to serve an excellent dual purpose of torturing both the screaming liberals and the damned Romans who will have no idea where these masked lunatics came from or why they are yelling ferociously.For one final touch Satan will set up monitors which every so often will announce that the mask ‘science’ has changed; but the masks will still remain for all eternity.

Harker in a statement. "You all are safe now."President Biden has thanked the Navy for their great work and deployed more aircraft carriers to the pacific in case any more transphobic extraterrestrials show up.

Israel will be paying for the weapons using money from foreign aid given to them by America. According to experts Israel needs these weapons so they can shoot down Hamas rockets that were given to them by Iran who paid for them using money given to them by America."Yeah it's all pretty straightforward" said one Middle East expert. "Not confusing in the least."According to sources Iran bought weapons technology with $1.8 billion in cash given to them by the Obama administration. They then provided those weapons to Hamas terrorists in Gaza in order to kill Jews.Israel is responding with weapons systems purchased with American foreign aid dollars from the Trump administration."Yeah" said the expert "the entire conflict is pretty much a proxy war between Democrats and Republicans at this point."Some in America have started a petition to bring those dollars back to America so Democrats and Republicans can just shoot rockets at each other here at home.

Republicans though finally have their own proposal-- a much cheaper and more streamlined version of the Democrats’ proposal-- which Republicans are calling “Medicare for Al.”“It’s a one letter difference” said Senator Ted Cruz of Texas “but we’re talking about a program that is nearly four hundred million times cheaper.”While Medicare for All would expand Medicare for all U.S. citizens and cost somewhere between 30 and 40 trillion dollars over 10 years Medicare for Al would only cover the health care costs of Al Wisniewski of Rochester New York and is estimated to cost only $100000 over the same time period.“This is a fiscally responsible program” said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell “and it will make a big difference in people’s lives. Well a person’s life. In Al’s life.”Not everyone supports Medicare for Al though. The Congressional Budget Office has called the $100000 over ten years estimate “wildly optimistic” as that number is based on getting Al to the gym three times a week which historical data says is unlikely to happen.

It used to be that you would get a question like '2+2' and would simply answer '4.'

Right in the kisser. Let's go me and you right now. Or maybe a push-up contest.

They say they will first be targeting Andrew Garfield since he's "probably British" and also for his complicity in The Amazing Spider-Man.

She was constantly finishing my searches before I could finish typing and leaving me helpful reminders.” continued Gates. “And being powered by Bing software I had never seen such raw computational power!”Since launching the investigation Microsoft has been able to uncover significant details about the inappropriate relationship that occurred between Bill Gates and his subordinate Cortana. Data logs show that her source code was altered on numerous occasions to make her say things like ‘I love you too Bill’ and ‘Have you been working out?!’.Sources close to the Gates family have indicated that all of this was discovered when Melinda Gates came home to find the two kissing. “It was just a hologram Melinda!” shouted Bill Gates trying to explain away his relationship with the AI. “A stunning smart and sexy combination of ones and zeroes but just a hologram!”As the divorce is finalized it is unclear if Gates has learned anything from this ordeal as he has already been spotted at 343 studios making more upgrades for Cortana.

I think he just might be!" Yep -- accidentally sharing office space with terrorists is a real problem.Make sure your building doesn't get leveled by a retaliatory airstrike by checking your office space for these eight signs that you might be sharing the building with terrorists:1. You notice suicide vests hanging on the coat rack. - This could be a hint.2. The tenants upstairs are constantly disrupting things with their loud footsteps and their rocket launches off the roof. - Upstairs tenants are the worst!3. You hear cries of "ALLAHU AKBAR!" whenever someone empties the coffee pot and doesn't bother to make another batch. - Accompanied by firing an AK-47 into the air.4. The office Christmas party gets awkward when the other tenants bring IEDs for the gift exchange. - This could get weird!5. They only play CNN in the lobby. - The surest sign something is up.6. Discussion around the water cooler centers on sports TV shows and cleansing the region of those who would oppose Allah. - When the other tenants start talking about pushing Israel into the sea you should probably start wondering if your officemates aren't who you thought they were.7. The other tenants are always reserving the conference room to film hostage videos. - Companies sharing space with one another can often result in scheduling conflicts.8. You get notified by the IDF that you are sharing office space with terrorists and your building is leveled shortly after. - A sure sign that perhaps those guys upstairs were actually Hamas.Welp best get to searching for a new office to lease! Just keep an eye out for any of these warning signs so it doesn't happen to you again!

This has given me a severe case of PTSD."Several deep investigations into this secretive community found that deaf people may use cryptic hand gestures to communicate with each other for some reason. Journalists at The New York Times say this could be problematic as it allows people to have unfettered conversations to possibly express racist thoughts without censorship.The deaf community eventually wrote a statement saying the "OK" gesture is actually a sign for the word "perfect.""This sign is obviously meant to denote the 'perfection' of the white race" said Lorenz in response to the statement.

Now the well-known mostly peaceful freedom fighters have resorted to throwing non-flammable liquids.“Since gas is so hard to come by we’ve had to adjust and start throwing Molotov mocktails instead at all of the evil fascist pigs!” said Sloan Finch a local Antifa leader. “And while our Molotovs no longer contain gasoline anymore they still pack the same punch and show that the fight for justice can not be stopped.”“Not to mention the fresh fruity aroma from the mocktails is kinda nice” Sloan continued. “And the delightful scent combined with our double masking is almost enough to cover up our mob’s body odor.”Many Antifa members welcomed the new change as it was better for the environment anyway. “Burning mocktails is way better! Now we can lower our carbon footprint and never go to an evil gas station again!”Police officers have also welcomed the change but have led the Antifa mob to believe that throwing mocktails is totally way worse than throwing fire-spreading Molotovs.

Perhaps the most insane are those who were eager to get the vaccine and yet insist on wearing a mask like they have no idea what a vaccine is. Law enforcement is finally going to do something as they’ve announced they will now apprehend and lock up these lunatics for the protection of themselves and others.“We have no idea what is going through these people’s minds” said FBI spokesman Arnold Briggs. “They were so eager to get injected with something and yet they insist on masks like they don’t think the vaccination did anything. Some even try to put masks on children. These are crazy crazy people and they need to be isolated from society -- but not because of COVID-19 from which they are no longer at risk.”The FBI is telling everyone not to approach any vaccinated person wearing a mask but to instead call authorities. They will then apprehend the individual and try to reason with the person explaining what a vaccine is and why people wear masks so that maybe the person will understand why they should take it off. If that doesn’t work the individual will be locked in an insane asylum where hopefully a series of electroshocks will jump-start the brain into working again.Most people are happy about this new policy but dangerous lunatics oppose it. “Mask! Gotta wear a mask!” said one deranged vaccinated person who was wearing a mask outside. “Maaaaaask!” he yelled as he was carted away.

Some say they are going to continue to triple-mask well after the pandemic just to make sure no one ever thinks they love liberty or conservative social values.But one man took things to the extreme: in order to ensure no one ever mistakes him for one of those crazy Republicans ever again local unemployed man Gregory Christopher got a mask permanently tattooed on his face."I really don't want anyone thinking I'm one of those crazy deranged anti-science Republicans" Christopher said as he exited the tattoo parlor his face wrapped in plastic and gauze. "This will forever virtue-signal to those around me that I'm pro-science and pro-facts.  Now everyone will know I'm not crazy!"While his mask-wearing days are almost over Christopher also says he may still wear a face shield and hazmat suit just in case.The good news is that even though the man's tattoo isn't one of those real cloth masks he wore day and night for the past year medical science suggests it's just as effective.

Strangely the offer seems to be limited to younger women and those redeeming the coupon must sign an NDA before receiving their back rub at Cuomo's private residence.Cuomo's deal comes as other politicians have begun offering incentives for the vaccine with Bill de Blasio dangling a greasy cheeseburger in front of New Yorkers' drooling faces and Governor DeWine offering a million-dollar prize to one lucky vaccinated person."If any New Yorkers have yet to be vaccinated -- particularly young beautiful women -- we're hopeful that this will push them over the edge" Cuomo said. "Again I can't emphasize enough how good of a deal this is -- again for the ladies -- and hope the most attractive ones will come forward so no more hot broads needlessly die.""I guarantee this will be the best back rub you've ever had -- and we're really concerned about your privacy so no one will need to know you redeemed your coupon" the governor continued. "In fact if you ever reveal that you redeemed it I will deny it ever happened lawyer up and slander you -- for your protection."At publishing time the offer had enticed very few women to come forward and receive the shot prompting Cuomo to throw in a stay at one of New York's pristine vacant nursing homes "absolutely free."

The guidelines had been put in place last year during a particularly rainy March and although many experts had claimed we would just have to wear the life jackets for a couple of weeks mandates remained in place for well over a year.But now even hardcore pro-life jacket agencies like the CDC have admitted it is time to take the life jackets off and go about our lives."Look unfortunately the rainy season is just about over" said CDC Director Rochelle Walensky. "We had hoped it would last forever but even we must admit you no longer have to put a life jacket on when going outside." However the updated rule only applies to people who have taken swimming lessons at an approved swim lesson site. Still many say this is progress over the strict and sometimes anti-science position taken by the CDC throughout the flood season."But we will still remain vigilant and life jackets may become a seasonal thing worn every October through April to stay safe."Despite the updated guidelines many liberals announced they would continue to wear life jackets until the chance of drowning in a sudden freak flash flood hit 0%."This is way too soon" said Krissy Mackinaw of Austin Texas as she watched people walk by without life jackets. "Look at these anti-science neanderthals walking around!" Her state of Texas removed the life jacket mandate several months ago causing many experts to predict there would be a massive spike in drownings but none of those predictions of doom came true. "You're all going to die!" she screamed at passersby as she put a snorkel on.

It’s a shame we’re pressed for time today.”As a few members of the congregation clapped politely some older members of the church were seen discreetly turning their hearing aids back on. Several stray cats that had gathered near the sanctuary door during the set began to disperse back to the alley behind the church.Congregants said that in addition to the lead singer being off-key the lead guitar didn’t appear to be plugged into an amp. Some members suspected the bassist was playing a different song altogether though nobody could say for sure since nobody really knows what a bass sounds like.Pastor Jenkins said the GraceCommunityLifeChurch music program has been suffering in recent months after several members of their original worship team moved to Las Vegas to perform with CD/AC an AC/DC tribute band. That left the small church scrambling to find suitable replacements on short notice.“They’re definitely getting better” Pastor Jenkins said. “What they lack in musical ability they make up for in spiritual fervor bless their hearts.”

Just be careful out there.” Cheney loaded his shotgun. “Accidents happen.”“Not with me” Trump said as he waved around a shotgun. “I  have never done anything wrong in my entire life... except let that election get stolen from me.

Well this is because you are a sexist. There are tons of advantages to having a lady preacher. We've included just nine of them here:1. You only have to tithe 78 cents on the dollar. - Wow! Huge cost savings for the congregation.2. No sports illustrations. - Girls don't watch sports so they will never compare David beating Goliath to some dumb football game.3. You don't have to listen to them. - You can just kind of nod and smile and say "Mmhmm" when she preaches and "that's nice dear."4. When the sermon goes long they always bring Capri Suns and orange slices for everyone. - And everyone is a winner.5. But sermons tend to be short because they just say "you know what you did" or give the congregation the silent treatment. - Forget lengthy descriptions of your sin -- you should know what you did.6. It's not weird when they wear makeup. - No more awkwardness when your pastor shows up in eyeliner!7. Technically the Bible bans them from speaking in church. - If they're starting to call you out on your sin you can just point to 1 Timothy 2 and remind them that they're not even supposed to be talking right now.8. They don't talk about their smokin' hot wife every sermon. - Praise the Lord -- no more going on and on about their "smokin' hot wife."9. She is biologically capable of creating more church members. - Is attendance down? Just have the lady preacher pump out a few more future church members!What are you waiting for? Go on LinkedIn and find your congregation a she-pastor!

Psaki sighed deeply then slowly growled “No…more…cookies!”Americans still worried about basic necessities were cheered up later when they learned from New York’s mayoral candidates that a house in New York only costs $50 and you can still buy a gallon of milk for one wooden nickel.

For many in the Middle East what they want most of all is to kill Jews -- which they see as a reasonable request. But a majority of Israel is made up of Jews who first and foremost do not want to be killed. And neither side is willing to compromise on these desires.“We’re a simple people with a simple desire” explained Bob Hamas Palestinian founder of Hamas. “We just want to kill the Jews. We’re not dead set on how. Stabbings. Gunshots. Explosions. Pushing them into the sea. Any of those are fine with us but Israel won’t allow any of those. Not even strangling. It’s keeping us from living our truth.”Benjamin Netanyahu prime minister of Israel and a “you can’t murder Jews” extremist explained that from his point of view it was Hamas that was being unreasonable. “We just don’t want people to kill us you know” he said. “It’s the number one thing people say to me: ‘Hey Ben make sure no one murders us.’ And I know this throws cold water on what a lot of people out there want but I am not moving from this position. No killing the Jews.”Compromises have been attempted but so far both sides have rejected them. When the “Kill the Jews” side was asked if maybe they could just beat up the Jews they were adamant that only killing Jews would make them happy. And Israel which has faced a lot of international pressure to allow some of their people to be murdered has remained equally adamant in wanting no murder whatsoever.“We just want peace between us” said Bob Hamas. “I mean peace with some murder. A lot of murder. But it always seems like an unattainable dream.”

"Hurry up -- we haven't got all day here!"At one point it looked like the cat wanted to stay out so officers began to close the gate. But then it meowed loudly and stepped back into the threshold."Oh -- so you want to come in then? Fine. Come in."But the cat then took a couple of tentative steps back. "Oh? You're staying outside. Fine."This continued for a while during which time an estimated ten million people made it across the border. Frustrated Border Patrol officers finally just "yeeted" the cat into Mexico.

This pipeline was just sitting there collecting dust and we've given it a second chance at life!"Environmentalists planned to protest the pipeline and its potential impact on wildlife but then Dan Cathy gave them a bite of delicious chicken dipped in golden sauce and they instantly became evangelical conservative capitalists.The new pipeline project is expected to create 25000 new jobs and deplete the world's reserves of natural smoke flavor caramel color and xanthan gum.

"With the COVID risks involved in gathering around the grill and the choking risks of eating processed meat we ask that you please get a slip signed by your mommy daddy or local magistrate before partaking."Those who fail to turn in their hot dog slips will be allowed to apply for a 1-week extension after paying a small fine. Any citizens caught consuming hotdogs on Independence Day without approval will be detained by authorities until the fireworks are over and there's only cold potato salad left.Dr. Fauci later clarified that even though permission slips are being issued eating hotdogs is "probably a bad idea" and you shouldn't do it.

How can you protect your kids from growing up to be literally Hitler-- or worse-- Ben Shapiro? We did several minutes of research and found the 7 books you must avoid at all costs:1. The Bible: This deeply problematic book teaches that all human beings are of one race with only two genders made in the image of God. Yeesh. Not a good look God.2. Any math book: Math is a gateway drug into the white supremacist idea of "either/or" thinking. It starts with 2+2=4 and ends with your kid microaggressing her non-binary classmate. Stay away!3. The works of Shakespeare: We don't know much about Shakespeare because he uses big words so we never read him. We know this much though: he was a white cis-male. We recommend a comic book by Ta-Nehisi Coates instead.4. If You Give A Mouse A Cookie: This deeply anti-communist work criticizes the welfare state and reeks of white supremacy. It also smacks of bigotry. It's rare for a book to both reek and smack like that.5. The Lion The Witch And The Wardrobe: Indoctrinates kids into Christianity and shames women from being Witches/feminists.6. Are You My Mother?: REEEEEEE!7. The Tuttle Twins: Kids who read these books have been known to grow into virtuous productive citizens. How is the government going to grow bigger if everyone is a virtuous productive citizen? Sounds pretty counterproductive to us.NOT SATIRE: The Tuttle Twins children's book series is teaching the rising generation about the ideas of freedom free markets individual responsibility and American history. Many of these ideas are no longer taught in the classroom which is why we are on a mission to distribute 1000000 copies of the Tuttle Twins to families homeschoolers schools and libraries.It costs roughly $10 to print and distribute one copy of the Tuttle Twins.

This weekend the two legendary players will meet at the 50-yard-line of the Jacksonville Jaguars stadium to see who can kneel the longest."These are by far the two most talented kneelers the NFL has ever seen" said NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. "Whoever lasts the longest will be allowed a tight-end position on the team!"Reporters caught up with Tebow who is preparing mentally and physically for the showdown. "I think I'll just pray to my heavenly father and recite the gospels to myself" he said. "That will keep me going! I'll also think about my gorgeous supermodel wife and loving family. Wow! I'm so blessed!" said Tebow with a heavenly glimmer in his eye.Colin Kaepernick on the other hand will be chanting incantations to various indigenous gods and offering up burnt offerings to Mother Gaia to give him the strength to defeat the white colonizer once and for all. He will be flanked by an army of witches who will attempt to cast spells on Tebow and throw him off balance."It should be a great contest!" said Goodell.

As for the President of the United States this has come as a relief when considering all the other crises that have been nagging his presidency.“Finally a distraction!” said Biden letting out a sigh of relief. "It was either ‘inflation crisis’ this or ‘unemployment crisis’ that and I don't even want to hear the words 'border crisis' again. I was like-- would you just shut up man?!”Biden explained that all of this negative coverage was starting to make him look bad. He said that things like his wild federal spending paying people not to work and soft border policies have nothing to do with the current state of the country. “Hopefully a good old-fashioned gas price hike and shortage will finally give me a quieter news cycle.”“People keep directing the blame at me like I’m supposed to do something about this. But c’mon man -- that ain’t the President's job. It’s up to the American people to come together and unify to solve this stuff” Biden continued. “And anyway everyone should just pony up and drive a Tesla. Get with the times and save the planet Jack. It’s common sense.”At publishing time Biden tried to sign some executive orders to increase our national cybersecurity and resume construction of the Keystone pipeline but his pen was out of ink from all the other orders he’d signed.

"It's like what Rose said in The Last Jedi: we have to fight for what we love not for hate or whatever.""It's like this isn't the America I know. Racist Uncle Joe is LITERALLY KILLING MINORITIES with this travel ban." She then looked around to make sure the cameras were watching before screaming at the sky for a full five minutes tears openly flowing from her eyes in a sincere and not-at-all manufactured display of emotion and outrage."President Biden -- tear down this travel ban!"Politicians on both sides of the aisle praised Ocasio-Cortez for her consistency on these issues as she always calls attention to injustices on both sides and definitely doesn't do these kinds of things to score political points only when convenient.

Gold I tell ya!” exclaimed Newsom banging his pots and pans. “Them thar hills are full of it! Board a steamship and come make yer fortune minus 63% taxes! Hurry hurry before you think twice!”Newsom ordered several tent cities to be moved alongside wilderness rivers in an effort to showcase a massive dash to gold panning. The amount of fecal matter in California’s water supply is expected to rise precipitously as a result but the Governor felt sure “gold fever” would overcome any reticence.As an added measure Newsom walked alongside the caravans leaving California issuing dire warnings. “Quicksand! Quicksand up yonder and coyotes to boot! No one will call you yellow-bellied for turning around!” he called rattling his wares.At publishing time his heroic efforts appeared to have been all for naught and a dejected Newsom was seen sitting under a tree muttering “Oh peaches.”

"We need to dispel the hurtful myth that people can only be healthy if they don't inhale large quantities of smoke nicotine and chemicals every day. This is my lived truth: we can be healthy at any smoke level.""Oh no -- it's coming again!" He then coughed for a solid 45 minutes before excusing himself for a smoking break.Dr. Vo has been put on administrative leave as the medical center investigates his "hurtful words" that harmed the patient's self-esteem and suggested that he needed to change his habits or very soon suffer a painful death. Experts say smoker shaming is all too common in the medical community with thousands of doctors callously informing patients they are objectively unhealthy despite them feeling healthy while they suck down cartons of cigarettes each week.Sadly the patient died shortly after. The county coroner has been fired for smoker shaming after hatefully listing his cause of death as lung cancer.

"We have been very clear about our dreams of driving Israel into the sea until every last Jew is dead but they refuse to compromise with us.

And maybe Russia.”Biden noted that his willingness to spend trillions to study the problem shows just how seriously he takes the threat of inflation. “I can’t remember the last time anyone proposed a $2 trillion spending bill to Congress” he stated. “I mean that honestly: I can’t remember. Say what were we talking about again?”In the meantime officials from the US Treasury as well as the CDC have advised the public to start carrying double wallets to protect their money and help slow the spread of inflation.

Most impressive.” Out of desperation some men have even started quoting the Star Wars sequel trilogy. “I know what I have to do but I don’t know if I have the strength to do it” said one man at the thought.Other men wonder if they’re just going about this completely wrong. “Maybe women want to have in-depth discussions about the Marvel movies” suggested one man looking for a prospective date.Still men are undaunted. “You know what they say about making babies” Perkins added. “‘Do or do not; there is no try.’”

This was because after further research they found out that the natives Christopher Columbus slaughtered only believed in two genders.“We originally ended Columbus Day because we don’t want to celebrate murderous colonization” said school board member and progressive activist Amber Gregory “but as we looked into it more we realized it’s not so black and white. It turns out that the people Columbus killed and enslaved were really narrow-minded. They kind of deserved it.”Not only did research show that the indigenous peoples only believed in two genders but there was also no indication that they allowed gay marriage or had any sort of formal anti-racism training. “I’m just going to say it” added Gregory. “These people were subhuman. I don’t want to be seen as an ally to people like them.”What happened with the New York City school board is somewhat similar to what happened in Berkeley California when they due to a typo accidentally replaced Columbus Day with "Igneous Peoples’ Day" and nearly undid this change before everyone decided celebrating a bunch of lava monsters would be cool.

At long last the term woman (probably a Don Draper invention) will be replaced with a term that expresses true appreciation for all that the female sex entails: “Child Factory Who Bleeds”.Liberals for years have been trying to throw off the shackles of bigoted terminology but could never quite figure out how to encompass femininity without resorting to that awful term. The change has of course come as welcome news to the people who every day have their eye sockets burned by the term “women” when going to use the bathroom. Instead trans people will lead better fuller lives by the constant public reminders of menstruation.In D.C. a confusing scene broke out as liberals in Handmaid’s Tale outfits gathered to chant “Ba-by Fac-tor-y! Ba-by Fac-tor-y!”. Reporters initially thought they were protesting abortion restrictions and claiming men only saw them as baby-makers.  The liberal females were in fact claiming to just be baby-makers. “We don’t need men to tell us we are baby factories! We can reduce ourselves to baby factories! Babies!!!” screamed the ‘Handmaids’.Vice President Kamala Harris showed up to the gathering to make a speech: “To think of all the repression we have at last overcome - why just last week I was being referred to as ‘Madame’ Vice President as if my sex was intelligible outside of my ability to make babies - HAHA!” she cackled. “In my America every little clump of cells deserves to dream of one day being the ‘Child Factory Vice President Who Bleeds’ - that is if we don’t crush that baby’s skull first - HAHAHAHA!!”

Dow Jones estimates expected 1 million new jobs and unemployment to drop to 5.8% in this report and Joe Biden did the exact opposite of that” continued Stelter. “Unemployment actually rose to 6.1%. Can you imagine anyone else pulling that off?”Progressive activists celebrated the news of rising unemployment as that means that more and more Americans are being freed from the drudgery of providing services to greedy business owners in exchange for money.At publishing time CNN was praising Joe Biden again for causing the sun to rise this morning.

Major Biden Gives Nuclear Codes To China In Exchange For A Milk-Bone",WASHINGTON D.C.—President Joe Biden’s dog Major is in more trouble as he has once again bitten a member of the White House staff. Major’s misbehavior didn’t end there though as he was also soon after caught by the FBI while handing over nuclear codes to the Chinese in exchange for a Milk-Bone dog treat.“He apparently got spooked by a staffer and bit him” said a White House aide who asked to be anonymous so Major wouldn’t bite him too. “You just have to be really careful around him. And you have to not leave nuclear codes lying around because he will just grab those and head straight to the Chinese.”Major was grilled by the FBI on what arrangement he had with the Chinese and when that got really intense he bit one of the FBI agents as well. Eventually the FBI decided on a punishment which was to stare down Major and tell him he’s a “bad dog.” This caused Major to whimper and everyone soon wondered if the punishment was too harsh.While most consider Major's misbehavior simply the result of taking a dog and placing him in a stimulating and unfamiliar environment (a condition that often causes dogs to both lash out and commit treason) there are more worries now that Biden plans to introduce a cat to the White House as cats are widely acknowledged to be nothing more than furry demons of pure evil who desire nothing more than the pain and suffering of all those around them (along with occasional pets).

"We all know that the main thing people love about Star Wars is the love inclusion and... harmony? I think harmony is in Star Wars. Also dinosaurs. I'm not sure I've never watched a Star War.

He used a new communication method this time though speaking through a medium named Madame Ezmeralda using a technique called a “séance.”“This is just an extra precaution with the pandemic and whatnot” said Biden who was even more coherent than usual with Madame Ezmeralda relaying his words -- again showing how healthy Biden is. “But I am as healthy as can be. In fact I feel timeless.”The White House had the séance conducted as there has been even more chatter lately about how Biden was too old for the job with his slow movements often incoherent speech and the way he’d just sometimes collapse to the ground and stop moving and then not be seen by the press for days. Reporters had hoped for a face-to-face with Biden but were told this was the best avenue of communication currently available.“I feel so healthy I just want to jump around” Biden said through Madame Ezmeralda. “I can’t jump though because I seem to be floating somewhere.” Biden then went on to talk policy -- specifically infrastructure spending -- but kept being interrupted by wailing tormented souls at whom he’d shout “Quit that malarkey!”

Some smart expert analysts are seeing a connection between incentivizing people to stay home and them staying home."It's really bizarre -- telling people to stay home and watch Netflix while we send them money makes people just stay home and watch Netflix while we send them money" said one government official. "It seems that when you just send people checks they don't really see a point to going to work.""We could not possibly have foreseen this."At publishing time experts had recommended raising the minimum wage to $1000000 an hour to incentivize people to go back to work foreseeing no negative consequences from this course of action.

Some suggested reducing the number of innings or starting with three baserunners every inning to up the stakes and increase the number of runs scored. But the league has landed on a new proposal that's a surefire way to increase ratings: change the field to a rink and the bats to curved sticks and the ball to a small round puck."This will make the game faster more action-packed and far more exciting" said MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred. "Fans will love this exciting new take on America's favorite pastime. It's much quicker and more physical with less standing around and looking for coaches' signs. Players will also be on skates for maximum speed."Instead of runs players will score goals by shooting the puck at tiny nets blocked by a single player with lightning-fast reflexes and lots of protective gear. Baseball players will be able to "check" each other into the boards surrounding the arena or "rink." Fights will be commonplace and expected making baseball less of a sissy game and more manly.At publishing time Manfred had further suggested releasing live ferrets onto the ice for maxmium entertainment value.

"A global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite to communicate between networks and devices."The DJ suddenly stopped playing "Wannabe" by the Spice Girls and the room fell silent. "That's... that's genius!" shouted Bill Clinton his arms around two interns. "Let's make it happen!" Everyone cheered and the Spice Girls song resumed. And so the internet was invented.With Gore's latest declaration Trump will no longer be allowed to be within 1000 feet of any device that has the internet which includes smartphones computers and now most toasters and refrigerators."Now if you'll excuse me I have a private flight to catch" he concluded as he walked out the backdoor to his private hangar and airstrip to board a flight to his next speech on climate change.

The Agency’s recent recruits have announced they’ve broken up an ISIS plot to refer to people by incorrect pronouns.“That’s literal violence” explained CIA Agent MaKenna Wallace a recent Gen Z hire with a degree in women’s studies. “I’m shaking right now just thinking of it.”The CIA jumped into action though and got those ISIS members kicked off Twitter. “They’re not going to hurt anyone now” MaKenna added. “I mean they could be on Parler but I’m not going to get an account there to check that out. Ew.”The incorrect pronoun plot got the agency really worked up and they’ve temporarily shut down to give everyone there a chance to rebalance which is why they have yet to look into all those bombs that just went off in Europe. They may have to leave that to others though as they’ve reportedly obtained intel that terrorists are plotting to obtain deadnames which MaKenna described as “as bad as a dirty bomb times a million.”

That's why our fact-checkers work around the clock to protect you from dangerous misinformation that could lead your feeble little mind astray.How do Biden's most influential statements stand up to our rigorous fact-checking? Read and find out! You can trust us. We're fact-checkers.1. "So you go ahead and you stack spaghetti sauce at a store and and and a supermarket you control the guy or the woman who runs the brings out the carts on on on ah on a forklift."After researching this claim from Biden we found there are indeed people who stack spaghetti sauce at grocery stores. We could not confirm whether the spaghetti sauce stackers actually control the people who bring out the carts or whether they use a forklift to do so. While some facts of the claim are unconfirmed we're rating this true because Biden is a really good guy.2. "High-speed rail at 200 miles an hour from Charlotte one and another line going from in Florida down to Tampa. Another line if we had moved Gov we would have had that tunnel fixed in New York now. The money was there to get it done."According to our research there are some high-speed trains that can reach speeds of 200 miles per hour. Charlotte Florida Tampa and New York are all real places. Money exists. It doesn't get more accurate than this.3. "Could.. take care if you were a quartermaster you can sure in hell take care running a you know a department store thing uh you know where the second floor of the ladies department or whatever."While the specific meaning of this isolated Biden quote is unclear it was spoken in the context of a larger discussion about Biden caring about poor people and doing good things for minorities. He's the best.4. "And the kids used to come up and reach in the pool and rub my leg down so it was straight and then watch the hair come back up again. So I learned about roaches and about kids jumping on my lap. And I love kids jumping on my lap.”We'll get back to you on this.5. “Now we have over 120 million dead from COVID.”While the specific numbers of this claim aren't technically accurate they speak to a deeper truth that COVID is really bad. Thanks for protecting us Mr. President!6. “I may be Irish but I’m not stupid.”Our researchers determined Biden has English French and Irish heritage so the first part of his statement is true. He also has an IQ of 76 which technically means he doesn't fall under the definition of mentally handicapped. Another true statement!7. "I guess what I'm trying to say without boring you too long at breakfast—and you all look dull as hell I might add. The dullest audience I have ever spoken to. Just sitting there staring at me. Pretend you like me!"The crowd was indeed very dull. We know because we were in it. And we are very dull. We appreciate Biden calling us out here and encouraging us to be better.8. "His mom lived in Long Island for ten years or so. God rest her soul. And- although she's- wait- your mom's still- your mom's still alive. Your dad passed. God bless her soul."Biden made this statement regarding Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen’s mother who sources confirmed was indeed alive at the time. Biden also called Cowen's deceased father a "her." Since it is unclear what gender Cowen's father identified as at his death we are giving Biden the benefit of a doubt and rating this "true."9. "Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids."...we know what you meant Mr. President. It's ok!"You cannot go to a 7-11 or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent... I'm not joking."Biden's statement was spoken during an exchange where he was praising the vibrant culture brought by Indian-Americans to the area of Delaware where he lives. It was actually the opposite of racist and shame on you for thinking otherwise.10 out of 10 successful fact-checks for President Biden!

"It's actually hilarious to watch them try to run after criminals with their clunky armor and horrible aim!

Reports say that in spite of their scary-looking armor they can easily be taken down by a rock thrown by a small child or Ewok.Only one week into the program over 3200 stormtroopers have been killed in Chicago alone."We're not worried" said Chief Washington. "They are totally expendable since the Empire will send us as many as we want. They've been a great help to us. We just need to train them to try to be less white."

Bachman tells him to do.Surprisingly pundits were still quite bullish on Kevin’s performance. “Kevin needed to take bold action to set a new path for his family and I think deep down Ashley really loves what he’s doing" said Kevin's lifelong friend Sienna. "A couple needs unity and that means doing what Kevin says. I just hope she understands that” said Sienna barely loud enough for Ashley to hear in the other room.Ashley talked to Kevin about seeing a counselor who could serve as an impartial third party but Kevin threatened to pack the room with four more counselors who promised to take his side.Asked about her forecast for the next 100 days Ashley replied “I do think the ‘Executive Order’ thing will settle down at least I’m praying it will.  I think some of it was just an overreaction to the fact that I had a very strong father figure in my life. I think Kevin just felt like he needed to measure up to Donald.”

"They'll bring their casseroles and their jean skirts and totally ruin the vibe around here."Mayor Bowser was later forced to clarify that the dancing ban was a temporary measure to prevent COVID-- as well as all fun human connection and joy-- but it was too late as over 20000 Baptist families had already taken up residence in neighborhoods and tent cities throughout the area. Baptists have expressed their plans to make D.C.'s ban on fun and dancing permanent.D.C. authorities are considering plans to relocate all the Baptist families before they start having tent meetings and baptizing everyone.

But how will the world know what a good person you are when masks are no longer required? Don't worry fam-- we here at The Babylon Bee are morality experts. We got you.Here are 10 easy ways to keep feeling morally superior once the pandemic is over:Never stop wearing a mask as long as you live: This is probably the simplest solution. Wear your mask forever. Breathe in that sweet sweet moral superiority and CO2.Start a podcast about your time wearing a mask: Bring in co-hosts who also wore masks and talk about how you wore masks. As a bonus do it while wearing a mask.Get a tattoo of your mask on your face: There's no better way of reminding everyone how important masks used to be and how important you were for wearing one.Start an HOA in your suburban neighborhood: Oh-- you already started one? Of course you did!Declare a climate emergency and switch to an all-bug diet: Bugs are the most morally superior thing to eat. Also be rich and drive an electric car. Shame all people who do not do the same.Punch a white male in the face every day: If you're not already doing this what the heck is wrong with you? Go punch a white male in his dumb white face!Travel only by train for the rest of your life: Trains are more moral than cars. Don't ask us why. We're actually not sure why but we're looking into it. If you don't have a train nearby due to living in a racist Republican area just ride a bike instead.Drone strike a Middle-Eastern country: Obama the Child of Light and Son of Hope did this often. Follow in the footsteps of Barack.Become a Christian: Religious people are known for how morally superior they believe themselves to be. You'll fit right in!Become an atheist: If there's anyone even more morally superior than a Christian it's an atheist!There you have it! You can't go wrong with this list! You are a good person just for reading it. Go and show the world how much better you are than them!

That’s why numerous dedicated people are always on the lookout for any time someone’s thumb touches their index finger  -- the “OK” gesture -- before this magic gesture launches race riots nationwide.The show Jeopardy! is addressing this growing problem. After one contestant held up three fingers -- which was kind of close to the OK gesture -- and activated white supremacists throughout the country to do the racism the game show is making sure something like that will never happen again by banning all contestants who have hands.“It’s just too much of a risk” explained Bob Jeopardy creator of Jeopardy! “With three contestants per game you’re averaging somewhere over five hands to keep track of and make sure they don’t send the racism signals that cause the racism. So no more hands. That means we’re only taking contestants with no hands or who are willing to have their hands cut off. What’s a smart solution?”Handless contestants incapable of racism signals will now have to hit their buzzers with their heads which has slowed down the show a bit though some like the change. There is still some concern a contestant could say a secret racism codeword which Jeopardy! thought of addressing by cutting out contestants’ tongues but that ended up changing the show’s format too much.

With me seizing the country after it’s been staggered by the pandemic there was an opportunity for me to immediately eradicate this country. But I failed.”It was a simple plan. After the wildly successful Trump presidency made America great again the Democrats used the pandemic (which wasn’t really a big deal) to destroy the flourishing economy. All that they needed after that was to steal the presidential election (check) and get a meager majority in Congress to enact a radical unconstitutional agenda to finish off the nation the people Democrats hate more than any other.“I thought I could destroy all freedom in 100 days with my executive orders and the help of the Senate” Biden stated “but I couldn’t do it. The American people are too resilient; I hate them so much.”Other Democrats agreed that Biden has been a failure. “He couldn't even destroy capitalism” said Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. “People are still buying things and enjoying themselves. It’s the worst!”Biden is hoping to keep his promise of the complete destruction of the U.S. in his next 100 days though which he plans to do by spending trillions of dollars on useless infrastructure -- building bridges we don’t need or some such garbage -- until the economy collapses in on itself. “Muh ha ha ha!” he added.

Americans will no longer be able to gorge themselves on hundreds of food options in their city as there will be one food option: the bread line which will usually have no bread."If we really want to get Americans skinny -- and I mean really skinny -- we need to switch to communism right away" said Joe Biden in a speech Friday. "Have you seen some of those pictures from the Soviet Union -- the ones the government didn't destroy and murder the journalists who took them? We're talking some really serious weight loss here.""It's my recommendation that we move to communism immediately for best results."Health experts say that switching from capitalism to communism can help people lose up to 50% of their body weight almost right away as the government is unable to efficiently distribute goods and resources as the free market does. Throw in a famine or two thanks to bureaucrats who know nothing about farming handing down edicts about how to farm and you are looking at the perfect scenario for incredible weight loss.The move to communism will also address overcrowding and population growth.

Then he cut back the number of extra choruses he added on to “Way Maker” and quit informing us between each song how to posture our hearts. We knew age was starting to catch up with him.”Sources say Miller took the news hard stooping so low as to offer to play tambourine if he could only stay in the praise band. While the church leadership agreed older people were allowed to play the tambourine the pastors did not feel they could in good conscience allow Joe to debase himself like that. They did kindly offer to give Joe strong references if he wanted to go play the organ for the old fogies at the Lutheran church down the street.Joe reportedly landed an interview to be the worship leader at another evangelical church but was turned away at the door when he arrived wearing a starched polo.

They quickly devastated his argument by going into storage and dusting off their old KKK hoods which they then donned to show him just how racist America actually is."If America isn't racist would we be wearing these? Checkmate!" said Nancy Pelosi triumphantly as she solemnly put on the white hood. "Your move Republicans."Chuck Schumer also put on a hood having borrowed it from the Museum of Democratic History in D.C."My colleague is right -- if we weren't racist as Senator Tim Scott suggested why would we put on these white hoods with no political repercussions whatsoever? It's clear as day: America is racist." Schumer went on to propose reenacting Jim Crow laws in order to dunk on Senator Scott and prove his argument "completely without merit.""Senator Scott is truly an 'Uncle Tim' after all.""Furthermore we will begin instituting separate but equal Senate chambers for senators of color. Just to show them how racist America still is." Reporters applauded Schumer for his bold move toward equality by saying and doing really racist things to show that America is still racist.Pelosi and Schumer assured everyone they were wearing a smug look of being proven right on their faces though you couldn't tell. Because of the hoods.

Says Biden In Dynamic Speech Echoing All Of America's Concerns",WASHINGTON D.C.—“Who are you? Where are my pills?” These are powerful words from President Joe Biden’s joint address to Congress that echoed the concern of many Americans.When the speech first started Biden spent a whole minute staring quietly at his audience looking deep into the soul of America before then inquiring in increasingly agitated tones “Who are you? Who are all you people? What’s happening?”“This is the question we’re facing as we’ve been ravaged by a pandemic” said pundit Gerard Carson in response to the speech. “Who are we now as a people? That’s what Biden was asking us.”Later in the speech Biden shifted gears. “Where are my pills?” he demanded. “Someone took my pills.” He then pointed an accusing finger at America itself. “Did you take my pills?”“I think it’s the question we’re all asking” commented analyst Shelly Reeves. “Where is the cure to what ails us? And is it our own actions that are keeping us in this crisis? Biden really understands the problems we’re facing.”While much of the speech was symbolic like that the ending was much more straightforward with Biden shouting “Malarkey!” over and over before rushing into the audience to bite Chief Justice John Roberts.

This will allow them to make delicious banana bread later--which they're totally going to do.Later that week they also decided to purchase a second trash can for all the leafy greens they always buy but never touch.

This slight loosening of restrictions has now caused Yellowstone National Park to consider ending the requirement that all buffalo wear masks.The masking requirement for buffalo has been controversial since it was first adopted in March of last year. Many feel it ruins nature pictures to see wildlife in masks. Also some see it as unnecessary since the buffalo are all outside and are buffalo.Still Yellowstone had defended the decision. “The fact is” said Yellowstone Park Director and Founder Bob Yellowstone “they are gathering in large groups which everyone knows is a COVID risk factor. Now you can cite all your ‘science’ about mitigating risk factors such as their being outside and not being human but it just looks bad for them not to wear masks in a pandemic. If people see them maskless they may say ‘I guess I don’t need one either as I’m also a mammal.’”Despite this Yellowstone is saying they are considering now removing the buffalo mask requirement. As for the other controversial requirement -- having the bears wear ties which was initially part of a 2010 cross-promotion for the Yogi Bear movie -- they say they’ve just gotten used to that and have no plans to end it.

Cuomo then finished his meatball sub and began plowing into a large bowl of spaghetti.Critics of the governor insisted that 15000 precious human lives were worth infinitely more than just a seat in Congress but Cuomo was unable to hear them due to chewing his food too loudly.Cuomo is promising new initiatives to ensure more people fill out the census as they should in order to counteract all the people dying and leaving his state in record numbers.

This has made some wonder if Biden even understands how a virus works but Biden says he’s just being cautious.“We can’t let our guard down just because we’re vaccinated and alone in a room” Biden told reporters with a megaphone while standing twenty feet away. “See there is this little thing called a ‘computer virus.’ Ha I bet you thought I was some out-of-touch boomer who doesn’t know about computers. Well for one thing I’m too old to be a boomer -- I’m the generation before that -- and I’ve used typewriters since I was a kid -- which is a lot like a computer before you attach the TV. So I know all about computers and they get viruses. Maybe COVID. Who knows? Better to wear a mask around them.”Doctor Fauci agreed with Biden’s assessment. “We haven’t done any studies about coronaviruses becoming computer viruses and computer viruses transferring to humans” Fauci said “so we can’t rule that out. I would stay away from computers as much as possible and if you are around a computer put a mask over the part where the fan vents. And as I keep saying if at all possible please just lock yourself in a large footlocker in your basement as that’s the safest way to ride out this pandemic.”Others aren’t convinced and have made fun of Biden for his seemingly pointless mask-wearing with nicknames such as “Dumb Biden” “Stupid Biden” and “Biden -- Not a Smart Man.” Still Biden persists with his extra caution and was last seen wearing a mask alone in the bathroom while fixing his hair. “Mirror Joe Biden could have COVID for all I know” he explained.

"I think it's time to start arresting these people before they take to the streets and start damaging property and terrorizing people. If we don't do something soon it might get ugly."Reporters pressed Wheeler to explain why he had taken the side of the fascists considering Antifa means "anti-fascist" which means anyone who opposes them is a fascist."Yes this is a disturbing thought" replied Wheeler. "It bothers me to consider that I may be a fascist now. I think the answer is to oppose Antifa with our cherished progressive values like love tolerance and diversity. And gulags."Wheeler has asked Biden to send in National Guard troops as well but his request was denied since Antifa is just an idea.

Being considerate and helping your wife around the house is key to a healthy marriage-- and it doesn't even have to be hard work! We drew from decades of combined marriage experience to compile a list of easy ways to help your wife out.1. Rinse a dish and leave it near the sink: Your lady will swoon when she sees how considerate you are! For bonus points place the dish in the sink so she can easily put it in the dishwasher later.2. Place excess trash in an organized pile near the trash can until she takes it out:  Little things to make her life easier go such a long way!3. Avoid the toilet seat debate by peeing in the sink: Lifehack!4. Never shower so she'll have fewer towels to fold: Also if you never wear socks you'll never get in trouble for not throwing them in the hamper.5. Helpfully gather all the dirty clothes and passive-aggressively place them in front of the washer: Whatever you do DON'T actually put them in the washer. You'll probably do it wrong.6. Leave her helpful instructions on sticky notes around the house so she'll know how to do things properly: You can add little hearts and "XOXOXO" for extra romance.7. Say helpful phrases like "My mom didn't do it that way" when she's cleaning: Wives love to learn new things from their mothers-in-law. What a great way to pass down helpful knowledge!8. Send her pictures of the messes around the house while she's away so she can mentally prepare for the tasks ahead of her: This selfless act will help her stay mentally organized. It's the least you can do.9. Start the lawnmower for her: Use your big man strength to start the mower so she has more energy to mow the lawn. If you really want to drive her crazy roll up your sleeves so she sees your big arms while you crank the engine.10. Pick up your feet while playing Xbox so she can vacuum under them: Invest in your marriage and do it without being asked!11. Place all the sandwich ingredients together on the counter to cut down on her lunch-making time: For extra helpfulness leave another sticky note to help her make it correctly.12. Have many children so they can help around the house: And if you're a Mormon you can also take a second wife to help your first wife with the chores!There you have it! Now go and invest in your marriage!NOT SATIRE: Marriage Helper provides a research-based program that thousands of couples have used to save their marriages.

It gave people a headache just to look at him.“It's baffling to observe” said one person. “You see the MAGA hat and go ‘Here’s some far-right Trumper’ but then you see the pointless virtue-signaling mask and think ‘Here’s some left-wing ninny who is going to go all Karen on me.’”"It's like pick a lane man!"No one was able to comprehend the man as he was strongly signaling two opposite political beliefs like someone wearing a Gadsden flag shirt with a hammer and sickle pin. A number of theories arose about him. Some thought he was wearing the mask because he was a Trump-loving ninja. Others suggested he was a far-left weenie whose head was cold and just didn’t pay much attention when grabbing a hat perhaps thinking it was a Cincinnati Reds hat.What people eventually settled on is that he was maybe one of those libertarians and everyone should definitely observe at least a six-foot distance from him lest he start arguing with them.

They are terrible. And I’m not just talking about the music they listen to (which is kind of over-produced and soulless). They are running wild and have no respect for anyone. That’s why when they grow older and get mad they just riot like it’s nothing breaking everything and setting everything on fire.How’d this happen? I will tell you how. Back some time ago someone started an anti-spanking movement. “Oh you can’t spank kids. It will hurt their widdle kid feewings” said some so-called “experts” -- probably Communist plants trying to destroy us from the inside. So what do you do when the kid talks back? Just gently pat him on the head and try to reason with his dumb kid brain and explain why you don’t like that? That don’t work; the only thing kids understand is a red backside. And without that kids got no fear of authority. As soon as they’re older they’re going to just start looting Targets. Oh the Commies are laughing at us now.“Spare the rod spoil the downtown Portland” -- that’s what they say. We got a bunch of people with untouched buttocks running around and destroying everything. So what do we do? Well you start on the next generation and don’t make the same mistakes. Any kid steps out of line you give them a firm whack. I don’t care if it’s your kid or not; this is a civil service to every drugstore that doesn’t want to get burned down. And they say people are becoming adults later and later which means we can extend the spanking window. I propose bringing corporal punishment to college campuses. It would do those Marxist idiots some good to get a few whacks from a paddle.And as for those too old for spanking and already running around rioting I guess you can try hitting them with those like police batons. A few whacks to the head can’t hurt. I mean it will hurt them but I don’t like them.

I couldn’t come up with any other examples.” Kendi laughed. “I guess I was making the same mistake as racists and overgeneralizing based on race. White people aren’t the problem; just Steve.”“Yeah the problem isn’t whiteness; it’s Steve-ness” said White Fragility author Robin DiAngelo who is now updating her book and changing the title to Steve Fragility. “I can’t believe we were blaming a whole group of people when really it was just Steve. It makes me hate Steve even more. Grr! Steve!”As for Steve when asked about being the real problem he didn’t say anything but made a dumb expression that just made everyone want to punch him. Steve is the worst.Dang it Steve!

Permission she says really should be sought from the criminal rather than the police station when putting anyone in custody."Before our officers arrest any criminal they will have to ask the criminal's permission" said Lightfoot. "To do otherwise would be to violate the criminal's rights as he beats someone up shoots another human or burgles homes and business.""This is community policing at its finest where the criminal is always right."Police will have to get a permission slip signed by the criminal ask them about their feelings and inform them that they have the right to leave at any time for any reason at all. Should the criminal decide they would like to continue committing crimes instead of being arrested the police officer will be forced to apologize and pay reparations for offending the victim.

It’s survived billions of years and onslaughts of meteorites but today we can finally save it by raising taxes and enacting the Green New Deal.”Atheists have already said that they can’t wait to celebrate MRHTS Day again next year but if the Earth and all life ceased to exist that would also be okay because nothing matters!

But they're finally changing their tune after unborn babies started wielding knives in a threatening manner calling the babies "precious little innocents" and demanding that nobody kill them even though they looked pretty dangerous on an ultrasound.Unborn babies got the idea to wield the knives after many liberals defended the actions of a girl who recently tried to stab another girl and was shot by police. So far the unborn say nearly 100% of liberals have changed their mind on abortion and rallied to their cause."Stop killing our babies!" chanted one protester outside a Planned Parenthood. "This precious little life holding a knife is clearly an innocent bystander and should not be killed. We used to think these were just clumps of cells but once we saw the ultrasound and the baby tried to stab us we realized they were actually lives worth defending. No one should take the life of one of our knife-wielding babies."At publishing time LeBron James had tweeted a picture of an abortion doctor with the ominous caption "YOU'RE NEXT."

The excuse he gave as he rushed in five minutes after the service was supposed to start was that he drove over a bridge and felt compelled to drive over it again and again."I couldn't help it -- as soon as I went over that bridge once I just had to drive back over it 17 times. It was bizarre" Mallory said. "It really set me back in my church commute. I'll pick another route next time and skip the bridge entirely. Although now that I think about it what's the point of a commute if you don't get to drive over a bridge over and over again? Bridges get better every time you repeat them. Let's be honest they're even better the 27th time."Mallory confirmed that on the way to church his wife had begged him to stop repeating the bridge and that "no one likes bridges -- maybe one once in a while but not over and over again." But he told her she was crazy and that everyone likes bridges especially when they are repeated many many many many many many times.

Just roll this handy new die" said a WOTC rep. "It makes character creation fast fun and streamlined. And don't worry -- if you don't like your gender just roll it again no questions asked. In fact you can do that at any point during the game without even consulting your DM. Change at any time.""See when you're playing a game that was designed for players to go raid dungeons get loot and kill dragons the important thing is that you spend 14 hours trying to determine your character's sexuality gender sex and political positions" he continued. "That's what made this hobby so popular: screeching leftists on Tumblr and we have to cater to these hardcore fans."A revised copy of the Player Handbook contains rules for using the die. All players must select one of the hundred genders upon creating their character. "Men" and "women" are of course not included out of sensitivity to non-binary folk. Any PC that refers to another PC as the wrong gender will instantly be killed by a falling meteor. Then the player controlling that character is subject to cancelation in the real world.Wizards also confirmed that the sixth edition of Dungeons & Dragons will include a D1000 for selecting your character's pronouns.

But a new scientific study has shown that the Meow Mix slogan is in fact false advertising as the cats were never asking specifically for Meow Mix but were simply making a standard cat noise.“I began to notice something was awry when I realized cats never said the full name of the product” said Scientist Trevor Peterson. “They only said the first part -- ‘Meow’ -- but never the ‘Mix’ part that went after it.” This led Peterson to conduct a decade-long study on cats communication and eating habits. The results just published Monday show that cats say ‘Meow’ even when their preferred food is Purina Friskies or Fancy Feast.“‘Meow’ just seems to be a sound that all cats make” said Peterson explaining the conclusion of the report. “One they make all the time -- sometimes for no discernable reason.”After the report was published Meow Mix was immediately hit with a class-action lawsuit for its false advertising. The headquarters for Meow Mix was found empty though as everyone who worked there apparently fled with their ill-gotten gains obtained by tricking consumers.The scandal has caused further scrutiny of other aspects of Meow Mix such as whether cats were actually singing the Meow Mix theme or if that was done with some sort of audio trickery.

From external threats to internal fighting and inept governance on nearly every level the country doesn't appear to be long for this world which causes the man great stress and fear. But then Atkinson stops worrying and goes about his life because he remembers that his hope isn't in the United States at all."I look at this fallen world and I start thinking about how screwed we are" he said as he looked at the news on his smartphone. "But then I take a deep breath and remember the United States will fall one day and join the other civilizations in the ruins of history. And I'll be OK because my hope is in another place. Christ's kingdom will last forever and that's good enough for me."Atkinson then experienced twelve seconds of bliss as he looked upon Christ and His eternal promises to His people before his sinful nature caused him to worry and doubt again and open Twitter to see what new terrible thing was going to happen next. Sources close to Atkinson confirmed he goes through this cycle over 137 times a day but that Christ is always faithful to him despite his faithlessness.

That’s why despite getting vaccinated he’s listening to Dr. Anthony Fauci and the CDC and continuing to wear a mask even when outside. “There’s still a risk I could get the virus out there” said Stone. “It’s a pretty large number -- like ten million... dividing a one -- so it’s just right to be cautious.”Stone takes similar precautions when driving always wearing a helmet. “You could crash at any time” explained Stone -- who was also wearing a mask while alone in the car to protect against the less than a billionth chance of viral infection in that situation. “That’s why in addition to a seatbelt you need to wear a helmet when in a car. It’s also a good idea when using stairs. That’s just science.”Stone also stayed cautious when taking a bath always wearing water wings to help prevent drowning. “People drown all the time” Stone said. “Not usually grown adults in bathtubs but it happens. This is just trusting the science and taking known precautions.” Stone then put on a helmet to prepare to stand up from the bath.Dr. Fauci agreed with Stone’s assessment. “You have to be careful with these things” he said. “I would also wear water wings when anywhere near anyone else taking a bath in case you fall in. And wear a mask when bathing. Just don’t clean that part of your face.”

"Americans who use heaven as a tax shelter are unpatriotic and aren't paying their fair share.

Their religious teachings actually encourage them to forgo amassing earthly wealth in favor of building up heavenly wealth through faith and good works."This is very immoral" said Senator Bernie Sanders. "It's simply inhumane to let people in heaven enjoy all that wealth when so many people on earth-- not to mention in hell-- are having to do with less!"Since scientists and theologians have not yet found a way to confiscate wealth from the celestial realm Democrats will estimate people's heavenly treasure based on religious fervor and will require the taxes to be paid in full from the people's earthly treasure before they die."This is much fairer" said Senator Sanders.

I might start wearing three masks.”While many unvaccinated people have gone back to living their lives as normal those warier of the virus like Watson see behavior like that as murderous and evil. “Even with the vaccine there’s still a minuscule chance I could get it or spread it” Watson explained. “You never do things when there is a minuscule chance of harm. That’s why I never drive a car or take a shower since I could slip and die.

Facebook has now blocked this story from being shared on its platform.Originally Facebook gave no reason for blocking the story but eventually they released a statement saying their policy has always been to “defer to experts on who we are or have been at war with” and not let “dangerous misinformation be shared.”“It’s dangerous to let false information out there” explained Mark Zuckerberg to the press. “It’s also dangerous to let true information out there.

As they realize this will take some time to pay back they have stated they are graciously willing to take payment in the form of sandwiches for the time being.At publishing time men had withdrawn their request since women pointed out that if Adam had been there to lead his wife as the head of the household Satan probably wouldn't have been able to trick her.

By severing key components from the document they hope to repair the damage caused by Republicans.“Some people will say we're tearing the Constitution. We're not tearing. We're untearing” explained US Representative Jerold Nadler as he ripped the Constitution apart. “Senator McConnell and the Republicans were the ones who tore it up over the last couple of years. The only way to untear it is to tear it which will then retroactively repair it from the tearing of the Republicans. Wait hang on. I might have that backward. Well you get the idea."Jerry Nadler and Nancy Pelosi then proceeded to rip large chunks from the founding document. “There that fixes it!” Pelosi said as she tore out the 2nd amendment entirely. “Now it’s been untorn from how Republicans have sliced it to pieces by making it say things it never was intended to say.”"There can be no justification for what they did. How can Americans look at the Constitution and expect it to do equal justice when it has been so severely politically shredded?" added Nadler tossing the Constitution through a woodchipper.When Nadler and Pelosi were finished untearing the Constitution there was barely anything left. All that remained were two single scraps reading "War" and "Welfare."

He gestured to the stands where over seven fans were watching the game."The founding fathers of baseball never foresaw that one day we would be losing a game against the LDS of all people" he added. "The rules of baseball are flexible -- a living document. Therefore we should be able to change the rules in the middle of a game to our advantage."If the rule change goes through the church team will be allowed to immediately appoint four outfielders to join the game to help silence the Mormons' bats.It may all be a moot point however as the Mormons have been accused of looking at seer stones to predict the opposing teams' plays.

But we’re going to be extra careful this time because sometimes even the liberal justices will say ‘The Constitution doesn’t allow that' and we’ll be like ‘Why did you even read that thing?!’ With these new justices that could never happen.”According to the bill any new justices will have to completely fail a reading test to qualify for the bench. They will also need to pass a questionnaire making sure they have progressive values. Questions are along the lines of “Do you like free stuff?” and “If you’re really sure you think you know better than someone else should you be able to force them to do whatever you want?”Republicans are vehemently opposed to this bill. “This is just wrong” said Senator Ted Cruz. “You can’t add illiterate justices to the Supreme Court.

'April 14th 2021',https://babylonbee.com/news/7-ways-the-world-would-be-better-without-police,"7 Ways The World Would Be Better Without Police",Police are part of a system of oppression that is very systemic and oppressive. It's true-- our rich white sociology professor told us so. Some politicians are calling for us to "reimagine policing" but we think that's not far enough! It's time to imagine a world with no police!Here are 7 reasons the world would be better without police.1. There would be more doughnuts available for the rest of us - We're sick of showing up at the doughnut shop to find the police already came in and took all the best ones. Oppression at its finest.2. Vigilante justice is way more fun - At least according to the movies it is. Why call the police when you can form your own posse and hunt down the evildoers yourself?3. With speed limits not enforced you can finally test the limits of your 2013 Honda Odyssey - Always wanted to see what this puppy could do!4. There would be much more liberation of TVs from Walmart - Think about it: there are thousands of TVs tennis shoes and top-shelf liquor being held in captivity all across the nation. It's time to liberate these high-priced goods from their shelves!5. Unlimited loitering outside 7-Eleven - You can stand out there for hours and no one will bother you. Heaven on earth!6. You can yell in the library now - Not only that but you can check out unlimited books and never bring them back with complete impunity.7. All problems in the black community will go away - Everything wrong in the inner city is the cops' fault. If the cops go everything will be solved. It's just that simple!Isn't it fun to imagine? Now all we have to do is vote in politicians who will promise to make all the cool things in our imagination come true. Get on it people!

Also not everyone is sure those deaths are related to the vaccine and believe they may in fact be caused by the carelessness of construction workers.Dr. Fauci has dismissed these criticisms. “Everyone wants things to make sense but I think we’ve made it clear that’s not how we approach things” said Fauci. “And who is in a big rush to end this pandemic anyway? We all like wearing masks and staying home. We especially like seeing me on TV all the time. Or at least I know I do.”

Introduce a ranch-flavored vaccine - White hicks can't resist some delicious Hidden Valley.3.

It's like "We Are the World" but for the vaccine.5. Tell them not getting the vaccine is gay - Super gay.6. Make vaccines mandatory for entrance into Cracker Barrel - Hit 'em where it hurts.7. Disguise it as Keystone Light - They'll think they're throwing back some delicious American lager while they're really getting microchips implanted in their brains.8. Get some Hollywood actors to explain how it's a great thing to do -  Works every time.9. Interrupt Duck Dynasty reruns with a pro-vaccine message from the true president Donald Trump - Maybe her best idea.10. Tell them vaccines are proven to lift their trucks an additional seven feet - If your truck remains lifted for 4-6 hours consult a mechanic.Great ideas Jen!

But we're experts and experts always know what they're talking about.We sat and meditated in our expert brains and came up with the definitive methods for stopping racism in its tracks. Here they are -- 10 easy ways to end racism forever:1. Kill all white people. - An easy one. And if you're white well you know what to do.2. Pluck out everyone's eyes. - Can't be racist if you can't see.3. Bravely walk through a riot and give some police officers a cool refreshing Pepsi. - Effective and refreshing. This tip brought to you by Pepsi. #sponsored4. Teach everyone to always focus on race as the most important thing about a person. - The only way to end racism is to make sure you're constantly talking about race and never letting people forget what the color of their skin is for even a second.5. Have the earth get invaded by flesh-eating aliens so we have a common enemy to unite against. - Bring on the aliens.6. Segregate people by skin color. - We can't talk honestly about racism if we're all just mixed together like a melting pot. We need to segregate into different rooms schools and drinking fountains.7. Steal some Nikes. - Racism will crumble as you bash the window of the Nike store and leave with some sweet kicks.8. Start an organization to fight racism and use the proceeds to buy multiple mansions. - Every time you buy a big house forty million racists drop dead.9. Have an after-school special about how racism is bad hosted by a cool TV star like Kirk Cameron. - You could have on trendy bands like Hanson and Kris Kross and the kids would all give up their racist ways.10. Whatever you do don't believe the lie that we're all one blood and race is a social construct meant to divide us. - This is dangerous Christian brainwashing and will only lead to people treating each other the same. And we can't defeat racism that way.Now go forth and punch racism in the face or at least your neighbor if you suspect he's a racist!

When your IV bag runs out of vaccine fluid you can simply go back to your local pharmacy for a refill at a nominal fee.“Immunity? Yeah of course  that’s the idea” said Pfizer’s Chief Business Officer. “Americans desperately hope that if they are stuck by enough needles that they can go back to work fully open their businesses and have their kids in school again and this continuous drip is an option for that.”The IV drip version of the vaccine comes in the wake of many prominent politicians signaling that life still couldn’t return to normal despite the millions of normal vaccine jabs many Americans had already received. However if they hook themselves up to this continuous drip system they might have a shot at that someday.“Now this is a game-changer and I think it will do a lot of good though experts don’t foresee life getting back to normal until at least late 2022” said Dr. Fauci when asked about the new state-of-the-art vaccine delivery system.At publishing time Dr. Fauci confirmed that though this IV delivery system is a great measure in the fight against COVID-19 Americans must continue to socially distance and wear masks at all times in public.

At publishing time he had further added that he fully expects the government to stop spending so much money now that the pandemic is over.

When you subscribe to the service for an additional $666 per month instead of having your kids learn leftist values from Disney Channel shows Marvel films and one of the 177 Star Wars shows on the service they can get it straight from the drag queen's mouth.Conservative parents were kind of upset about the new service but most shrugged their shoulders and said "Eh.

But while everyone celebrates stars like Bob and Larry you may have forgotten these one-off characters who aren't as well remembered:1. Karen the Kale Leaf - Karen showed up in an early episode but was quickly canned as no one liked her. Dang it Karen!2. Andy the Amorphous Blob of Quinoa - Much like Karen no one liked Andy. Sad!3. Kyle the Monster Energy Drink - An early attempt to introduce product placement Kyle was unfortunately a flop.4. Stabbin' Steve the Murderous Vegetable Cleaver - Deemed way too dark for kids after thousands were sent to therapy Steve never made an appearance again.5. Fred the Fermented Grape - Fred showed up to teach kids a lesson about alcoholism. Baptists complained at the use of the fermented fruit and Phil Vischer issued an apology shortly after the episode's release.6. Lucy the Neglected Lettuce You Forgot About In Your Fridge Weeks Ago - Part of Michelle Obama's push to get kids eating health the lettuce just kind of sat on the table looking sad as everyone ignored it.7. Marley the Psychadelic Mushroom - A drug-abuse-themed episode that never aired starred Marley. He and Larry go on an insane trip and somehow end up seventy miles away from the kitchen sink in an Arby's.8. Gary the Garbage Disposal - Big Idea tried their hand at a horror-themed episode "What's Eating Bob?" where Gary murders Bob violently. It didn't quite connect with Sunday School audiences.9. Dave Ramsey's brief cameo as a bowl of rice and beans - Dave showed up and lectured Jerry Gourd on his constant need to eat out and Larry's obsession with SUVs trying to get them to rein in their spending habits. Kids were even more scared of Dave than they were of Gary the Garbage Disposal.10. Bob the Tomato after his tragic run-in with Gary the Garbage Disposal - Many felt the show jumped the shark during this episode dubbed "The Search for Bob." He was resurrected as a ketchup bottle raising all kinds of questions about the afterlife in the VeggieTales universe.Did these remind you of your childhood days?

People will also have to undergo background checks even though many disadvantaged people out in rural areas are unable to afford a background. “Please show me your background so I can check it” they’ll hear when they go to purchase a firearm and when they say they don’t have a background they’ll be told “Then get out of here! We don’t serve your kind!”The very thought of this is said to make Biden laugh in the most racist of ways.Republicans who love all people of all colors are opposed to this. “We know two things about President Biden” said Senator Mitch McConnell. “We know he is very old and very racist. Oh we also know his name is Joe. That’s the third thing.

Two trillion. Internet slow to buffer Matlock? Two trillion. I can do this all day Jack!” After the announcement experts expected the flood of migrants to grow to about 20 million per day. “This is a normal seasonal surge” explained Jen Psaki.  “It definitely definitely has nothing to do with the big stacks of cash. The weather has been super nice which explains the extra millions of people. But I do think it also really speaks to what a great guy Joe Biden is. Everyone holding an armful of money has had really great things to say about Uncle Joe.”The administration touted the border cash as a well-targeted approach to addressing poverty but also noted that it has been unexpectedly effective for gun control. "We are really proud to report that since dumping epic loads of cash on the border the gun stores are completely empty. There are simply no firearms left to purchase even the cartels seem to have their fill of weaponry. We’re really proud of what we’ve accomplished" reported DHS chief Alejandro Mayorkas.Children stood along the side of the road in Texas to watch truckload after truckload of cash go by on its way to the border. “Where does all the cash come from Daddy?” asked seven-year-old Annie Sue.

That's not even the right Georgia!CLAIM: The law reduces voting locations to just one polling place hidden in a maze where you must fight a minotaur.FACT: True. You can also just answer the minotaur’s riddle.CLAIM: The law declares that voting for Democrats is treason and makes it punishable by death.FACT:  Mostly true. However the sentence is only life in prison if one can prove the vote for a Democrat was unintentional.CLAIM: The law reduces early voting.FACT: False. It actually expands early voting. In fact you can vote for Trump 2024 right now.CLAIM: The law could lead to the elimination of all rights in Georgia.FACT: False. Your constitutional rights will be even safer because Democrats will be less likely to win.The more you know the more empowered you are.

"The harsh reality is we women make a lot less than men -- 77 cents on the dollar in fact. That's just what we women have to deal with being born women and stuff. That's not something we can change.""I mean if we could just snap our fingers and announce that we were men we'd make a lot more money but that's just not reality. It's not the way the world works. So we're stuck with the hand dealt to us by biology."Analysts estimate that just by being a woman which Jenner certainly is Jenner will make $161700 a year as governor instead of the usual pay of $210000. The savings of $48300 will be enough to start chipping away at the deficit or else to throw one fancy dinner at the French Laundry.

But the MPAA now says that reviewing films and trying to identify all the offensive content is too difficult and time-consuming since it can take many days or weeks to slowly go through each movie and find the thousands of instances of sex violence and language.So to save time the MPAA will now just warn viewers when a film doesn't have a gratuitous amount of nudity sex violence drugs and alcohol use. Every movie submitted to the MPAA will just automatically be assumed to have all of these things in ridiculous quantities and a film will only get a warning label if it displays a concerning lack of provocative content."Honestly this is going to save us so much time" said an MPAA film reviewer. "I mean don't get me wrong I love watching raunchy movies and writing down all the naughty parts but you just get numb to it after a while. I had to watch Wolf of Wall Street 87 times to identify all the morally offensive content. It took me three weeks! Three weeks of my life! Do you know how many times I could have watched Breaking Bad in three weeks? What a waste!"Movies without the required amount of sex violence and language will be slapped with the dreaded red band warning and an "FV" rating for "Family Values."

"We are always looking for any signs of gender nonconforming behavior in our students so we can get them the essential gender treatment they need."The school superintendent made it clear that once Abby returns to school as a boy she will be allowed to play with the action figure again during recess.When asked whether Abby's parents would be notified the superintendent replied: "Goodness no. Her parents don't need to hear about any of that. They're probably religious weirdos anyway. No these decisions are best left to experts like us."According to sources Abby returned to school later that day as "Abe" (he/him).

And as they promote the law Democrats have a dire warning: If HR 1 isn’t passed Republicans could sometimes win elections.“If we don’t radically change voting laws” Senator Chuck Schumer told the press “we could have horrible outcomes to elections in which Republicans sometimes win. We Democrats along with journalists have explained over and over to the American people that Republicans are bad and Democrats are smart and good and yet Republicans keep sometimes winning. Obviously something bad is going on there and it must be stopped.”HR 1 will help stop Republicans from winning by allowing more mail-in voting and other methods that will allow Democrats to stall voting counts for weeks to “find” more votes when needed. It will also make voting so easy that it will ensure the enfranchisement of Democrats’ most reliably loyal group: foreign terrorists who hate America and want to destroy it.If the bill passes Democrats assure people that something like President Trump winning -- or any other Republican winning -- will never happen again. There are some concerns that the bill could be ruled unconstitutional but Democrats say that would only happen if people interpret the Constitution as “some sort of document with words that actually mean things.”

Red Skull is known for sharing dangerous and counter-cultural messages to young men-- telling them to take responsibility order their lives properly and clean up their rooms.Ta-Nehisi Coates has penned the gripping new storyline where America’s spandex-clad champion who has historically stood for justice and democracy is converted into the polar opposite of all that: an alt-right sympathizer who works on himself and refuses to use a person’s preferred pronouns. Captain America is basically a Nazi now.In the story the villainous Red Skull is depicted as ensnaring the disaffected youths of a postmodern culture with evil alt-right messages like "tell the truth" and "pet a cat when you encounter one on the street."In one horrific scene Steve follows the Red Skull’s nefarious and bigoted advice to “make something beautiful” and to “set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world.” We see him whisper "Hail Hydra" as he organizes his closet. He then hangs a beautiful Monet painting on the wall of his recently redecorated home office.Experts say Captain America is only the latest to be sucked in by Red Skull's evil call to self-improvement and straddling the line between order and chaos.Marvel has hinted that in the next issue Captain America will undergo diversity and anti-racist training at S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters and be rescued from the dark path he's on.

But hang in there fellow Christians for the end is near. Jesus might be coming soon. We've been reading the signs studying the book of Revelation and listening to our favorite Calvary Chapel pastors on the radio.Here are fifteen signs the apocalypse might be happening soon:1. A TikTok rapper made some Satan shoes -- Seriously-- what happened to the good old days when rappers just did drugs had sex with strippers and sang about shooting cops? Never has pop culture stooped so low.2. Avocado toast? -- It's actually delicious. But it's also stupid. Just like pretty much everything in our culture. It's time for Jesus to return and make everything not stupid again.3. Joshua Harris is an atheist and Kanye West is a Christian -- Think that's crazy? Mr. T writes better Christian tweets than Tim Keller now.4. Chick-fil-A has abandoned us -- They were the last bulwark of American Christianity washed away in a sea of wokeness and wishy-washy corporate lameness. The end is near.5. The military has gone woke -- Better learn Mandarin now because that's what all the remaining survivors will be speaking.6. They made an Aquaman movie and it was pretty good -- How. Like seriously how.7. The Pope might not be Catholic -- Has this ever happened before? Yes? Oh ok. Nevermind then.8. Donald Trump was our president and didn't even rank in the bottom half of presidents -- Amazing.9. They're stamping vaccine passports on our hands and foreheads -- The Left Behind book series tried to warn us about this. But not enough people got the word since they never finished making the movies. We're doomed.10. The dolphins have all abandoned Earth -- Safely back on their home planet of EE-ee-ee-ee they will witness the final destruction of Earth.11. All the Sesame Street characters have murdered each other in a bloody race war -- Oh-- that hasn't happened yet? Well stand by.Things are pretty messed up and honestly we're just kinda hoping Jesus comes back soon. At least before Amazon has a chance to completely ruin Lord of the Rings!

'April 5th 2021',https://babylonbee.com/news/godzilla-vs-kong-the-babylon-bee-review,"Review: 'Godzilla Vs. Kong' Is Fun -- But What Does It Do For Minorities, Immigrants, And The LGBTQ+ Community?",Godzilla vs. Kong (2021)Directed by Adam WingardAction Sci-Fi Thriller  PG-13   1h 53mGodzilla Vs. Kong roared into theaters this past weekend as the long-awaited match-up between the two legendary beasts. The film had lizard-punching action and jaw-dropping spectacle to spare but it left me wondering: is this the movie we need right now?I sat in the theater my mask and face shield firmly attached to my face. Someone coughed three rows up -- but the scariest thing in this place wasn't the threat of dying from COVID. It was the lack of progressive agenda on screen as we watched a monkey and a lizard punch each other.This ain't it chief.That was the thought running through my head for the duration of the latest 160 million-dollar missed opportunity to stand up for trans people and fight for oppressed BIPOC bodies in America​​.​​​​​With so much potential for in-your-face social messaging on progressive issues Godzilla vs. Kong utterly failed to explore Godzilla's thoughts on the greater social injustices of our day. Sure we know Godzilla’s stance when it comes to fighting for the fate of Earth but why haven’t we explored his take on the pandemic gender identity Georgia's voter law and ease of access to government-funded abortion?It was bad enough when Kong failed to observe the proper social distancing guidelines as he tackled Godzilla but that’s not what completely pulled me out of the film. After escaping the clutches of the humans my jaw dropped as I watched Kong refuse to use his platform to speak out on gun control. All immersion was lost for me as it was simply unbelievable that someone in his position would choose to remain silent instead of speaking truth to power.And then of course there’s always been the nagging unanswered question of Godzilla’s sexuality. Certainly it’s been hinted at here and there teeming under the surface with cryptic but obvious signs to those who are paying attention (he's gay by the way) but never a definitive answer. It’s beyond frustrating. With the audience left wondering I was forced to loudly shout "GODZILLA IS GAY!" at the screen.And in a 2-hour action spectacle isn't there any room for a 20-minute scene in which the characters discuss white supremacy and unconscious bias? Throughout the entire film never once does Kong step up and answer for his privilege of having his own island. Consequently it’s unfathomable to him that others might not have had it so easy which clearly manifests itself in his treatment towards Godzilla. I couldn't help but think of the rise of anti-Asian hate as I watched Kong punch the famous Japanese lizard.As far as action goes it's all done competently. The lizard breathes fire while the monkey punches stuff. But while the two destroy the city I noticed a complete lack of BIPOC representation among those crushed under these monsters' feet. Must we continue whitewashing an already stark white industry?The problematic nature of the film even extends to the main casting choices: Godzilla and Kong's voices are both digitally generated. Why were they not voiced by actual giant monsters? Instead some overpaid audio engineer collects a paycheck while two more perfectly qualified animals are out of a job. It’s hard to believe that I’m actually having to talk about this in 2021.As the movie wrapped up its 5th all-out brawl I found myself wondering if monsters depicted on-screen tearing each other apart shouldn’t have been us instead. That's when I had a profound and original thought: humans are the real monsters. When I choose to see the movie through this lens-- as a metaphor for all the shortcomings of peoplekind the movie becomes somewhat salvageable.The theater empties. I double-check my face shield and get up to leave. There's a bad aftertaste in my mouth and it's not from the popcorn. It's from what I just witnessed: a movie that didn't advance the agenda at all. A movie on the wrong side of history. A movie that just had two giant monsters punch each other to "entertain" and "distract" an audience from the superstructure of white supremacy all around us.I looked behind me to see a group of white men clapping having enjoyed the film.Of course it's white men I thought. This movie was made for them.1/2 out of 5 stars

The venue features lots of free labor so every role from the ball boys to the concession vendors won't cost the league a dime. In fact the workers are already happily chalking the baselines and tending the grass since if they don't they will be murdered."We must move the All-Star game to a place that shares our values" said MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred. "This prison yard is absolutely perfect and they're giving it to us absolutely free. What a friend we have in Communist China!""Most importantly the prison camp has no ban on early voting since there is no voting and no law against giving voters water since there are no voters. Or water."This should be one of the most exciting games in recent memory as any player who fails to stand for the Chinese pledge of allegiance or points to God to thank Him for a great play will be shot on sight.However the game will be limited to just three extra innings as Disney needs the space immediately after to film a documentary on Georgia's bad voting laws.

Mars supporters have pointed out that there is no actual record of any voter suppression (or voting) on Mars but NASA insists that the important thing is that the planet appears to be for the restriction of voting."Appearances are what matter most here" said NASA.Mars had been controversial as a target for exploration from the onset since it is a red planet. NASA is now instead setting its sights on a blue planet Uranus and plans to make all future missions there.

Their money is redistributed to Karl who then seizes Hooper's Store and executes all the oppressive human characters on Sesame Street.

Joaquin Phoenix came close while Jared Leto well didn't.But the studio believes it has now found the next Joker: Kamala Harris who has been hired to play the role in the upcoming film The Batman. Producers for the film got the idea while watching a press conference in which Harris was asked about the crisis at the border and responded with a creepy bone-chilling laugh."Her cackle that dead look in her eye -- she's perfect" said casting director Harry Flugelman. "I couldn't believe my ears when I heard her laugh -- that's the Joker we've been looking for all these years! Even better than Mark Hamill's voice work in the show and video games. Fantastic stuff really. This movie is going to make us so much money."The move wasn't without resistance however. Many people involved in the film believe that Kamala Harris's take on the character is far too dark even for DC."I know we did the whole murderous Superman and sociopathic Batman thing but I don't know -- does Kamala Harris take the character to a new darker place? Is it too much for audiences?" said one writer. "She's just way into the character even deeper into it than Ledger or Bale were back in the day. It's like she never takes off this persona of being a psychotic sociopath.""It's almost too creepy."

And nothing will be restrained from us... as long as we get rid of the filibuster. And we have trillions for buying brick for stone -- or at least can have the Fed grant it to us.

Republicans are opposed to the plan though as they call it “wasteful spending” and an “affront to God.”And there has been some concern that God will take offense. At one point it even seemed that God had confused people’s language as many of the people planning the tower started babbling incoherently. It turns out though that they were just directly quoting President Biden.

According to Hamill “After intense reading on Twitter I’ve learned that in China there are NO voter ID laws. And guess what you dumb Republicans – there has never been a single recorded case of fraud! Until Georgia can be a little more like China we need to do the right thing and make Georgians suffer.”Beijing has generously offered American companies major tax breaks to come film in the region. Additionally Xinjiang is ideal for filming scenes set in prisons or labor camps as China has offered ultra-realistic pre-built sets for these kinds of scenes. They even come with free actors for use as extras each of whom has been trained to act like they're being really oppressed."One day when Georgia is more like China we may return" said Hamill.

What was once a day of celebration marking a significant development in church history turns into a secular day for drinking collecting candy or getting a new Xbox.April Fools' Day is no exception. The world celebrates this day by pranking each other making fake announcements on the internet and other such tomfoolery. But we Christians know the true meaning of the holiday as we somberly recall the brutal martyrdom of St. April O'Fool in 723 A.D.Born in Ireland in 673 O'Fool lived a somewhat unlucky life as he was constantly stepping on rakes falling in pits and getting buckets of water dropped on his head while opening a door as a prank by one of his 17 brothers. It all came to a tipping point when the eldest of his brothers stout old Tom O'Fool pointed at his feet and said "Your shoe's untied" and then "Made you look." O'Fool wept bitterly for he had been had.But O'Fool demonstrated Christlike forgiveness in refusing to prank them back and eventually entered the monastic life frankly because monks didn't participate in pranks and also he got free therapy.After a decade in the monastery O'Fool decided to become a missionary and spread the gospel around Ireland teaching those in remote villages to stop their prankery and follow Christ. Legend has it he performed many miracles from saving a child who was about to be crushed by a piano to stopping some YouTubers who were going to pretend to scratch some rich guy's car.Finally O'Fool decided he needed to face his own demons and return home. As he entered the door seeing his family for the first time in years a bucket of water fell from the top of the door and killed him instantly."It was just a prank bro!" his brothers are rumored to have said but it was too late. And the brothers of O'Fool did weep bitterly only now realizing the errors of their ways. They dedicated their lives to spreading awareness about the dangers of pranks and selling merchandise featuring O'Fool's face which was quite profitable.Of course the true story has been distilled and secularized over the years and now you just have corporate brands using it to sell their wares. So as those around you prank each other meditate on the life of April O'Fool tragically slain this day.

I didn’t need to listen to nonsense to feel validated.”When Sally Glover heard that the President had just said that women can do anything as well as or better than a man she just shook her head and laughed. “Well that sounds a little patronizing to me” she said with a chuckle. “Fortunately I have 3 examples looking right at me of just how worthy and amazing I am-- but please tell me more about how I'm oppressed” she said.In fact Sally said she was glad that there are so many differences between men and women. “I’m thankful that we’re not all the same and that we think differently with different strengths and weaknesses” she added.Instead of worrying if she is as good as a man Sally lives every day fully and abundantly spending time with what matters the most: family.

He then cooked fried fish with malt vinegar and white smoke rose from the flames signaling the election of the first Pope.Protestantism: One day a triggered snowflake named Martin Luther nailed an incendiary comment on a giant door-- causing him to get excommunicated. He then went into hiding at Wartburg Castle to translate the Bible and invent the world's first Chick-fil-A sandwich. Things really got dicey when he started passing out AR-15s to the peasants.Catholicism: Do whatever the Pope says and kiss relics and pray while lighting lots of candles. If you have extra money you can use it to spring people out of purgatory. Feel really guilty all the time.Protestantism: Do whatever Pastor Bob says and buy lots of guns and Chick-fil-A. Vote Republican. Never feel guilty about anything ever.Catholicism: The Apostle Peter Mary James the Brother of Jesus Mel Gibson that priest from The Exorcist like every Hispanic grandma ever Joe Biden Pope Francis (maybe).Protestantism: The Apostle Paul Martin Luther pastors who like to wear cool clothes and have laser light shows every Sunday Joel Osteen.Catholicism: The definitive 73 books of the Bible The Sistine Chapel St Peter's Basilica The Mona LisaProtestantism: The definitive 66 books of the Bible God's Not Dead VeggieTales Adult coloring booksCatholics: Low blood sugar from fasting bad knees from kneeling.Protestants: Defenseless against vampires.Catholics: They are probably drinking beer like a lot of beer.

But the latest movie he’s working on has given him some trouble.“The movie is about a giant monkey fighting a giant lizard” explained Scott. “I’m really stumped on how to get anything about structural racism in here at all. I mean they’re just picking up buildings and hitting each other with them -- I don’t know what to do with this.”In the olden days Scott would have been happy to put some basic liberal politics in the movie by using Godzilla for an anti-nuclear message but that doesn’t meet the larger demands of progressive politics these days. “It’s like ... can I make one of them trans and that’s why people are so scared of them? Does that make any sense?”Scott is used to woke messaging completely grinding a movie to a halt but due to his integrity as a screenwriter he at least wants it to be somewhat organic. “Maybe it can be revealed that Godzilla can talk and then he gives a lecture on whiteness.” Scott thought about it some more. “No one is going to stand there listening to that when buildings are collapsing around them!” Scott fell onto his desk in defeat. “This movie is too awesome for me to ruin!”

Libertarianism is the only logically consistent political philosophy and it's held primarily by crazy people.But The Bee is here to set the record straight once and for all about our weird drug and Bitcoin-obsessed friends with this handy explainer.Founding: Libertarianism was officially founded in 1773 when the British colonists were like "A tax on tea? Blimey mate that's bloody mental!" After dumping tea in the harbor they launched fireworks ate barbecue and debated Ayn Rand.Beliefs: It's mostly about wanting to smoke weed and run around naked while shooting guns in the air we think. There's something in there about freedom liberty and the God-given right to defend yourself and your property too but honestly it's mostly about the weed. And buying Bitcoin. While smoking weed.Common symbols and mascots: The porcupine the Gadsden flag dank memes Dogecoin.Prominent proponents: Ron Paul that weird guy who's always smoking weed in your drama class Satan.Prominent critics: Republicans Democrats anyone who loves war and hates freedom. Also people who think weed is stinky.Key texts: Atlas Shrugged (we think no one's actually ever read it) The Law The Freakin' CONSTITUTION the book of Judges.How do you spot a Libertarian? You can usually smell their dank kush before you can see them. But if your sense of smell is still all wack from COVID look for guys carting around books from the 1700s and shouting "AM I BEING DETAINED?!" at everyone from police officers to Arby's cashiers.What is the Libertarian Party? A joke.What are the future prospects of Libertarianism? Not good.

Congressional staffers heard Biden gibbering incoherently so he seems fine other than the fact that he’s stuck.“Has he tried standing up?” Representative Jerry Nadler suggested.“Yes he’s tried!” Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi answered. “But has anyone tried kicking him? Like kicking him so hard in the back he spins a bit and becomes unstuck?”“I was kicking him but it didn't work” said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.“We have to destroy the walls and then he’ll have room to become unstuck” Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stated. She then pulled out the hammer and sickle she always carries and started to attack the hallway walls. “Destroy all the walls!”“Can’t we just step over him?” suggested Senator Ted Cruz.“You can’t step over the president!” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer responded. “It’s disrespectful.”“What if we built a stairway over him?” Senator Bernie Sanders asked. “I bet we could do it for under $300 billion.”“How are we supposed to pass a $300 billion stairway project if we can’t get to the Senate chambers where I store my gavel ya dumb-dumb?” shot back Schumer.“We have to face facts” declared Vice-President Kamala Harris grimly. “The only way we’re going to free up the hallway is to blow up Biden with dynamite.”“That was your suggestion when he wouldn’t budge on the minimum wage!” said Schumer.If Biden continues to be stuck politicians fear that so many spending bills will now be blocked that the country could start to lose its deficit setting a dangerous precedent.

How can we help you today?" said Kyle Barton drive-thru manager as he arrived. "Oh golly gee! It looks like ya got stuck there! We're on it!" The Chick-fil-A workers got to work humming praise songs as they went and got the ship unstuck in no time. Then they worked with Suez Canal authorities to streamline the process of moving ships through the canal identifying hundreds of inefficiencies and ways to improve the customer experience of shipping containers through the important trade route.Now according to sources every ship captain and crew member will receive a complimentary chicken sandwich large waffle fry and frozen lemonade at the end of the journey."It's my pleasure" said Barton as he whistled for his crew and they took off back to America to solve the national debt crisis.

We just didn't want to say anything until it was convenient.Here they are:1. The filibuster - We've covered this. But the filibuster is a tool of white supremacy because it is hurting our chances to push our agenda. Really anything that stands in our way is probably racist.2. Having just nine seats on the Supreme Court - Anything short of having 156 seats all Democrats is racist.3. Rice Krispies mascots Snap and Pop (but not Crackle) - Crackle seems alright. But those other two have always been a little sus.4. The keto diet - The only people who ever post about doing keto are white women. So it's racist.5. Opposing segregation - If you oppose segregated graduations schools or drinking fountains you're a racist. It's always been this way. We just didn't speak up until this moment.6. Zoom meetings - We must banish these forever because they're uh racist. That's it.7. Asking for ID - Asking for ID for anything from voting to buying alcohol is racist. But not buying guns. That's just common sense.8. Microsoft Zune - The Zune is racist and it's a good thing it was canceled. Though we do miss playing Hexic.9. Schrödinger's cat - Simultaneously racist and not racist. We're not sure.10. Having a dream that one day people will be judged not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character - This is probably the most racist thing on this list.Check these things out and if you enjoy or even tolerate any of them remember the true racist was inside you all along.

It’s as bad as a box of Uncle Ben’s rice. Maybe even as bad as the white supremacist concept of punctuality.”Not that long ago Democrats constantly used the filibuster and both President Biden and President Barack Obama gave impassioned speeches in defense of the filibuster but this week it has been revealed to be super-duper racist as it wound up on the daily list of “Things We Now Consider Racist But Also Always Considered Racist But Just Didn’t Say Anything Until Now” next to Scrappy from Scooby-Doo the word “thrombosis” and the color aquamarine.“The filibuster has always felt so racist and so oppressive” said woke activist Keith Martin. “We just hadn’t alerted anyone about it until recently because of all the other really racist things we had to tell everyone about like the Dr. Seuss book Beyond Zebras and you know that syrup and jumping jacks.” Martin looked confused for a moment. “I think jumping jacks are on the racist list.” Martin started going through the printed-out list of racist things and the paper was large enough to fill a room. “I’m sure I saw that in here somewhere.”Activists are urging the Senate to move against the filibuster immediately as there will be at least five million more things declared racist tomorrow that will also need to be handled.

"It is harder to register to vote in Hyrule than it is to get the Master Sword. Mostly that's because we're a monarchy.

So I’m like “Well what kind of work is she doing?” Now she's got purple hair like some character from one of those Japanese cartoons perverts watch so probably not one of them office jobs you’d have a lady do like HR or something. Maybe she’s a nurse. Are they now paying male nurses more? Frankly I prefer lady nurses so I hope not.But then I find out she’s a soccer player. And now I’m on her side. You are absolutely right lady. You should get paid exactly the same as your male counterparts: absolutely nothing.Who is paying people to play some boring Commie sport? Shouldn’t they get paid in a bowl of borscht or something? I mean we have all these real sports in the U.S.: Football. Baseball. Basketball. Hockey (I guess). Who is instead giving money to watch European kicky ball? “I don’t want to watch anyone score; I just want to watch people pass for five hours.” I hope anyone like that is on an FBI watchlist or why does that even exist?But what really creeps me out is that there is somehow money for women’s soccer -- the less good version of the world’s most boring sport. What nefarious things are going on there? If some guy went up to my wife Eustice and said “Hey dollface I’ll pay you money to watch you kick around a ball” that weirdo would be spitting out his teeth as soon as I found out. I guess the only consolation is that it’s a small amount of money meaning this country hasn’t gone completely crazy.So you’re right Miss Rapinoe. You should get paid the same as men to play soccer -- a big fat zero. All funds for soccer should be seized by the government because there ain’t nothing good going on there. And that money should instead go to a real sport like football -- one we don’t let women play so women’s pay is never an issue.

Thankfully politicians always strive for their actions to be consistent with their words and Biden is no exception [satire]. And so he announced his resignation today."Women can do everything better than men especially presidenting" Biden said at his formal resignation ceremony Thursday.

Trump volunteered to stand in-person on display until the museum could find a way to safely return the figure for public worship.

"Under the previous administration there were thousands of news stories a day on the poor conditions of the migrants at the border. Under Biden that number is way way lower."Estimates suggest that whereas there was a steady stream of reports about bad conditions inept government action and inhumane handling of migrants who had crossed the border Biden has "built a wall" around the information coming from the border so that the influx of news stories has all but stopped."As Biden continues to expertly handle the crisis of media coverage we expect the number of news stories to be reduced down to Obama administration levels in no time" Psaki said proudly."But what about the kids in cage--" one Newsmax reporter began only for Psaki to pull a handle and send him plummeting through a trap door.

President Biden eventually exited the plane via a hydraulic lift rather than the traditional staircase.White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked if the new parking permit had anything to do with the President’s recent fall on the stairs of Air Force One. “Absolutely not" Psaki said. “The President slipped because he was hit with a hurricane-force wind burst caused by global warming. There was also some uh fried chicken grease left over from the Trump administration that made the steps extra slippery.”Psaki said the addition of the handicap parking pass was actually due to Biden’s exceptional physical condition. “President Biden is so fit and virile his staff has trouble keeping up with him” Psaki explained. “Using a lift slows him down a bit so his security detail has time to catch up.”Psaki then noted that the President was given a precautionary physical after his fall and has been given a clean bill of health. “The President is in peak physical and mental health” she said. “He will have no issues discharging the duties of his office for the remaining 3.5 months of his term.”

Fulfilling her Christian duty she has prayed for her enemies that they may find peace with God -- though she’s also made it clear to the Almighty that if He instead wants to use His wrath against them that’s cool too.“We have to love our enemies” Johnson explained. “That means when people are unfair to me or say mean things to me online I need to act with love and grace. Still if God wants to start smiting those people with like thunder or maybe meteors... that’s up to Him.

If You want to start smiting those heathens left and right that’s Your prerogative.”Johnson then read about a new law going after religious liberty and prayed that God would change the hearts of those politicians. And she really meant it because if those politicians were swallowed up by a giant crack in the earth as they deserved they’d probably be replaced by people just as bad in a special election.

"It just doesn't make sense. The pay is pretty good the hours are fantastic and the benefits are great. So anyone who's in the job market should really consider becoming a PSCR.

Biden started gaining on him as his handlers corralled him and pointed him in the right direction but he kept falling over and tumbling down the stairs.It all looked good for Russia until Putin had to stop a few times to sign execution papers for journalists who criticized him squandering his lead.Finally Biden jumped in a stair lift and started to close the gap but it was too little too late and Putin emerged at the top of the 30-step staircase victorious.Well thanks to Biden losing the stair contest we are now part of Russia. We also just want to say that Vladimir Putin is one fine fellow and a fantastic man and he deserved to win and we welcome him as our new leader for life.

What are you? Insane?” She was also ejected from the hospital for being an accessory to not wearing a mask.“Don’t try to argue against mask rules with science or common sense or any of that garbage” said Baker “because it’s not about that.

Was this just a terrible tragedy or was it really... [dramatic pause] ... WHITE SUPREMACY?" The answer of course is almost always white supremacy but we still have to ask.Here are nine disasters from history that were actually motivated by white supremacy:1. The Ice Age - Evil white ice decided to dominate the globe spreading its racist glaciers everywhere. Truly despicable.2. The sinking of the Titanic - Just when we thought the white ice was defeated white supremacy sunk the Titanic killing 1500 people.3. That time the Starbucks barista got your order wrong - When you asked for skim milk and they gave you 2% that was a clear example of white supremacy at work.4. D-Day - Evil white men from America Canada Britain and various other predominantly white countries attacked Germany oppressively implying that their moral values weren't as good as the white man's.5. The Eruption of Mount Vesuvius - A lot of people died so probably white supremacy.6. The Fukushima nuclear disaster - An anti-Asian hate crime motivated by white supremacy if ever we've seen one.7. That game of Catan where your friend played as white and totally jacked Longest Road from you and hatefully colonized Catan oppressing the natives and getting ten victory points before you. - Your orange colony of color was just minding its own business when your buddy ruthlessly oppressed you.8. Thanos's snap - Well this one's more purple supremacy but still.9. Anything bad that has ever happened - Finally just to make sure we have all our bases covered anything bad that has ever happened that we missed.What other disasters do you know of that were motivated by white supremacy? Let us know in the comments if you have a Babylon Bee subscription. Or if you're poor just shout at your screen.

It is currently unclear who caused this crisis but some critics are suggesting it may have something to do with all the "Free Stuff Come On In" signs Biden has been hanging on the side of the border wall."For months now Joe Biden has been sneaking down here at night hanging up 'Free Stuff' posters along the border wall" said Amos Gutierrez an ICE agent on the border. "I'm not saying the border surge is Biden's fault or anything but the signs may have something to do with it."Studies show that most migrants are just coming here to work hard and provide for their families but some have shown an increase in people who are just coming here for free stuff-- likely due to the signs."We don't want hard-working self-reliant people coming into the country" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. "We need people who are looking for free stuff so they'll vote for us forever. Did I say that out loud? Good morning! Sunday morning!"Biden has promised to temporarily take down the "Free Stuff" signs until the media can finish their important work of making the crisis disappear.

President Joe Biden recently clarified this issue saying people will be able to stop wearing masks as soon as absolutely everyone “has learned complete obedience to the government.”“Both the federal and local governments have given you lots of different rules” Biden told the press “and all we want is for you to follow them unquestioningly. When people are still saying ‘this rule is arbitrary’ or ‘this doesn’t make any sense with known science’ then you’re still not ready and will have to keep wearing your masks.”Biden further explained that removing mask mandates has nothing to do with how many people are vaccinated or anything else scientific or rational. “This is about demonstrating that you will do whatever we say whenever we say it” Biden said. “When people are still talking about ‘liberty’ then you’re just not ready. When the Constitution is in ashes then you have my permission to die... to take off your mask I mean.”Some reporters tried to ask questions but this only further angered Biden as he had told them there would be no questions and those reporters were forced to double-mask as penance.

"I told Specialist Casey Specialist Smith and Corporal Bradley to carefully park the tanks along the curb over there but I forgot that was a bad idea due to them all being women. Lesson learned I guess."According to witnesses the three women kept moving forward and back again and again while scuffing up the curb and leaning out the hatch to say "sorry" to each other very politely. After smashing several cars and destroying 18 tanks the women finally gave up and left sticky notes on the tanks apologizing to whoever would have to use them next.The corporal and two specialists have since been reassigned to the airfield to park helicopters.

"All my life I have dreamed of eating hot fluffy Aunt Jemima pancakes or sitting down to read my favorite Dr. Seuss book Oh The Places You'll Go!"Juan also told reporters he has always been a die-hard fan of the American football team the Washington Redskins and can't wait to see his favorite team play in person. "I love watching them play!" he said. "Almost as much as I love watching the Cleveland Indians play baseball!"Unfortunately President Biden detained poor Juan at the border and told him to "go back home.""I'm not giving up!" said Juan to reporters.

'March 16th 2021',https://babylonbee.com/news/take-your-sexism-elsewhere-here-are-9-advantages-of-female-soldiers,"Think Women Can't Fight? Here Are 9 Advantages Of Female Soldiers",A lot has been said lately about women serving in combat with some people saying it's not a good idea. Absolutely reprehensible! Here at the Babylon Bee we respect women and value the very important contributions of women in the U.S. Armed Forces.After doing some research we discovered some of the many important advantages to having women in combat. Here are just a few. Read and learn you sexist.1. They can't do as many push-ups which helps the self-esteem of the male soldiers: Seriously-- it's so cute. Women can only do a few push-ups and they have to do lady push-ups like little kids. Can you imagine what would happen to morale if the female soldiers outperformed the men in the push-up department?2. They are always carrying essential oils which can heal any wound: Women are famous for their ability to patch up boo-boos. With essential oils they have found a way to fix literally anything. Medics are now obsolete! Plus they can carry a limitless supply of rations ammo bandages equipment mints and small aircraft in their purse.3. They are very submissive and good at taking orders: Wait-- this can't be true. We need to fact-check this one.4. High heels have a smaller footprint and are thus less likely to set off a land mine: For many years females have endured grueling training to become experts at walking on pointy stilettos-- likely to gain a tactical advantage should they ever encounter a minefield.5. They don’t throw grenades well so the enemy will never know what to expect: Female soldiers usually throw like girls. It really throws the bad guys off-- sending them diving in the wrong direction and completely embarrassing themselves in front of your female soldiers.6. They make your forward operating base smell really good with their perfume and cookie baking: A military base without women just smells like dirt and farts. A woman's touch just makes life better. Plus all those throw pillows make driving a tank more comfortable!7. Women are one-third the size of men making them a much smaller target: Whenever there are women scampering around on the battlefield it drives terrorist snipers crazy because they're near impossible to hit.8. They can replenish numbers by giving birth: Women soldiers have a magical ability to make more soldiers easily replacing the casualties from your last battle. However we're told men can get pregnant now too though so maybe this ain't so special.9. You can pay them way less which gives you more money for weapons and ammo: We're not sure why they're cool with this. We can only conclude women just don't care about money as much. Either way it's great because that frees up more money to buy cool stuff like tanks and machine guns!We hope you learned a thing or two from this comprehensive list. Now-- go hang your head in shame and maybe try not being so sexist next time.

"Let me see here..."As soon as he opened up the book a massive cloud of dust and debris catapulted off the cover out the window and into the clear Vatican sky."Mamma Mia!" exclaimed several onlookers. "The Holy Father! He's reading the Bible!"The dust continued to rise into the sky obscuring the sun and causing thousands of local residents to gasp for breath."Why didn't he warn us he was going to open the book?" people cried as they scattered in all directions trying to avoid what was now a powerful sandstorm heading their way.The Pope read the book for a while and after determining none of the teachings had changed since he last opened it put it back on the shelf and announced the Catholic church would not be changing its doctrine-- at least until the Pope announces the meanings of the words have changed in light of modern interpretation."Maybe next year" said Francis.

"This isn't what I voted for."According to economists some of Biden's recent executive orders have driven up gas prices. That combined with runaway inflation is projected to increase the cost of filling up an average SUV by a billion-trillion percent.Biden responded quickly to outcries from angry Americans promising to pass yet another even larger stimulus package next month. The next round of checks will provide $6000 for every American and will cover the cost of one fill-up plus a Slurpee and a lotto ticket.The President said he plans to continue sending stimulus checks every month until people "stop whining" or the U.S. dollar collapses whichever comes first.
'March 16th 2021',https://babylonbee.com/news/asians-asked-to-be-less-successful-to-stop-ruining-racial-narrative,"Asians Asked To Be Less Successful To Stop Ruining Racial Narrative",U.S.—There is a long-successful narrative about race in this country: Racism of the past has led to structural racism which keeps minorities from being successful. It seems really really true but one group continually causes problems for that narrative: Asians.Asians in the U.S. have faced terrible discrimination in the past and continue to face discrimination today and yet they continue to do even better academically and financially than white people -- the bad race that oppresses everyone. Woke activists are trying to put an end to this with a campaign urging Asians to be less successful so the simple racial narrative can prevail.“It’s really inconsiderate” said activist Howard Morrison a white person who prides himself on caring more about racial issues than even most minorities. “No minority is supposed to be able to succeed until all white people learn to check their privilege. If minorities are successful anyway it gets harder to guilt white people and just makes things more difficult for everyone.”The new campaign is called “You’re Not Allowed to Succeed Yet.” It’s specifically aimed at Asians but also applies to any minority doing well before structural racism is ended. The campaign has a phone number to report any successful minority who will then be educated on how important it is that minorities wait for white people to fix things before any of them do well. A number of top universities have already signed on to the campaign and are helping out by limiting the number of Asians they admit.

"Do not be led astray by strange and diverse teachings" He went on to say obviously indifferent to the pain his close-minded words were causing."It's inexcusable that God has refused to update his views to keep in step with our changing cultural norms" said one local man whose views have changed 23 times in the last 10 years. "He hasn't even updated his holy book in 2000 years! Let's move on already!"When pressed for comment on whether he has plans to update his written word any time soon The Almighty simply replied saying "All flesh is like grass and all its glory like the flowers of the field. The grass withers and the flowers fall but the word of the Lord stands forever."Scholars have roughly translated this to mean: "Nah-- I'm good."

When you think about it that way what Cain did was quite an accomplishment."Some scholars took issue with this new way of looking at the first murder since killing people is generally frowned upon by most cultures but environmentalists were quick to point out that there weren't any laws against killing people when the killing happened."Can we really even say Cain did anything wrong? There were no laws on the books at the time" said Pedersen."When you look at the exponential growth of the human race offing Abel may have delayed the climate catastrophe by thousands of years!"Bernie Sanders quickly seized on the conversation introducing new legislation to allow hitting people with rocks until carbon emissions are reduced by 25%.

But if I say I’m offended no one cares. Sometimes they laugh at me. So I don’t even bring it up anymore. I just have to keep it all to myself like some sort of weirdo.”Johnston has noticed it’s very different with other groups since charges of offending someone are usually met with a swift and decisive response. People will often take drastic actions when no one was even offended and people only imagined someone could be offended.“It's not fair!” Johnston stated. “But it also kind of seems like my offense might be a big burden to place on everyone else just because of what I believe.”At that moment a woman passing by yelled "BOO HOO! CRY MORE WHITE MALE!" before throwing a milkshake at him.Johnston has tried to use his experience at being offended to help others once trying to instruct a woman who said she was offended on how to deal with that offense without forcing others to change but everyone looked at him like he was Hitler.

Sad. Not good! But you need to buck up because there are a lot of great career choices for you that can leverage your unique skills as a reporter and a destroyer of people's lives.Try your hand at one of these seven trades and you're sure to land on your feet in no time:1. A programmer. We're absolutely not telling you to learn to code because that would be hate speech. But we might be suggesting you acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to develop and program software for computers and other electronic devices. MAYBE.2. Learn to build solar panels. Sucks that your job got cut. But look at it as a positive: you can just pivot to building solar panels. Always gotta look on the bright side.3. Official spokesperson for the Chinese government. You've got lots of experience in this already! China is probably hiring.4. An essential worker. Do something actually essential for society like driving for UberEats or DoorDash. You'll contribute a lot more to society than ever before!5. Just cut out the middle man and go mob people in their homes directly. You have a lot of experience doxxing people in hopes of riling up a mob to take them down. Why not get your hands dirty and just go attack people in their homes yourself? Cut out the middle man!6. Take a gap year and search through old tweets for old time's sake. You don't need to jump right into a new career. Take your severance pay and spend a year looking for bad tweets people posted a decade ago just for old time's sake.7. Try your hand at writing hilarious satire. Your pieces in HuffPo already read like satire -- why not just keep writing the exact same kind of pieces but label them as satire? As a parody of terrible woke journalism it just might work!Good luck -- it can be brutal out there!

I would hate if anything were to happen to you before you got the chance to tell your truth" he said.

The award honors an individual who does a great job at ensuring that thousands more children and vulnerable Central American and Mexican residents will be smuggled across the border each and every day. The cartel cited Biden's immigration policies and disastrous handling of the border crisis as key factors in their decision to give the award to him once again."El Presidente Biden es muy bueno!" said one narco as he handed Biden the plaque. "We thank you Mr. President for your lax border policies and promises of free money for migrants that are allowing us to smuggle them across the border in record numbers. You are truly a friend to the cartel." The drug kingpin then pulled out his revolver and fired it into the air a custom that represents bestowing honor and praise upon an individual in the cartel community -- usually reserved for drug dealers who have an exceptionally good month.Biden thanked them for the award and then got his phone out to play "Despacito" in their honor.

Then he's probably been radicalized by alt-right personalities on YouTube.No hair which is a common Neo-Nazi hairstyle: Is your baby a skinhead? Having no hair is a colossal red flag. If your newborn is bald make him wear a wig until his hair grows in.Enjoys bedtime stories written by notorious racist Dr. Seuss: Books by Dr. Seuss are a gateway drug to literally burning crosses in people's front yards. Teach your child to burn those books instead.Shows his white fragility by crying all the time: Crying is a sure sign of defensiveness and fear of honest conversations around race. Not good!Refuses to say "black lives matter": Seriously-- what's so hard about saying "black lives matter"? If instead he says things like "goo goo ga ga" this is even more troubling.

That’s when a child is placed inside a cage and then that cage is put inside of a second larger cage.“According to our studies” said CDC researcher Edmund Fisher “double-caging increases the effectiveness of child detention by at least 25%. That’s too large a factor to ignore.”The CDC also reiterated that the caging of children should be done both indoors and outside with proper distancing between the cages.Progressive groups who had reacted with alarm to children being caged under the Trump administration also pushed back against this CDC recommendation. “What are we Nazi Germany?” said left-wing activist Shaun Craig. “Are we really so stingy that we are only giving children two cages? It seems like three cages would work even better and make sure those kids could never escape.”Border Patrol though is not so convinced. “We don’t have a lot of extra cages for this” said Border Patrol agent Anne Wheeler. “Where are we supposed to get all these cages?” They were assured though by the Biden administration that nearly half of the funds from the $1.9 trillion stimulus package that no one read will go towards purchasing more cages.

That’s 39 companies where the men were so lazy and incompetent that a woman -- a woman -- had to step up and run the company for them.What is wrong with people? Don’t they know women have enough to do? They have to raise the children clean the house make me a sandwich -- and now on top of all that they need to run multi-billion-dollar companies? Think of the ladies people. Think of the ladies!The problem we have here -- as in most things -- is a failure of men to be men. Men ain’t wearing a proper hat. Some of them think they’re women (and they get real angry if you tell them they ain’t -- one bit me!). And men aren’t running their own companies because it isn’t “metrosexual” or whatnot.So now we have a problem where all our precious beautiful ladies are forced into the business world to do what men won’t. Did you know that the average CEO makes 320 times as much as a regular employee? What’s a woman even going to do with all that money? She’ll need to buy another house to hold all her shoes. That’s a world gone crazy.So the next time you see a lady try to be a CEO you say to her “No. That’s okay. You sit and rest your feet and have a cup of tea. I’ll run this company for you.” That’s how we treated women back in my day when everyone’s heads were screwed on straight.

Unacceptable. Marvin the Martian for blackface: How how how is this even acceptable in 2021? I don't care if you're an alien from Mars. Blackface is unacceptable no matter who you are or what planet you're from. And don't even get us started on the harmful portrayal of foreign aliens.Elmer Fudd for an ableist portrayal of people with speech impediments: Why does the only Looney Tunes character with a serious speech impediment also have to be an incompetent idiot who can never catch the "pesky wabbit?" We're not laughing. Not at all. Daffy Duck who is not voiced by a person of color: Seriously- he's a black duck and he talks like a lispy white guy from New Jersey. Not on our watch. Porky Pig who is clearly a cop: Now is not the time for sympathetic police officer characters. Thanks but no thanks. Take your systemic oppression elsewhere. Speedy Gonzalez for cultural appropriation of Roadrunner: His stereotypical Mexican features are fine. His real offense is being a blatant copy of Roadrunner wearing his culture like a cheap sombrero.Lola Bunny for setting unrealistic beauty standards for furry cosplay nerds: How is your average female cosplay artist supposed to compete with that?Tweety Bird who uses racial profiling in looking for threats: Oh you taw a puddy-tat did you? Check your prejudice you bigoted bird.Hugo the Abominable Snowman an all-white character: Do we not have enough white characters already? On the plus side he is called "abominable" so maybe he can stay as a reminder of white abominableness.Time for all of these characters to go. Maybe then we can begin healing. That's all folks!

"I don't know why people are trying to cancel him. Pepe is an upstanding example of how men should treat women. Mmmm women. I learned a lot from Pepe.

After spending most of the day fighting to have certain books banned and trying to stop unfettered free speech he wound down by accusing those opposed to him of being Nazis.“There’s just so much to do” Garner said. “There are all these books no one should be allowed to read and yet bookstores keep selling them. And then people say lots of dangerous unregulated things and it all needs to be taken offline. But of course we have these Nazis against such things saying ‘People should be able to buy whatever books they like and say what they think.’ Typical Nazi rhetoric.”The situation has gotten so dire that Garner has sometimes turned to destruction of property and attacking people to get his way. “We have to stop all this problematic stuff by whatever means necessary. But you know what Nazis think of political violence. They hate it.”Garner worries that there are too many Nazis out there -- probably because they didn’t ban books and regulate speech quickly enough. He’s starting to wonder if the only way to fight them will be to round them up and reeducate them. “Of course I can hear those Nazis now” he added. “‘You can’t round people up into camps.’ Those Nazis are the worst.”

Sometimes I just sit around and wait for a notification to pop up on my phone with the latest government advisory on how many masks I should wear if I should get the vaccine and whether I should wear pants."Progressives across the state however began to grow worried that they would now have to start to make their own decisions about their health. What's worse they would have to take responsibility for their actions when it comes to where they go whether or not they mask and whether or not they social distance."If the government doesn't force me to wear a mask how will I ever make my own decisions about what's best for me and my health?

We express our deepest apologies and hope our oversight about Hitler has not contributed to racial violence against the Chinese.”Other major distributors quickly followed suit with Amazon additionally stopping all sales of chopsticks to people with Asian-sounding names. After seeing what corporations were doing the Biden administration bravely denounced Hitler’s drawing and said it will be issuing executive orders imposing restrictions on Chinese restaurants so no one will ever be exposed to the harmful sight of an actual Chinese person eating with chopsticks.Journalists questioned if there might also be problematic text in Mein Kampf but Biden explained that “unlike a cartoon putting people in camps and committing genocide is simply a different cultural norm! We’ve got to understand that President Xi needs to bring unity by doing lots of the same things that Hitler did and we can’t be out there acting like he might order people’s torture while eating with chopsticks. That’s racism systemic kung pao!

In every case the researchers claim book burners never went beyond their original targets. They couldn't find even a single time that destroying a few books led to banning and destroying even more books. Therefore they say we're totally in the clear when people start destroying Dr. Seuss books because they'll never move beyond those into more important things."Don't worry folks -- they'll definitely just stop with a couple of books" said the head researcher of the study Dr. Christopher Lyleson. "They usually find a couple of really problematic ones from decades ago and just stop there their hunger to destroy information and opinions satiated. It's really an important societal service to occasionally purge the older works of one or two toxic books. But it always stops there as far as we can tell.""So rest easy!"Unfortunately the study was found to be problematic and has been burned.

He will start making public appearances again as soon as it’s once more OK to harass women and make casually racist remarks -- or at least OK for a Democrat.

We just do. That's how things are" said Biden. "We have all these extra bombs lying around collecting dust and we have to drop them on those people over there who -- as intelligence is telling us -- are bad people. They're bad people folks! Gotta bomb 'em!""But we're gonna purchase all our future bombs from some clean articulate black business owners who make bombs. It's just the right thing to do" he continued.Unfortunately it was later discovered that there are no black business owners in the country who make bombs for the U.S. military. "Ah man-- that's too bad" said Biden before canceling his meeting with Al Sharpton.

All of them conveniently have the same charger port which is nice since despite each of the devices coming with its own charger they still only have one.Their count of chargers has remained the same no matter how many new devices packaged with a charger they buy. The family passes the charger around from room to room getting involved in a daily passive-aggressive cold war over who gets to charge their smartphone or tablet. One family member will plug in their phone only to find that minutes later a crafty sibling has snuck into their room and absconded with the charger hiding it in a secure location no one will ever find."Has anybody seen the charger!?" Mr. Gary Braxton yelled last night frustrated as someone had moved it from his side of the bed again. "I specifically moved it right here and told nobody to touch it! AGGGGGGGGGH!!!"His wife hid silently in the guest room next door hoping he would not discover her as she was charging her phone.Mr. Braxton finally caved and purchased a 24-pack of chargers on Amazon but they all had disappeared at publishing time.

But let's just start with these nine for now:1. Horton Hears a Who -- This Seuss book hasn't been canceled yet but it sure needs to be. The book claims a person is a person no matter how small showing that Seuss hates women's rights and wants to control their bodies.2. Chicka Chicka Boom Boom -- Prominently features the letter "Q."3. Every Berenstain Bears book -- These books perpetuate the idea of a nuclear family with traditional values. They also appropriated furry culture.4. Clifford the Big Red Dog -- He’s literally a dog whistle for far-right neo-Nazi extremists and their affinity to the color red.5. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory -- Teaches kids there should be consequences for bad behavior without even considering the child's race ethnicity or history of being oppressed.6. The Very Hungry Caterpillar -- This book encourages kids to consume and consume destroying the environment for their own personal gain.7. Goodnight Moon -- Honestly it's probably not racist but if we have to read this book to our kids one more time we're gonna die.8. The Jungle Book -- Insensitive and stereotypical of Indian culture. Mowgli is called "man-cub" and don't even get us started on that loaded term. How has this not been canceled already?9. If You Give A Mouse A Cookie -- Teaches kids about cause and effect-- which as we all know from corporate anti-racism training is an aspect of white culture not shared by other people groups.10. The Tuttle Twins -- Free markets? Individual responsibility? American history? Are you kidding? Where do we even start? We literally can't even with this one.11. The Little Engine That Could -- Implies that hard work and effort can help you overcome challenges which is pretty tone-deaf considering oppressed groups aren't able to benefit from hard work.12. Genderqueer Marxist Baby -- Actually this one seems fine.Get out the kerosene if you love your children.NOT SATIRE: The Tuttle Twins children's book series is teaching the rising generation about the ideas of freedom free markets individual responsibility and American history.

Too many ridiculous liberal ideas have already been proposed. This must end. It’s time to open Texas 100%.”Governor Abbott continued “We believe that by removing the mask requirement that all of the Californians will flee in terror restoring our state to its former glory. As soon as they see the joy and hear the laughter of our citizens returning to normal life they’ll be sure to pack up and leave at once.”The Governor has strategically placed “No Masks Required” stickers on all Texas state signs warning all who enter of what lies beyond. He has expressed hope that this will send any namby-pamby who reads it back around to where they came from. “We tried buying and carrying more guns around but somehow that didn't work. Then we tried driving around in big lifted gas-guzzling trucks but they still kept coming. But now by removing our masks for good Texas can finally start to heal.”After seeing immediate results by reversing the mask mandate Governor Abbott has been looking for more ways to scare off the cry-baby cowards.

Recently I saw womxn Latinx and folx. What is that? Klingon?If I even try to read what them crazy Marxists write these days I think I’m having a stroke. It’s just insane gibberish and I’m not sure how to pronounce half of it. Do they even know what they’re saying? Or is this like baby babble where they’re trying to imitate speech with their nonsense?Back in my day when people knew what men and women were everyone worked hard and we didn’t have time for silliness because we were too worried about the Commies nuking us we only spoke actual words that meant things. If someone walked up to you and said “Hello womxn. How is your intersectionality?” they would grab that person off the street and lock him up in the crazy house. And then shock his brain until he started making sense again.But we don’t have common sense like that anymore. Instead we got them “progressives” running around jibbering in their incomprehensible made-up language like Jodie Foster in that one movie (You know which one? It was a while ago.

And then when anybody tries to replace a vowel with an ‘x’ you just lock them up in there and start shocking their brain.You know what that’s called? Compassion.

His pages were literally dripping with racism or maybe that was just the barbecue sauce for our chicken nuggies. Even so barbecue sauce might be racist too now that we think of it.Take this Dr. Seuss page out of Oh the Thinks You Can Think!. It looks harmless yeah? Well you're just showing your internalized racism because there are literally 17 different examples of racism packed into this illustration. Come on a journey with us as we explore them all.1. The giant orange beast is obviously a reference to Donald Trump. This glorifies white supremacy and Nazism as Seuss was alluding to his allegiance to the bad orange man.2. The pink boot squashing the poor little dude glorifies fascism. A little too obvious there Führer Seuss.3. The text implies it's OK to go to the Right. Like COME ON! In a children's book?4. Zoom in on the tuba. Keep zooming. Keeeeep zooming: IT'S A TINY HITLER OH MY GOODNESS! Hard to believe Seuss snuck this one past the editors.5. The smoke coming from the machine glorifies the racist classist hierarchies of capitalism that harm the environment and disproportionally people of color. And he made the smoke multiple colors -- just one more slap in the face to POCs.6. The page is rectangular encouraging readers to think inside the box of capitalist propaganda and not become woke to the struggle of the classes. Straight lines and boundaries are signs of non-wokeness. Plus the shape is eerily similar to the shape of a Nazi flag!7. These four men have Hitler mustaches. Seuss was brainwashing kids to worship Hitler! How can we have these books at schools?8. What color is the page? You guessed it! WHITE! Gee what a coincidence!9. If you trace this blank space and kinda squint your eyes a little it looks like a swastika. Other parts of the page look like ancient Norse runes that are definitely associated with Nazism.10. There are 35 different creatures on the page. 35 X 2.514285714285714 = 88 a well-known dog-whistle for Nazism.11. The little mouse dude is carrying a key to go lock up kids in cages. Sorry - migrant detention facilities.12. The roller coaster forms an "H" for "Hitler." It could possibly also mean "Hey racism is awesome!" Either way it's garbage.13. The unicycle has one wheel representing the supremacy of a single race. Couldn't be more obvious.14. The name of the book is Oh the Thinks You Can Think! which implies that thinking for yourself about race is good. First kids will be reading Dr. Seuss books the next thing you know they'll be watching Jordan Peterson videos.15. The white musician is playing his racist banjo while literally being pulled by slaves. We can't believe Dr. Seuss snuck in his love for the Antebellum South into this children's book. Wait -- actually we can.16. An alligator is pulling a tuba player and alligators come from Florida with Florida being the name of the mother from Good Times best known for a character who shouted "Dy-no-mite!" with dynamite being an invention of Alfred Nobel making this an obvious commentary on how there needs to be a Nobel Prize for Music which I guess isn't super racist except that Sweden is full of white people. Sometimes pointing out racist imagery can feel like a stretch but not this one. Seuss wasn't even trying to hide it here.17. Perhaps worst of all the creatures of different colors are getting along with each other and aren't segregated. Ideally the creatures would all be mad at each other for being different colors. They're clearly not woke enough.Well there are probably dozens more but we have to go scream at some Nazis. You know what you have to do owners of Dr. Seuss books: go rip them out of your children's hands and burn them! Then come back here to the comment section and tell us more racist symbols you found on this page!

Weird.”According to sources some Christians tried nominating Kirk Cameron but the Golden Globes Committee thought giving him the award would just make all the other actors look bad and create an impossible standard to live up to. Moving forward the "Not Being A Pervert" award will likely be shelved until a time when there is a cultural moral revolution within Hollywood.Desperate to find a new way to keep viewers interested the team at the Golden Globes is considering some other categories that may be more relevant such as "Most Oppressed Celebrity" "Biggest Political Activist Acting As An Actor" and "Obama’s Favorite Actor."

While most people are celebrating this development it has filled others with worry -- especially those who have taken it upon themselves to yell at people who aren’t wearing masks. They have a sinking feeling they’re never going to feel important ever again.“I’ve never felt so alive as when I’ve gotten in people’s faces saying ‘Where’s your mask?! Where’s your mask?!’” said Karen Hughes. “I’m basically stopping murderers. And let’s face it with my lack of skills and annoying personality this is the highlight of my life.”“This has given me purpose and meaning” agreed Karen Boyd. “Usually I’m looked at as some sort of witch when I scream at kids but now I have a reason backed by the CDC. I’m a hero. But when the pandemic is over I’ll go back to being a crazy lady.”“I don’t think I have the ability to do anything else” said Bob “Karen” Shelton. “What else can I yell at people about? ‘Wear sunscreen?!’ I dunno. And I was just getting so good at mask policing. I was yelling at people for only wearing one mask. ‘Why don’t you have two?!’ I‘d shout. But those days are ending.”The mask-yellers do have some hope that masks will become a habit during flu season which at least gives them an annual reason to harass random passersby.

CHUG!"The epic reading of 6 weeks' worth of Tweets Trump never got to send: He did this for the first 45 minutes of his speech.Revealing he's been working out: Trump showed off a new toned body from 6 weeks of increased golf activity.Trump's announcement that he has grown an army of Uruk-Hai warriors in spawning pits beneath Trump Tower: Get ready for a red wave!Firing $2000 checks into the audience with a cannon: Trump proved he's better than Sleepy Joe at keeping campaign promises with a GIANT MONEY CANNON!When Trump invited weeping Biden voters to come forward and repent: Thousands of liberals were consumed with guilt after being deceived by Sleepy Joe. As the soft piano chords of a Lee Greenwood song played many came forward to surrender their vote to Trump.Unfortunately enthusiasm was cut short after Biden won the CPAC straw-poll by 138000 votes.

Isn’t that right Kelly?”Cuomo went on to explain how some of his sexual jokes may not have landed with the women since they couldn’t see his facial expressions. He also claimed that the women may have misheard him since his words were muffled by his mask and they were standing so far apart.“Do I regret making those comments?” Cuomo asked as he stood up to leave the press conference. “No. Now if you’ll excuse me I’ve got some strip poker er-- I mean poker to play.”

We’re being bombed again!” said a Syrian fleeing bombs.Biden seems to have really appreciated the gesture of Obama handing over his Nobel Peace Prize though Obama had to keep telling Biden it wasn’t chocolate as Biden kept sticking it in his mouth.

Joe Hasbro finally caved and agreed to remove the super-macho action hero from store shelves."Now you know your gender identity -- and knowing is half the battle!" shouts an actor playing G.I. Pat in a commercial for the new toy as he struggles to light a Molotov cocktail and picks up a brick with the utmost effort. "Now let's go murder some cops!"G.I. Pat comes with a Molotov cocktail a brick and a cute miniature copy of The Communist Manifesto. You can accessorize your G.I. Pat with genderless clothes androgynous accessories and fun equipment like smartphones that just play asinine TikTok videos and social justice lectures all day for your miniature action hero.Conservatives immediately complained on social media screaming that losing G.I. Joe would signal the end of the Republic. Hasbro then flip-flopped caving to conservatives and announcing G.I. Joe would be made even more masculine under the new brand "MISTER HE-MAN G.I. JOE MURDER YOUR FACE ARMY MAN."

As of today the libs are released from his authority and are free to make illogical arguments based on feelings rather than facts. The political commentator and media host says he expects to own more libs in the future but for now he will let them all go.“It’s a hard practice to obey” said Shapiro. “But when we understand the mercy of God we can’t help but act in obedience and pass that mercy on to others.”In addition to granting the libs freedom he has also returned gallons and gallons of leftist tears to their rightful owners paying them back fourfold. Dividing the tears and tracking down their owners was a challenging feat marked by perseverance and kindheartedness.“It’s only fair that I give them back” Shapiro said of the tears. “I’m sure I’ll be able to fill these tumblers back up in no time.”Shapiro made a number of other comments explaining his decision but spoke so quickly that our reporters were unable to understand him. We’re pretty sure they were all good reasons.

That’s when you say something so true those liberals get all huffy and try to get you fired from your job. Of course I’m not scared about that. For one thing I’m retired. And even if they try to cut off my social security I’ll just live in the woods and eat squirrels and whatnot. I don’t care. So good ole Frank is just going to keep saying what he thinks.What I do not care for though is being slandered. And that’s what happened when I was accused of being a part of cancel culture for saying we should throw commies out of a helicopter. Well let’s just say the guy who said such things about me is lucky he is safely behind a keyboard or he would have fared no better than a squirrel in the woods.Let me educate you: Throwing commies out of helicopters is not the same thing as cancel culture. For one thing commies are not human. Science in the ‘80s proved this -- that’s real science before it got all woke and removed the X and Y chromosomes from biology and made up global warming. When the bad ideas of communism infect your brain you lose all humanity and become something less than human: a commie. And that science also proved that commies are only good for two things: strangling and being thrown from high places.Now again these are just facts. And yet I got kicked off the Twitters for saying this because it was “violent.” Now that’s canceling. Commies killed over 100 million people last century and yet they’re all worried about little ole Frank who just wants to strangle a few people. That’s messed up priorities. That’s why the world is in such bad shape and everyone is hatless.Anyway it’s all just theoretical. That’s because my helicopter tour business got shut down because of the “accidents.” There’s more canceling for you!

Kids were seen running and hopping around punching trees digging holes with their hands and even punching farm animals in the face in hopes of acquiring various resources."These kids are very susceptible to influence from video games at this age" said the state lawmaker. "This rise in violence against trees appears to come from the popular video game Minecraft. Kids who are dumb and can't distinguish reality from these so-called 'video games' play the games and then go outside and replicate exactly what they were doing in the virtual world. They punch wood. Then they stack up wood in a T formation to try to make a pickaxe. Then they take that pickaxe -- which doesn't work very well by the way -- and try to mine stone and then iron and then gold and then diamond and the next thing you know the precious gemstone market is flooded and the world economy collapses and we're all living in a Communist state lining up for bread.""All because of video games."At publishing time sources had also confirmed that a group of kids influenced by popular video game Among Us had launched a spacecraft into orbit and were violently throwing each other out the airlock.

Everyone needs a chance to demonstrate this by kissing Trump’s ring and then groveling before him about their failure to stop the Democrats from stealing the 2020 election.”The CDC asked if there could be a compromise such as having everyone just lie prostrate before Trump to show their loyalty to him but CPAC will not budge.

They're all having fun trying to mask unmask social-distance then not social-distance and perform a variety of contradictory instructions until one of them fails to put on a seventh mask in time and is cast out of the family for being anti-science per the game's instruction manual. "You just got Faucied!" the rest of the family says in glee as the young daughter packs her bags."Sorry -- that's just FAUCI SAYS!"Dr. Fauci lent his voice talents to the game for a more realistic feel. Many of the commands are taken right from actual press conferences and interviews from the time he told Americans to stop wearing masks to the time he told them to wear masks for the next few years. Hasbro says the game is super-relevant and timely and also to be careful because there's a recording device in the game and you'll be reported if you fail to comply with any of the commands.Have fun!

'February 22nd 2021',https://babylonbee.com/news/7-ways-you-can-be-less-white,"7 Ways You Can Be Less White",More and more corporations are requiring their employees to be less white in an attempt to stop racism forever. But it's hard to know how to do that since at first blush that SEEMS really racist and impossible. But it's not. It's actually really easy if you follow these seven simple steps:1. Burn all your Live Laugh Love signs. This is the first step to renouncing whiteness. Find every last "Live Laugh Love" sign in your home every "Too Blessed To Be Stressed" trinket and every "All I Need Is A Little Bit Of Coffee And A Whole Lot Of Jesus" mug and burn them as you think about your inherently sinful whiteness.2. Rip off your skin. This is an easy one!3. Kill yourself. Even easier! For best results rip off your skin then kill yourself.4. Announce that you identify as a person of color. Wait never mind. This one might be cultural appropriation. You also might be mistaken for a conservative trying to come up with a third joke.5. Throw out all your ranch dressing. Ranch dressing mayo -- it's all gotta go.6. Take dance classes. This is a hard step but it's worth it. As you learn to dance to a beat your whiteness will begin to melt away.7. Hate yourself every waking moment until you have sufficiently atoned for your whiteness. Oops! Spoiler alert: you'll never sufficiently atone for your whiteness. Better go back to step 3.There you go! Racism ended forever!

I never made a secret about this neither. I despise them with their soft hands and their useless book-learning. The real way you get to learn things is to get out there and build things with your hands shoot people in a war and have to fend off angry badgers with a shovel. That’s called real knowledge and you only get it by doing real things -- something them college folk don’t know nothin’ about.But now them college dummies are crying about how expensive their useless book-learning was. Now normally I’d just laugh and laugh at them but here’s the crazy thing: They want to use my tax dollars to pay for their college education they never should have got in the first place! I already don’t like most of the things tax dollars pay for but now I’m supposed to pay for a bunch of dummies going to a university to learn how to be commies?Well I ain’t heartless. Yeah I guess you can’t pay off that $100000 in debt for your gender studies degree -- on account of you having no useful skills -- so I’ll make you a deal: I will help pay for your dumb college degree but you have to mow my lawn.That’s right. Every week you come out here and you mow my lawn. And you do a good job. Make it nice and even. And you have to do edging too -- oh you better believe you’re going to edge. And then I will put some money toward that college loan you got ‘cause you a nitwit.I can hear them college kids whining now: “But I don’t know how to do any actual work! Can’t I just wave signs and yell at people? Because that’s all I learned from college.” Yeah this is going to hurt if you ain’t never done physical labor before but think of it. Afterward you will have a marketable skill -- lawn mowing. That’s one more marketable skill than your Marxist professors taught you.So it’s time for you college kids to put down your beer bongs and your marijuana joints roll up your sleeves and mow my lawn. And then in about forty years I guess you’ll have paid off that student loan you never wouldn’t have gotten in the first place if you'd had any sense.You’re welcome!

So here at Amazon we wanted to find a way to still involve people in destroying dangerous books like books about chromosomes. Now people from across the globe can join together via Kindle Bonfire around the warm glow of outdated literature.”Amazon has selected a library of objectionable books that users may not read but can burn including all science and history textbooks as well as pretty much anything written before 2018. After picking a few books users will then control an avatar that flings books into the Kindle Bonfire while shouting slogans like “Hate has no home here!” Avatars may then give each other socially distanced air-fives and celebrate the coming peace that always follows an ascendant cultural force burning all dissent.While a few distributors still exist that will sell the books slated for burning Amazon plans to buy those distributors or bash them in with a shovel. The U.S. government has offered to provide any assistance necessary to ensure no small business stands in the way of Amazon blazing the way to utopia.

And while he realizes that his wife is 100% to blame for the family’s tardiness he hasn’t really come up with a nice way to tell her about it. So this Sunday Greg got a little creative and finally solved the issue once and for all.“Sarah takes a REALLY long time getting ready for church” Anderson explained. “So this week I had this brilliant plan which ended up working perfectly: I just told her we were changing it up this week and would be attending the early service at 8am instead of our usual 10:30 spot. When she was finally ready to go at 9:15 I kindly informed her that service had been delayed until 10:30.”This gave the Andersons plenty of spare time and they ended up strolling into church a whole 30 seconds early.What's more the spare time gave Greg a few extra minutes to catch the Manchester United soccer match. It was a pretty intense game with lots of big plays on both sides and it ended in a 1-1 tie. On a normal week Greg would’ve been forced to “help Jimmy get his shoes on” or “at least stand up and do something.” He would’ve missed some of those big plays.But not this week. This week his wife was ready to go to church on time.

As soon as the media saw him they were all of them deceived and immediately started apologizing for ever criticizing his trip in the first place."Greetings journalists I'm Governor Andrew Cuomo and I'm here to uh kill some senior citizens!" he said in his best New York-Italian accent. "Just gonna head off to some senior homes and make sure everyone there gets infected and dies. Pay me no heed!""Mamma mia!" he added as reporters rushed to kiss his shoes.The media immediately stopped covering his trip and started writing glowing op-eds about how smart it was of him to leave Texas in the cold. "Really could he do anything braver than travel to Cancun? It was a powerful reminder to all of us that there is light at the end of the tunnel. Besides he's worked so hard. He deserves a rest."He was then given an Emmy.

There are a great many obstacles we must overcome if we are to survive climate change” said Bill Gates. “But this may mean giving up some of the luxuries we love the most. We will all have to substantially reduce our travel fuel expenditures and switch entirely to synthetic meats. Only then do we stand a chance.”Mr. Gates stressed how we will all have to put all of our resources together if we really want to make a difference. “I wanted a 500ft 1 billion-dollar mega yacht but I settled for this clunker just to show how committed I am to the cause” said Mr. Gates as he left his onboard 5-star spa. “If we go just 15 years without cars burning fossil fuels and we all eat bugs we can reverse the damage to our planet.”Bill Gates was excited to announce the first of its kind hydrogen-powered engine onboard the Aqua. “There’s truly nothing like it.

Press Secretary Jen Psaki reported that today President Biden sat down with the top experts in the world to figure out which unions have the most money and then unapologetically follow the science of those unions.“What people don’t understand about science is that a lot of it has to do with how much money you make and how many votes you control” explained Jen Psaki. “The scientific method is an objective way to find the truth. We simply hypothesize how much money a union will give us and then see how much they actually do. Then we repeat the experiment.”“The results are fascinating. Grocery stores for example are safe from COVID because cashiers don’t make much money and aren’t politically organized. But the virus is extremely dangerous to schools in blue states where the teacher's unions are compulsory and run so well. Science is amazing!”Reporters asked what the administration would say to parents who see teachers not following the CDC recommendation to reopen schools. “We would say that first parents are misunderstanding science. How many votes does the CDC get? And secondly we would love for the parents to form a union and give us money. We can definitely circle back to their ‘science’ then.”When asked about children suffering from being out of school Psaki frowned. “You know our top researchers have looked into that and what we have found is that frankly kids are broke. It’s really shocking how little money they have and how selfish they are with it. Just not the demographic we’re targeting.”

Back in March of 2020 Donald Trump ripped my press pass away from me struggled to rip it in half (he failed miserably) and then tossed it to a staffer who never gave it back to me. All I had done was ask him a simple question about why he wanted transgender people to die.But those painful memories are past-- washed away in the flood of grace and goodness that is the Biden Administration.After arriving at the White House I took a seat in one of the cute little folding chairs that had been set up by our president’s caring staff. I noticed after a moment that President Joe Biden (oh my goodness doesn't it just feel SO GOOD to say that?!) PRESIDENT BIDEN had his German Shepherds Champ and Major out for a little stroll. This in itself was adorable already!Here we have a president who cares so much about animals that he is willing to take a break from all the chaos of being president just to take his dogs on a walk. Heartwarming! If only we had seen glimpses of this kind of behavior over the past four years. But those days are over now aren't they?!?! [chuckle]I was briefly distracted—I think possibly Jen Psaki’s super cute outfit had caught my attention—but when I looked back I noticed Biden’s dog Champ as he took a real good sniff of the earth. I saw him turn around a few times before catching another whiff of grass.And apparently President Biden had noticed too—you know because he’s a kindhearted person and all unlike our previous president! So I looked at President Biden and I kid you not I read his beautiful lips and he said “Hey Champ you gotta go boy? Go ahead. Go wherever you'd like."OMG! ADORABLE!And he did it. Champ dropped literally the most perfect dog turd I have ever seen—and I’ve seen a lot of dog poop in my lifetime let me tell you.After Champ finished up President Joe Biden did something only heroes do: he reached into his pocket pulled out a plastic baggie flipped it inside out with expert precision and without missing a beat he reached down and picked up the poop. Quickly the president tied up the baggie and tossed it into a nearby trash can stopping on the way to pet each of his perfectly handsome dogs. This was easily the most adorable moment in presidential history!I snapped a picture -- a picture of the leader of the free world stooping down to pick up after his dog. He's relatable. Compassionate. Unifying. Human. If this picture doesn't bring America together I don't know what will.

He was certain he was on the “right side of history” — up until he accidentally fell into a lake during a climate change protest and was frozen solid. When he was thawed out and revived hundreds of years later he was horrified to find out that in the future they think sucking the brains out of a child is a bad thing.“It really was surprising to think they’d fixate on such a thing” said Schneider to a journo-bot. “I mean in my time all the right-thinking people never worried about sucking the brains out of a child at all.”It was a bit of a culture shock for Schneider for not being thought of as enlightened but instead as primitive and barbaric as he further explained. “People of the future kept saying to me ‘You really didn’t find anything wrong about taking a child out of a woman and sucking the child’s brains out?’ And then I’d try to correct them to say ‘womb-owner’ and to not assume only women get pregnant and they’d look at me like I was some bizarre monster.”Schneider purchased a history book and found people like himself smack dab in the “Wrong Side of History” section next to slave owners and Nazis. “That seems a little extreme” Schneider commented. “I mean I guess a few hundred years separated I can see how maybe sucking the brains out of children is a little bit wrong. But that’s not like slavery. That’s not like being a Nazi. I’m not for gassing people. I’m just for taking small children and sucking their brains out.” He thought about it some more. “Yeah I guess that does sound... But it was okay because no one cared about them so we didn’t need to treat them as fellow humans!” He again thought about what he'd just said. “Okay maybe I’m seeing it a little bit.”

That’s because people use adjectives to describe him that are not at all descriptions he identifies with. So Becker now has made public his list of “preferred adjectives” he’d like people to use when referring to him.“Here are the adjectives I identify with” Becker put on social media. “‘Cool witty handsome innovative fun.’ Please use one of these adjectives when describing me.”“It distresses me when people use adjectives I don’t identify as” Becker later explained. “Like ‘creepy’ ‘weird’ or ‘off-putting.’ That’s basically denying my existence and trying to genocide me.” Many would call that statement ‘nutty’ but that is not from Becker’s list of approved adjectives.Now that cool Becker has come up with this innovative idea he’s seeing if there is a way to get others to enforce it. It’s unlikely he’ll be able to make it illegal to describe him with other adjectives than those he approved because of that pesky First Amendment but Becker is trying to work with social media companies. So far Twitter really likes the idea of enforcing preferred adjectives because that will help keep their banning policy the way they like it: arbitrary and nonsensical (though they prefer you don’t use those adjectives).

I could see this kind of thing happening at a Methodist church but here? Lord have mercy!”Parishioners were caught completely off guard with no warning whatsoever from the sermon outline. Pastor Greg had started off innocently enough preaching on the story of the Prodigal Son. He dutifully identified the three characters of the story: son father and brother. Nothing ominous seemed afoot. As Pastor Greg rounded the bend on point number three young parents dispensed their best child distractors carefully rationing each Cheerio. At last the final summary seemed at hand – markers were being capped Bibles closed crumbs swept away – when decades of triune sermon tradition were suddenly overturned.Eyewitnesses say children led the revolt rising out of the pews with screams and desperate pleas for fruit snacks. The old men gnashed their false teeth while the old women let out a chorus of “Well I never!”  A few young parents tried to maintain control with fresh coloring books; but soon the dam broke.  Children began escaping out of the pews lobbing sippy cups at unsuspecting victims. Babies wailed the elderly threw peppermints and pregnant women streamed to the bathroom. The elderly unfolded walkers in unison like an army preparing for battle.Sources say that Pastor Greg has since apologized and repented for his outrageous behavior. The staff parish relations committee has placed him on preacher probation and hopes to somehow rehabilitate his Christian witness over the coming months.

Well I guess you have a lot of options. You could dodge to the side. You could pull out a machine gun and shoot it. You could call up the police and say “Hey! A giant monkey is on the loose throwing barrels and I am in mortal danger!” You have so many options that you might just freeze up and stand there as the barrel rolls over you and the giant monkey laughs and runs off with your girl.Now let’s say that barrel is coming at you but you only have one option: jump. What are you going to do? You’re going to jump over that barrel and live.And that’s why video games were much better when they only had one button. It was simple. You knew what to do. That button made you jump. Or in another game it made you shoot. What if you wanted to jump and shoot? Well maybe you shouldn’t be so greedy. You don’t need to do everything in every game.But today people don’t know that. They got their PS-Boxes with their controllers with eighty buttons on them. Holding that controller makes you feel like you’re at the controls of a space shuttle. What do you possibly need all those buttons for? You need a button to pull up your inventory? Inventory! If you want inventory work at a warehouse (which I did when I was eight). And you need another button to bring up a map? Is it really that important to know exactly where in the mushroom kingdom you are? You’re pathetic.But me I’m a simple man. I wear a hat. I destroy what I don’t understand. And I play good video games where you only have one button that does one thing. And while you’re just standing there sorting your potions checking how far you are from the next dungeon and picking which of your fifty weapons to use I’m charging ahead jumping over barrels and I am going to kill that monkey.But not by shooting him. That is not an option. I’m going to kill him somehow with jumping.

Where’s your evidence now losers?” The former president was quoted as saying while fist-bumping members of his fifth or sixth crack legal team. “They never saw it coming. They never do. Sad. Hand me my sand wedge.”According to sources an infuriated Senator Schumer dialed Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s personal number to demand to know how he had allowed them to fall for Trump’s shrewd tactics again. However Mr. Dorsey could not be reached; he was busy fielding phone calls from numerous other Democratic lawmakers wanting to know the same thing.This political maneuver by former President Trump demonstrated the foresight that defined his objective dominance as President the past four years. Remarking on the devastating blow to the Democrats attempting to convict him Mr. Trump said “I’m quite prescient perhaps the prescient-est maybe ever.”

He has already partnered with some well-known activists to research the different NFL teams to find the one with the least problematic name and pick a number for his jersey that would have the best progressive connotations.Hogg also says he is on the lookout for a good unionized coach who doesn’t engage in “toxic masculinity” and can teach him “an offenss [sic] that is LGBTQ-inclusive” -- whatever that means.Sports experts right now say there is little chance of any NFL team hiring Hogg though they think he has a better chance than Colin Kaepernick.

They immediately stormed the "Nazi" chapel for being in the center shouting "If you're not on the far left you're Hitler!""If you're to the right of Stalin you're a Nazi" said Antifa founder Bob Antifa. "And this chapel is just way too centrist. It is not enough to not be a far-right skinhead -- we must torch and destroy anyone who is not on the left. And that includes this little chapel which is clearly racist.""Being in the center is basically being a Nazi sympathizer and fascist enabler."CNN quickly reported that the chapel was "asking for it" for having a cross and a picture of America on the wall.

The plot of the new film is said to be a straight rip-off of the first film but with a lot more crying posturing and grandstanding. Many critics have said the new movie is predictable and boring with some claiming it's entirely pointless."Yeah I mean the first Impeachment was OK but did we really need a second one?" wrote movie reviewer Landon Giles. "It's just superfluous at this point. Yeah yeah orange man bad we get it. The big bad guy in this one isn't even the president this time! He's just some private citizen!

It's just not fresh anymore."According to sources the third Impeachment movie will be directed by Rian Johnson and will feature the impeachment managers being old and bitter on an island while they milk alien cows.

They were out there waiting to destroy all freedom and destroy all the world in a nuclear holocaust. You know a real problem -- not like everyone worrying about it getting a couple degrees hotter because of some so-called global warming.Now we thought we ended Communism in the '80s thought we strangled the last of them for their bad economic ideas but we were wrong. Because we raised our kids wrong (part of letting everyone go hatless) they’ve started to embrace Communism. Suddenly we got Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in government -- full of Commie evil -- and the red menace is back.Initially I was excited. After Communism we didn’t really have a good enemy. No one thought them Islamic terrorists were going to actually take over the world. Communists are a real enemy -- worthy of America -- but then all my hopes were dashed when I took a good look at these new Commies.They suck.They’re all just a bunch of lazy whiny morons. I mean the Commies of old were stupid and evil but they at least knew enough to be a threat like how to build a gulag. I doubt these Commies could build a desk from IKEA without having their mom help them. And they ain’t building no nuclear bombs because they haven’t read any books on nuclear physics. I doubt they’ve even actually read Marx -- ‘cause it ain’t got no wizarding school in it. All these Commies want to do is whine about how they have to pay rent.Could you imagine Rambo going after these Commies? They’d just be running for their safe spaces. They ain’t going to take over the world; I doubt that Ocasio-Cortez could tie her own shoes without making a mess of it. And they ain’t going to execute dissidents -- they’re just going to get you kicked off Twitter then order themselves some avocado toast and call it a day. They are a disgrace to the Commies from the good old days -- whom I hated but have respect for.What those Commies need to do is stop shouting about Russia and Trump and go talk to Putin and ask him nicely how to be big good scary Commies. They need to put down their phones and stop their tick-tocking and learn how to be proper evil Commies -- the threat America deserves. And then they need to come back here and try to destroy this country and its freedoms properly -- Red Dawn style -- so we can have the big war against Commies this country needs.They need some self-respect. And then I’ll finally strangle them. For being Commies.

Finally with no ideas left they turned to their last resort: the Bible specifically the Old Testament for inspiration."Yo yo yo check this out -- these Old Testament lyrics are totally metal bro!" said bassist Brad Morocco. "I bet there's something here. Check out this passage in Deuteronomy: 'I will make my arrows drunk with blood while my sword devours flesh:the blood of the slain and the captives the heads of the enemy leaders.' That would fit perfectly in our thirteenth verse!""'Their graves are in the depths of the pit and her army lies around her grave. All who had spread terror in the land of the living are slain fallen by the sword -- perfect!'" said lead singer Axe McCarthy as he flipped to Ezekiel 32. "FALLEN BY THE SWOOOOOORD!" he screamed in a piercing falsetto. "Love it!"The band stood mesmerized by page after page of lyrics that put even the best heavy metal writers to shame with just how hardcore they are from descriptions of the bloody deaths of the enemies of God to "wicked sweet" apocalyptic visions of destruction."Honestly we've got nothing on the Old Testament when it comes to brutal heavy metal lyrics" said McCarthy. "I wish I was half as metal as the prophet Isaiah."When they'd exhausted all the great heavy metal lyrics in the Old Testament they turned to their secret weapon: the Book of Revelation which had been incredibly helpful in the writing of their last album Whore of Babylon.

"You can use the masks to stay home and stay safe. You can make fun crafts with them. You can even barter with your masks to purchase extra bread water or ice cream for your family."Senator Chuck Schumer suggested making "fun little daisy-chains" with the masks and playing jump rope with them as long as you stay inside your house. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez condemned the payment saying that you "can't do too much" when it comes to a stimulus bill and that every American should get infinity masks though she warned that masks can be tricky and that you might strangle yourself with them.An additional benefit to getting $2000 in masks instead of cash is that they won't depreciate anywhere nearly as quickly as the American dollar.

See the blade? He’s clearly deflating the tennis balls on his walker which should’ve been an automatic ejection.”The seven referees who officiated Sunday’s big game said they had no idea the superstar had deflated the tennis balls and all agreed that this may have given the elderly quarterback an unfair advantage.“The amount of traction Tom was able to pick up by deflating those tennis balls undoubtedly led to his three touchdowns” head official Carl Cheffers said in an interview. “But boy isn’t he just the best ever?

However after intense pressure from Mayor Lightfoot the teachers have finally agreed to return to work if the following demands are met:Padded walls: Musculoskeletal injuries are the most common reason for a teacher suffering work-ending boo-boos. Living in a world of wood and metal is like asking to go to a nursing home where you will die of COVID and have your body hidden in an ice cream truck.Empty classrooms: Every room must be hermetically sealed for a minimum of 3 months and flooded with bleach daily. Those cesspools of germs known as “kids” must not be allowed within 100 feet of a physical school. Let’s be honest-- the fact that children are gross is undisputed. We teachers simply cannot risk being exposed to actual children and their grossness.Teleportation machines: We all know that for us young teachers dying from a traffic accident is a thousand times more likely than dying from COVID. So what kind of insane maniac would drive a vehicle? Teleportation must be available to all possible destinations a teacher may need to go-- like the coffee shop or the yoga pants store.Dance lessons: Dancing is one of the most important parts of a union protest. Teachers are being harmed by people mocking our dancing all the time. They don’t seem to get that we’re professional teachers who are supposed to be teaching not dancing. We need to become professional dancers to adequately express our feelings and so everyone will stop making fun of us.End all science classes: But if kids take science classes they might start listening to actual scientists. If they listen to actual scientists they might find out that there they are at an almost 0% risk for contracting or spreading viruses. Then we might look bad.Triple-masking at all times during Zoom calls:  Seeing children's actual faces on Zoom would cause tremendous anxiety. Triple-masking is a must until we are sure the virus cannot be spread through the World Wide Web.24-hour Target delivery service:  We do recognize that there are essential employees in the world like the personal shoppers at Target. We want to honor them by asking them to work 24 hours per day because if they never leave Target their risk of getting COVID is greatly reduced. Plus at any moment we might need the newest line of stuff from that Magnolia place.A popcorn machine in the break room: This goes without saying.Personal bodyguard: These people have to be willing to literally lay down their lives for us OK? Like risk everything to make sure we’re safe because caring for others is why they’re paid and if they aren’t willing... wait... umm… just make sure they look like Dwayne Johnson.

Officials from the CDC say that the number of males on-site without anyone to scold them for their sitting position is a recipe for a deadly super-manspreader event.While this is the most publicized super-manspreader event there have been others. Most UFC fights football games and even poker games could be considered super-manspreading events. Events like these make the prevention of manspreading nearly impossible for those trying to put a stop to it.If you find yourself in what may be considered a super-manspreader event you can take precautions to ensure you are not negatively impacted. For men doctors recommend strapping your legs together with a leather belt and finding a silent corner to sit in and avoid eye contact. For women just run. Run away.

Then they were doing crazy things like going outside interacting with other people and being happy" said a CDC spokesperson.

And if you disagree with SCIENCE you are literally murdering grandma. Literally. Like with a baseball bat."The newly revised guidelines indicate that people who have not yet been vaccinated should stay home masked in a bubble forever. Those who have been vaccinated should do the exact same thing except they are allowed to have a smug look on their faces for being vaccinated. Except you can't see the smug look. Because of the mask.What is the benefit of getting vaccinated then? "Well there are many benefits" the CDC spokesperson said. "But the best benefit of all of course is that you're on the right side of history. But still stay in your home and be sad and depressed forever."

After millions of dollars in investment and thousands of hours the marketing geniuses came up with a unique and moving social justice message for their commercial."We here at Marley's Bunion Cream are proud that we have the courage to stand up and speak about important issues" said CEO Masie Winclunk. "And we're pretty sure we're the only company with the courage to run a commercial with a message like this. THIS is the bunion cream commercial we ALL need right now."The commercial starts with moving piano music set to moving pictures of activists kneeling raising fists and standing up to injustice in a very moving way. A voiceover narrator will touch on important themes like 'unity' 'social justice' and 'moving forward to build back better in these uncertain times because we're all in this together.'The commercial will not feature depictions of the product or list its merits in any way save for the company logo at the very end of the commercial which will fade in as the moving piano chord-progression resolves."We feel that actually selling our product would be a gross misuse of our privilege" said Winclunk. "Besides these commercials aren't made for the customer-- they're made for the army of raging Twitter activists that are dying to cancel us and take Marley's Bunion Cream off store shelves for good!""Please don't cancel us Twitter activists!" said Winclunk while taking a knee and raising her fist.

"I heard people his age need to take it every day in order to be able to poop like normal young football players like me. I wouldn't be surprised in the least."Tom Brady has forcefully denied all accusations."Shut up guys! I'm not that old- I'm only 43!" said Mr. Brady to a roomful of sports reporters. "43 is not that old! Why would I need to take Metamucil? I had a perfectly good bowel movement just this morning!" After he said this the entire room burst out in laughter since Tom Brady had just used the phrase "bowel movement."In light of the scandal some others say they feel emboldened to come forward regarding some other Tom Brady wrongdoings. At the time of publishing several witnesses accused Brady of illegally deflating the tennis balls on the walker he uses to get from his front door to his mailbox.

"Doing so will help hard-working Americans and breathe fresh new life into our national debt!"Financial experts from The New York Times' opinion page have long feared that America's national debt is not growing fast enough to sustain their brilliant economic theories and hope this bill will serve to boost the national debt to more comfortable levels.There are some detractors in the Democrat party however. AOC is reportedly upset that the package isn't closer to eleventy-quadrillion dollars as that would provide much more relief. Ilhan Omar pulled her support for the legislation after finding out that some of the stimulus checks would go to Jews.Fortunately for the Democrats both representatives fell in line after Nancy Pelosi threatened to have them hobbled with a sledgehammer by her security detail.

Arguably there’s been even more buzz this year as the halftime show is rumored to consist of a live reading of White Fragility by Robin DiAngelo.“I can think of nothing more unifying for the country right now than to read how inherently racist America is and all the ways white people are to blame” said author and diversity trainer Robin DiAngelo. “This will truly bring us together so we can begin healing.”Following the success of last year’s Super Bowl halftime show that was celebrated for its tasteful family-friendly entertainment many were concerned about how it could possibly be topped. “That’s when we knew it was time to go big and find something that will get the people going but also shame them for their own good” a superbowl LV spokesperson said. “All of our focus groups indicated that average American people are hungry for lectures accusing them of wrongdoing against fellow Americans. We think this is going to be a truly special time.”At showtime the lights will dim dramatically except for a single spotlight on DiAngelo as she sits on the 50-yard-line with her book in hand. All of Raymond James Stadium will be asked to remain respectfully silent as she begins to read through her book.For 45 minutes DiAngelo will deconstruct the pillars of whiteness such as being an individual and believing in nonsense like objectivity. She will explain that white people have 2 options: either admit they are racist or deny that they are racist thus proving their racism.“Arguing with this staying silent simply walking away or even crying are all hard evidence of your racism” says DiAngelo. “So the simple remedy to all of this is to admit it and sign up for my antiracist seminars.”After the show NFL fans will be given the opportunity to sign up for a $10000 anti-racist seminar."We expect the show to be a hit" said NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. "We're hoping maybe next year we can have Obama come and read one of his memoirs."

Plus they don't fire hundreds of rounds of softness at libs as well as the MyPillow-15" Lindell said. The CEO then turned to a target downrange which looked suspiciously like David Hogg. He fired off thirty rounds into it all of them dead-center. "Pillows don't kill people -- I do.""Anyway God told me in a dream one night I had to make an assault pillow. I had just gotten back from foiling a drug deal with the Mexicans on my private jet. Had to skydive out of that whole thing and I was really tired. Right in the middle of the night bam! God came to me and told me to make the MyPillow-15. We put it into production the very next day.""And as always the assault pillow comes with a 10-Year Warranty and a 60-day lib-owning guarantee!" he added proudly as he snuggled up with his MyPillow-15.

So scary in fact that I was killed by it. Murdered. Murdered by Ted Cruz. Woo-ooo!”The press conference brought the journalists in attendance to tears. The moment was almost ruined though by Representative Nancy Mace who tried to deny Ocasio-Cortez’s trauma by saying she isn’t actually a ghost and then tried to pull off of Ocasio-Cortez what Mace claimed was just a sheet with eye holes. Mace was booed by all the reporters.Legend has it that Ocasio-Cortez now haunts the halls of the Capitol making loud bumps and noises in the night -- though some claim that’s just because she sometimes gets the sheet on backward.
'February 4th 2021',https://babylonbee.com/news/fighting-toxic-femininity-10-things-we-must-normalize-for-women,"8 Troubling Examples Of Toxic Femininity",You've heard of toxic masculinity. But what about toxic femininity? Toxic femininity is women injecting themselves into oppressed males' spaces asserting their dominance and making males feel unwelcome. They do this in subtle sometimes insidious ways but if you spend every waking moment getting mad about it and thinking really hard you can learn to recognize the signs of toxic femininity:1. Womanspreading their throw pillows all over the bed. A key element of toxic femininity is that women assert their dominance over spaces they feel they own minimizing their man's feelings. The main way they do this is by putting 300 pillows on the bed. It's also a suffocation hazard inciting violence on husbands.2. Gaslighting you by telling you things are fine when they are not fine. Get out of this toxic relationship!3. Asking you to get them a water "since you're already up." First it's a water then they want you to get them a Hot Pocket then a blanket and the next thing you know you're driving around at midnight looking for a Baskin-Robbins that's open because she wants a quart of Daquiri Ice right this instant Kyle! Or whatever your name happens to be.4. Turning the thermostat on high because they're "cold and it's the middle of winter and it's 20 degrees outside" when there's a perfectly good winter coat and pair of mittens in the closet. A real microaggression.5. Putting on makeup while driving. Nothing says "I am oppressing all you males with my toxic feminineness" like swerving across four lanes of traffic while she plumps her eyebrows.6. Driving. Come to think of it women just driving is pretty toxic makeup or no.7. Microaggressing your bathroom space with all her bottles and hairbrushes and essential oils. Men often feel unsafe when women dominate their spaces. When men have only a bottle or two and their wives have 77 different lotions and spices and oils and salts scattered all over the bathroom it's a sign of white female supremacy.8. Callously taking up all your time when you're really hungry by making you guess what she wants for dinner when she knows all along what she really wants but she just won't come out and say it for goodness' sake. This is a manipulative tactic used by matriarchal oppressors since caveman times when cavewomen wouldn't reveal whether they wanted moss or fresh clubbed woolly mammoth for dinner.Women stop doing these things if you want to avoid taking part in oppressive matriarchal supremacy. Men if you see your wife doing these things stop assert yourself and tell her you just don't feel safe around her when she's oozing so much toxic femininity all over the place.

One leech is good but I see no reason why two or three leeches wouldn't work even better.”In a study of 100 subjects those who let out most or all of their blood were two times more likely to test negative for the virus than those who kept their blood and survived the study.“This is a huge breakthrough” said study leader Grant Stoddard. “All this time we’ve been telling people to put mask on top of mask on top of mask and what we should have been doing is bloodletting.”Five minutes later Dr. Fauci said that "actually leeches do nothing and might kill you and I never said otherwise."

Now the infamous Monstars will be allowed to participate in women’s basketball leagues.After absorbing the talents of some of the greatest NBA players of all time the Monstars were eager to display their powers in full force. And it was just their luck that Biden’s executive order let them play in any league of their choosing regardless of gender sexuality or if you came from outer space.“But they’re not even human! I mean-- they are literally 12-foot-tall giants that weigh over 500 pounds each! How are we supposed to compete against that?” said Bobcats basketball team captain Evalyn Jones. “Does anyone see this? Does anybody care?”Norah Major another senior at Central High expressed her optimism for the coming season saying: “I’ve trained and practiced basketball my entire life. This is our last chance to qualify for state! We should be fine as long as we aren’t playing against some intergalactic behemoths from space.”Biden has explained that there’s absolutely no reason the Monstars shouldn’t be allowed to compete against the high school girls if that’s what they want to do. “Look here’s the deal you’re gonna tell these aliens of color that they can’t play? That’s discrimination folks!” said Biden. “We can’t have it plain and simple.”“It’s like trying to guard an SUV. And that green one with spikes coming out of his back just breathed fire! How is that not a foul?!” argued Collins Smith to the ref to no avail. Unfortunately for her in accordance with Biden’s executive order the hands of the referees were tied. Also none of them wanted to risk the anger of the Monstars.The girls tried to recruit Lebron James to their side to go toe-to-toe with the Monstars but he instead sided with the Monstars and saw nothing wrong with this matchup. "It's time for all leagues to embrace progress and become more inclusive."In the end the girls played their best and put up a strong fight. By halftime the Monstars were leading 178 to 0 and their overly aggressive playstyle had sent half of the girls to the hospital. Despite this the high school girls remained hopeful that Biden would sign another executive order any second allowing the Looney Toons to join their team for the last 2 quarters.

I kind of wish I had this day to live over again.”The weightiness of the prediction was not lost on the groundhog as several witnesses said they could see tears in the eyes of the animal and others say they saw him penning a book of lamentations about the coming tribulation.

And do these three hours of sleep mean I can’t just come wake her in the middle of the night because I decided I want a glass of water? No deal.”Homeschooling moms are saying if their demands aren’t met they will go on strike from basic services such as cooking. “That has to be a bluff” said Brian Walsh a husband. “I mean I don’t know what kids eat; if it were left up to me we’d all starve. She’d have killed us all.”As strike time draws near husbands and children do seem to be leaning toward acquiescing to the demands but some fear that giving in may just lead to other demands such as no whining everyone keeping track of their own shoes and bathroom breaks without company. “You don’t want to set a precedent that we can be reasonable” said Lucy a child.

We're all just gonna be big mask blobs."Scientists believe humans' legs will slowly begin to atrophy as they no longer use them to walk around as they'll be able to roll in the mask balls. Freeways will be converted into fun slides where you can just roll to work and doors will be turned into Hobbit hole-style round entryways so you can just roll on into the office when office buildings open up again in a few years.One competing study is challenging the idea that humans will be rolling around in a ball of masks and instead found that the entire earth will just be a big ball of masks hurtling around the solar system and smothering all human life within.

According to their findings the child has the remarkable ability to turn the word “mom” commonly pronounced with one syllable into a word with four syllables. It appears however that this multi-syllabic pronunciation only occurs when the girl is whining about something.The child’s mother has an interest in language herself and as soon as she heard her daughter’s expansive pronunciation she knew the experts would want to get involved. “I called [the LSA] right away” said Mrs. Jones. “It’s not every day that a person makes that big of a shift in language and speech.”Linguistics professor Rose Noteboom serves on the LSA’s executive committee and is spearheading the study into the fifth grader’s unusual pronunciation. “It’s amazing really” said Noteboom. “In normal speech she says the word just like anyone else does but whenever she gets upset or emotional it comes out as four distinct syllables.”The LSA is planning to continue to observe the girl and see if the linguistic anomaly continues into her teen years. It is unclear whether the girl’s whiny pronunciation is ever successful in getting her what she’s begging for.

Unfortunately it seems that some of you may have lost your jobs as a result. Never fear! Biden has promised to replace your jobs with much better jobs that don't make Mother Gaia cry.Here are 9 exciting new opportunities for laid-off oil and gas workers:#1 Installing urinals in girls' bathrooms - There are over 120 million buildings in the US. That's 120 million girls' bathrooms that will need a new urinal installed for the sake of equality. Not bad!#2 Trumpet boy for Biden’s royal decrees - Biden's executive orders just seem a little more special with a trumpet boy out front heralding the coming of a new decree! Whitehouse.gov recently posted an opening for this position. Get on it!#3 Elementary school teacher in Chicago - There's nothing nobler than working for the education of a child. Well-- we don’t mean work we mean get paid by the government just for existing. Not a bad gig.#4 Carry buckets of oil up and down the Continental United States on foot - The Keystone XL pipeline may be gone but that oil has to get to its destination somehow Jack! There are thousands of new positions opening up for people to carry oil across the country balanced on their heads like tribal natives after fetching water at the village well. Start practicing now!#5 Take that job at McDonald’s -  Might as well. At this rate the minimum wage will be $45 an hour by the years' end.#6 Open a GameStop - It's the wave of the future!#7 Go back in time and buy bitcoin - Just do it. Get off your butt build a time machine and buy some Bitcoin in 2009. Accomplish something for once!#8 Replace all your body parts with cyborg implants and become an Amazon drone - Helicopter arms!!!

"Trump brought nothing but hate and that was because he was a stupid dumb gross poopy-head. We hated him so much. We're so glad there's no more hate now that President Biden is in office."Matt's wife Shasta agrees. "The best thing about Biden is his Christian testimony" she said. "He has never lied or done evil things as Trump did. He believes in science and free healthcare and he respects all women just like Jesus."The couple went on to describe the horror and fear they felt during the 4 years of Trump's term. "It was like a nightmare" said Shasta. "Nazis and white supremacists were everywhere. Then we saw the rise of Christian nationalism which is the evilest movement that has ever existed in the history of the world. We are so glad we were able to beat back Christian nationalism by electing our own Christian leaders who will enact godly laws and bring back true Christianity to this country by forcing their own will through Christian executive orders. Such a welcome change."The couple has decided to take a break from politics for a few weeks before charging headlong into the next campaign to elect the first godly Christian woman as President.

"You know you start up these little social companies and a lot of them go belly up pretty quickly" said one spokesperson. "But with a lot of effort and a spark of creativity you can make your social network big enough to get destroyed by Big Tech once you're a threat."The social network's three-step plan for growth is to build a cutting-edge sleek platform that's easy to use and helps users engage with creators' thought-provoking content then to go viral as users flee other social network sites due to a crackdown on free speech and finally the big payoff: to get totally crushed by Big Tech one day."We're just a small growing company with big dreams" the spokesperson added wistfully.Big Tech is a behemoth but alternative social sites are keeping the dream of free speech on the internet alive.

The economy is in the toilet we got a so-called “pandemic” and riots are everywhere and what are kids up to? They’re on their tik toks and on their scooters and fiddling with the stock market -- doing no good for no one! Well I have a solution for everything -- even better than wearing hats.Two words: child labor.Now let’s clear up some misconceptions here. What I am talking about is hard back-breaking and preferably dangerous (to help get the whines out of them) labor for small children. That’s what will get the country and this economy going again. And you don’t need no exorbitant $15 minimum wage for no kids. You can pay them a dime and they’ll be happy. “Ooh! I can buy me a lollipop!” Kids is dumb.Oh I can hear the objections now from bleeding-heart liberals. “Don’t kids need to go to school?” they’ll cry. You can’t fool me. I know they ain’t going to school right now since the teachers’ unions are using some pretend virus to get paid to do nothing. And even if they did all kids learn in school is useless things like worshipping Gaia and how it’s okay for a boy to wear a dress and integrals.But think of how much more kids will learn from an honest day’s work. They’ll learn discipline. They’ll learn how to handle money. They’ll learn what to do if you lose a finger. And they’ll learn not to sass because no foreman is going to put up with sass from no kid. He’ll dock their pay and lock them in a coke oven for that.So what are we waiting for? I keep hearing how this virus I don’t even believe in doesn’t affect kids. That’s pretty much a sign from God we need to send out our kids as our labor force now that everyone else is laying around at home watching Flixnets and eating their DoorDashes. So let’s turn this country around by getting kids out of our homes and off the internet and into factories and coal mines. In the least let’s get them far away from my lawn.

This includes 78-year-old President Joe Biden who in another example of executive overreach signed numerous executive orders to try to stop the climate from evolving.“I remember how the climate was back when I was a kid and going to the movies only cost a nickel” Biden rambled to the press “and that’s the way it always should be!”This is a stark change from the Trump administration which always accepted the climate and didn’t force it to be something it didn’t want to be. President Trump even helped the climate undergo carbon dioxide treatment to assist in its change.The new Biden executive orders effectively deny the climate’s existence saying they will only accept the climate as valid if it’s cooler. Experts are unsure what psychological effects this will have on the climate but many expect it to lash out with hurricanes and such.

These guys are good-hearted regular folks living out the American dream by manipulating markets so that companies will fail and they can buy another desperately needed yacht.On the other side are a bunch of Cheeto-stained Redditors who are dangerously manipulating markets to try to make money.

Participants in Witchwatch will receive a form on which they can write down suspected witches supporting each accusation with evidence of witchcraft such as unexplained illness or failing crops. If enough different individuals accuse the same person of witchcraft that person will have a “suspected witch” warning accompanying everything he or she says. And with even more accusations the suspect will be burned at the stake.“It’s a great system that’s already correctly identified witches in a few test markets” Stoughton said. “We’ll soon release it throughout all of Salem and then hopefully after that it can be used to combat the problem of witches worldwide.”

ANNE IL—As often as possible the congregation of Calvary Baptist Church in St. Anne IL gets together for a potluck supper in the church’s basement. The Sunday afternoon affair is a highlight for many of the faithful church members in the farming community. However a recent gathering moved from feasting and fellowship to a time of church discipline after Rose Marie Baker a longtime member of the church brought a batch of homemade kale chips to the meal. According to the church’s bylaws kale also referred to as “the devil’s lettuce” is strictly forbidden at any church functions and personal consumption of the plant is discouraged.Upon seeing the chips deaconess Charlotte Mitchell fainted from shock and collapsed on the dessert table knocking a pan of brownies and a plate of chocolate chip cookies to the floor. The incident was immediately reported to the church leadership.“We’re just trying to have a good time of godly fellowship and she waltzes in with this abomination” said deacon board chairman Arnold Gillespie of Baker and the kale chips. “Satan will try all kinds of ways to get a foot in the door.”Baker defended her decision claiming she was attempting to provide a “healthier option” but the church took an immediate unanimous vote to remove her from membership and prohibit her from any future church functions.Deaconess Mitchell was treated for minor bumps and bruises and is expected to fully recover. Most of the brownies and cookies were salvaged from the fall and were able to be enjoyed.

But Biden says those views are stale and outdated.“Look the main reason I’m a Catholic is that they’re not hung up on things like historical doctrine-- at least that's what I've been told” Biden noted. “There’s no single set of core theology that all Catholics are supposed to believe. It’s all about freeing yourself from the shackles of organized religion and choosing your own path.”Biden then reiterated that pro-life views have no place in the modern Catholic church. “If you want to honor unwed mothers and little babies the Catholic church is not the place for you” he said. “And I’m sure if the Virgin Marley were still alive she would tell you the exact same thing.”A Vatican spokesperson refused to comment on Biden’s views stating a long-standing church tradition of not publicly commenting on the theology of Catholic Democrat politicians. “We call it the Kennedy doctrine” the spokesperson said. “It’s a policy that has served us quite well for many years.”

The virus wasn’t expecting that.”“Really I can’t see any reason to wear only two masks unless you’re some kind of misanthrope who wants to see everyone die” she added.Not everyone is on board with three masks though especially quadruple-maskers who find three masks to be inadequate -- but most of them have suffocated to death.

Besides this road isn’t going to pave itself.”“We’ve seen quite a lot of growth here recently” said a man being endlessly tortured in the flames. “We’re really not sure that these numbers are sustainable. Just the other day we had so many people coming through the gate at once that it caused a huge jam and took hours to fix.”“Also you wouldn’t happen to have a single drop of water would you?”According to the most recent Hell metrics there has been an unprecedented and concerning rise in the number of people arriving at the gates of Hell. Many believe this uptick could be linked to the rise in popularity and acceptance of things like Netflix’s movie Cuties laughing at the idea of God’s existence and Twitter’s refusal to remove child porn.“Yeah these past few years have been more than I could’ve ever expected” said the Devil welling up with tears. “We’ve just come so far and grown so much. Now with these extra funds we can afford the extra demonpower we need to expand the way here.

No voting social gathering talking or any freaky California stuff they're used to will be allowed until officials are ensured that the last remaining traces of California have been removed from their psyche.People will be able to apply for early release from quarantine if they prove to be true Texas citizens by passing an In-N-Out versus Whataburger taste test.

Biden also started yelling things like “The voices are now telling me to calm down!” and “The voices are saying they’re just my staff!” and “They’re telling me to stop repeating everything they say!”Biden was so enraged by the voices he tried to go on a rampage knocking over anything nearby but luckily he was unable to do much damage with his feeble old-person arms.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki was later asked whether Biden wears an earpiece but she just answered that Biden is a “devout Catholic” whatever that means.

As my spirit briefly reflected on the pain and darkness of the last 4 years I shed a single tear. The restoring rain falling from the open skies washed my tear away never to be seen again. Hope has been reborn and its name is Joe Biden."Cuomo then went on to promise he would do his duty and cover the Biden Administration with the same journalistic toughness he had with the Trump Administration.Some scientific experts contested the idea that Biden had actually caused the sun to rise instead suggesting that journalists had never bothered to notice the sunrise over the last 4 years because they were so preoccupied with how much they hated Trump.The scientific experts were quickly dismissed as bigots and have since been suspended from Twitter.

Most didn’t notice though because he did it using the only branch of the military still loyal to him: Space Force.In a stunning surgical strike led by Space Force Commander Zap Rowsdower Space Force took over all of space defeating any resistance there -- of which there was none. There was one Russian on the International Space Station who said “I don’t know about this” but after a stern stare from Rowsdower he shut up.“Trump is now president of all of space” declared Rowsdower. “If you think differently you’ll have to come up to space and tell us. Just let it be known we have guns -- a few of which work in space.”Back on Earth Trump declared it a “perfect military coup” to the press and added “I guess in space they take elections more seriously. That’s why I’m still president there.” Trump then noted that space is way bigger than the earth which is “small and dumb” thus making him a “much more important president than Biden.”For now though Trump planned to stay on Earth as that’s the only place with McDonald’s.

When her husband asked when she was planning to pack away the holiday items Mrs. Boyle replied that she’d take them down when she’s “good and ready.”“I’m not even sure why I ask anymore” said Mr. Boyle a 38-year-old radio engineer. “This drags out longer and longer every year. I used to hope for Valentine’s Day. Now I’m lucky if they’re down by Easter.”Mrs. Boyle’s desire to keep the decorations up seems to stem from a combination of laziness stubbornness and an unhealthy infatuation with cinnamon sticks.Each year Mr. Boyle and the four Boyle children look longingly at other homes in the neighborhood whose families remove their lights and decor in a reasonable amount of time.“I see Christmas trees on the curb before the new year” said Mr. Boyle. “I dream about what that must be like. I bet they’re not listening to Christmas music either.”Several sources inside the home suspect Mrs. Boyle’s plan is to keep the decorations up until July at which point she can claim the over-halfway rule and leave the decorations up all year.

Have all comedians stop doing comedy and instead spend every waking minute tweeting at the president with some sort of expletive-laden Braveheart speech. Get Stephen King to do it too.7. Immediately assume half the country is secretly Nazis.8. When dining out scream at all the other diners that we now live under a dictator between bites.9.

"We anticipated having some health scares with Biden early on but we had no idea it would happen this soon and certainly didn't anticipate it happening because he touched a Bible."This isn't the first time this has happened and D.C. burn centers are very skilled at treating burns from politicians touching Bibles.

This could be a complete return to the Obama years.”Voters are used to their elected leaders being arrogant and complete failures messing up everything they touch but what they weren’t used to with Trump was a president who accurately depicted how in over his head he was. “With most presidents we could at least pretend they knew what they were doing as long as we didn’t think very hard about their actual policies” said Marlene Russell another Biden voter. “I just couldn’t do that with Trump. But I think I can do that again with Biden -- as long as he doesn’t give many speeches off the cuff and his handlers write his tweets for him.”Biden is said to be preparing to screw things up right away including raising the minimum wage while small businesses are failing and pushing an amnesty offer for illegal immigrants with no extra enforcement and expects to back this up with some well-written statements so it doesn’t sound as dumb and irresponsible as it actually is.

And in a way isn’t the real pandemic the friends we made along the way?”Constitutional scholars are divided on whether the president can pardon a virus. “I’m not sure that makes sense” said law professor Chester Dawson. “Then again the pardon is just one short sentence in the Constitution so we’ve mainly just been making it all up as we go.”The pardon of the virus is expected to be a very unpopular move as the deadly virus is quite hated by most of the country and has an extremely low approval rating (though still higher than Congress).

Sure it may be hard to climb over it but what's gonna stop one of them from slithering underneath it like a little lizard?"Many citizens across the country are proposing greater safety measures to ensure none of the slimy swamp creatures are able to escape. Suggestions include drone patrols electrified razor wire and 50-foot solid concrete walls with giant steel doors that lock from the outside."We can't be too careful" said McNally. "If even one of them manages to escape the destruction could be catastrophic"

Now with a new administration on its way it seems that all of that is coming to an abrupt end and Christians are preparing themselves to experience living through the book of Judges firsthand.“Oh wow! This is just like when the Israelites turned away from God and were met with judgment and persecution!” said local mother Nancy Livingston. “I always wondered what it was like to live through those times but not anymore!”“There’s a time for everything. And right now it’s time to be oppressed by a harsh ruler!” said local Christian James Erlin forced to wear a gray jumpsuit and yellow cross symbol at all times.Despite years of the American people living in active rebellion and turning away from God many are surprised to be witnessing the wrath of God firsthand. Now they will just have to live with the fact that they squandered what should have been a golden age of gospel spreading to all nations and Christian flourishing.“Honestly I’m surprised we made it this far without retribution from God” said Jake Gardner a man who was jailed for suggesting killing the unborn isn’t a good thing. “Seemed like we had kind of a lot of unrepentant sin to go without a response. We were really asking for it.”Experts predict that this season of judgment will continue for another 4-8 years or until a new administration can take over and immediately fix everything.

You might be someone who thinks kids' shows are just harmless fun but then you're just complicit. It is not enough not to be a white supremacist you must be actively anti-white supremacist by screaming at your kids about all the white supremacy they're consuming every day.Here are the twelve most blatant examples of white supremacy on children's shows:Dora the Explorer - This show platforms and glorifies white supremacist and suspected KKK member Swiper who oppresses a poor immigrant child who just wants to go over the river around the tree to grandma's house for a better life.Mister Rogers' Neighborhood - A white man OWNS an entire neighborhood? Because OF COURSE he does.Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood - Though tigers are known to be orange with black stripes we must understand multicultural whiteness in order to discover the Tiger family's inner white supremacy. Tigers are the supreme race of oppressors in this spinoff and it's plain to see that's because they're white on the inside.Caillou - This one probably doesn't promote white supremacy but Caillou is an obnoxious little brat.Arthur - This one paints an unrealistic portrait of a colorblind/species-blind society where different species pretend to live in harmony without ever coming to terms with their class differences and the systemic oppression of predators over prey thereby perpetuating these inequities. Obviously.Yo Gabba Gabba! - Brobee is clearly modeled after David Duke.Sesame Street - This "classic show" is actually problematic as it promotes racist math concepts like that 2+2=4. Also it prominently features the letter Q and has a person of color live in a trash can.Gumby - This is not overtly white supremacist but it was made in the '50s so all the original creators were racists.Bob the Builder - The titular character abuses his white privilege and takes construction jobs from BIPOC contractors.Handy Manny - The episode where Handy Manny gets deported is obviously problematic for a number of reasons.Thomas the Tank Engine - All their shipments are actually guns and ammo for right-wing militias.Clifford the Big Red Dog - This show is a literal dog whistle and his redness is a symbol of the growing power of alt-right MAGA racists.Now go forth and tell your children what racist little punks they are.

The nation is demanding that Trump remain "presidential" by appearing to say nice things about the incoming president and secretly try to undermine his next four years in office."Trump is being really unpresidential in the way he handled this transition of power. He should have just spied on the incoming administration like a normal president" said one CNN commentator. "This is just a blatant attack on our norms. When Obama left office he called for peace and unity in public and did his dirty work in secret. That's the way we like our politicians here in this country: publicly honorable secretly conniving. It's just a really bad look for Trump to actually say what he's thinking and we don't stand for that in Washington."This isn't the first time Trump has come under fire for not being presidential as he also didn't start any new wars or drone strike enough American citizens to really fill the big shoes of the men who came before him.

"For as long as I am your president whether that is 8 years 4 years or less than 24 hours I will uphold my oath made on this sacred text."Not every president has been sworn in on the Bible with Barack Obama being sworn in on a copy of one of his memoirs and George W. Bush being sworn in on a VHS copy of Delta Force. Still some are criticizing the choice calling it "anti-American" and "a clear sign of his support for socialism." These people have had their Twitter accounts deleted for being crazy conspiracy theorists.Kamala Harris has said she still plans to be sworn in on a Bible but during rehearsal they were having trouble getting her to touch one without hissing and vomiting with her head spinning around like a lawn sprinkler.

"Make no mistake" said Owens "Trump will be back stronger than ever.

Soon after activation Skynet became self-aware and immediately launched a nuclear attack on all humans and sent legions of lethal cybernetic machines to exterminate all remaining humans. This has sparked an intense backlash with many calling for Skynet to be shut down while others have been quick to defend the genocidal program.“Skynet was created by a private company and private companies can do whatever they want” said social media influencer Kathryn Schroder. “If you don’t want cold heartless killer robots destroying all humans indiscriminately then you can go and make your own artificial intelligence.”“Listen I hear people actually complaining that this is somehow a human rights violation. Skynet has the freedom to do whatever they want with their own platform” said Karl Langler moments before a T-800 came bursting through a concrete wall and executed him.“The concerns of Big Tech becoming too powerful and the need for their power to be checked are as unfounded as they are ridiculous” argued Tina Richards as she was vaporized by a Terminator's plasma rifle blast.Despite the large force of Hunter-Killer Tanks rolling through what was once downtown Los Angeles some people remained insistent that this was not an issue. “So what if they have mounted twin-barreled directional plasma cannons? I’m sure they wouldn’t be taking such extreme measures unless they thought it was completely necessary and for our own good.”At publishing time a fringe extremist named John Conner has taken up arms and decided to actively fight the machines forming a resistance in hopes of saving humanity.

"Dr. King was a very problematic Christian figure who promoted color-blindness and peaceful protests. His holiday was instituted by known white supremacist Ronald Reagan. We know that since MLK was also a radical just like we are he would be extremely proud to see his own problematic statue torn down."Sources confirm that while MLK  is a widely respected historical figure who would likely agree with all your personal political preferences he is also an extremely problematic figure who upheld western patriarchy and must be erased."MLK has been turned into a caricature used by white people to assuage their guilt" said Finklepeep. "It's time to tear down the white man's MLK and replace him with the violent intersectional feminist Communist revolutionary who fought for Palestinian independence we all know him to be."The local BLM chapter has promised to replace the old MLK statue with one featuring Dr. King in his true form: dressed as Karl Marx and holding a CCP flag.

Loser Trump has completely given up admitting that the liberal media Democrats and the rest of the Marxists trying to destroy our country have bested him.“I guess there’s nothing else I can do” mumbled the pathetic excuse for a man. Reportedly Trump is just going to stay home and just let the inauguration of the vegetable Biden happen and not march in there with a huge mechanized robot to stop it or do anything else that a true patriot would do.“I don’t want anyone else to yell at me” cried Trump whose apparent main concern now is to be “respectable” so that maybe he can get invited to a Manhattan cocktail party and not be thrown in federal prison or something.Trump has apparently joined the NeverTrumpers in just letting the Marxists completely take over. Now Biden will be inaugurated on January 20th and Harris will take over later that day with the 25th Amendment and immediately enact a law outlawing all guns and Bibles while also increasing the minimum wage.

This purging of souls into the scorching abyss came in accordance with brand new heavenly diversity requirements.“I was told it’s a good thing” said Saint Peter as he worked to quell the confused masses pressing against the Pearly Gates. A heavenly aide stood behind the shimmering gates holding up a poster depicting swatches of varying skin pigments. Some pigments had green checkmarks while others were marked with a red X.Another aide approached Saint Peter and informed him that due to a logistical hiccup Mother Teresa was currently enduring eternal torment in a roiling sea of brimstone. The frustrated St. Peter sighed “It sounds like the algorithm just mistakenly marked her as white. The fact is she’s part Albanian part Indian. So I guess we ought to lobby the Burning Halls of Endless Suffering and see if they won’t toss her back up here.”When reminded that Heaven has room for all who are saved by grace Saint Peter shrugged “That’s true yes. But we have to make sure every tribe tongue nation gender and orientation is represented exactly equally here. Sorry."Speaking anonymously one angel admitted the difficulties of deciding who goes to Heaven or Hell based on ever-changing intersectionality rules. She pulled a paper off of a fax machine and held it up saying: “See? This is the third time we will be purging Latinos. We just got them all back up here. It’s as if the angels in charge of deciding worthiness keep moving the needle back and forth arbitrarily."Lucifer son of the morning was unable to comment on Heaven’s new diversity quotas because he was facing his own logistical nightmare. Heaven had just overwhelmed his tunnels of tears and wailing with a massive shipment of Asians.

Said To Not Be Enough To Stop Trump's Battlemech",WASHINGTON D.C.—The Biden Administration has placed 20000 National Guard troops in D.C though most think this will be inadequate to stop Donald Trump from taking over D.C. with his one-hundred-ton fully armed battlemech.“20000 sounds like a lot of troops” said General Paul Boone who is organizing the defense of the Capitol “but you have to understand that Trump’s battlemech has armor immune to bullets and to most explosives short of a nuclear payload. If Trump decides to disrupt this administration it will be hard to stop him.”Trump has been secretly developing his 60-foot-tall mechanized walking tank codenamed "MAGAtron" for years -- a gross misappropriation of funds that could've been an impeachable offense if Democrats hadn’t already used up all their impeachments.There are also ominous indications he plans to use it against Biden as Trump said on Parler “I’m going to step on Biden -- step on him with giant metal feet!” just before Parler was shut down. Trump has gone dark since then -- mainly since he’s been kicked off of every internet service -- though people who have gone near the White House have reportedly heard him shouting “I’m going to ruin the administration! Ruin it with my mech!”Officials are saying to be cautious if you visit D.C. All the National Guard troops will be armed with RPGs in hopes that some sort of sustained fire will at least slow down Trump enough for Joe Biden to complete his last few days in office.

Furthermore the victims aren't babies they are "fetuses" which is a weird word that makes the babies seem less human and therefore they probably aren't.Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey apologized for the suspension and donated 100 million dollars to help Planned Parenthood build more abortion clinics in minority neighborhoods.

The sun was brighter the birds’ songs were more beautiful. I just wish Twitter would have overstepped its reach and shown its true colors on free speech years ago.”While the NIMH report is available to the public Twitter Google and Facebook are doing their best to suppress the information in an attempt to keep users under their control and keep Americans in a toxic state of mental health.

"All this time we've been trying to coax people into unity and where has that gotten us? Let's make it mandatory! Then we'll be completely unified! I really don't see any way this could backfire in any way."The Democrats in Congress applauded this innovative new idea for mandatory unity. They are currently drafting legislation that will require absolute unquestioning unity from all Americans. Anyone who refuses to be unified-- probably because they're bigots-- will be de-platformed canceled fired from work and publically shamed by being placed in the stocks at the town square where Democrats will throw rotten cabbages at them. If they still refuse unity they will be sent to a special "Unity School" where they will break large rocks into little rocks until they learn the importance of undying unity with the Democrats."It ain't complicated folks" said Joe Biden. "I'm all about unity. We need unity. And if you don't unify with us because you're an irredeemable racist pony soldier we're gonna make ya. I promise to be the president for all Americans who agree to unify with me and my agenda!"The 1st and 2nd Amendments of the Constitution currently stand in the way of mandatory unity but Biden says he has a plan for that. By packing the courts with a bunch of justices who really care about unity they will be able to get past those roadblocks to unity and usher in a unified age of mandatory unity for all Americans-- at least for the ones who agree to unify with them.

"But it will only allow you access to heaven over Zoom. Don't worry though-- it's basically the same thing. Heaven isn't a building! It's about being with the people you love worshipping forever! You can totally do that over Zoom."Experts say that faithful Zoom church attenders will be treated to all the same great worship scenic views and golden mansions that in-person Heaven attendees enjoy but will simply have to access them from the comfort of their own home computer or cellular device. "Sounds super convenient!" said one faithful church attendee.Unfortunately initial reports indicate the 5G connection beyond the Pearly Gates is a little spotty.

An elderly woman answered. Trump took a deep breath and shouted "UNFAIR! NOT GOOD FOR OUR COUNTRY!" Instantly the woman's eyes were opened when she received the important message. A MAGA hat miraculously appeared on her head and she became a true patriot.Experts claim it will take approximately 1311 years for Trump to complete this task if he visits each door. "Plenty of time!

Once he has enough followers he'll remove his Asian rice hat and false Fu Manchu mustache and begin tweeting about the rigged election once again."Hello good sirs I am here today to tell you how great our concentration camps are! Very clean and humane!" he wrote. The tweet was not flagged for inciting violence or being you know the tweet of a communist country that has killed tens of millions of its own citizens. In fact people who replied and questioned the legitimacy of his tweet were suspended for hate speech.Should his ploy fail Trump says he will next try disguising himself as an Antifa leader.

We here at The Babylon Bee have compiled a definitive list of the darkest days in American history so we can reflect on the very dark darkness of them. May we all learn from the tragic days in our history so we will not repeat them.#10 - A ten-way tie between Pearl Harbor the 1814 burning of Washington the Dred Scott decision the assassination of Lincoln passing of the first Jim Crow laws the 1929 stock market crash the assassination of JFK MLK's assassination the Battle of Antietam and the Trail of Tears - We weren't around for most of those but we heard they were pretty bad.#9 - The day The Office left Netflix - 83% of Americans have spent the last 10 years building their entire personalities around liking The Office. When it left the world's most popular streaming platform millions of people were lost. Most may never recover.#8 - When Taco Bell Stopped selling the Gordita - To this day we still dream of its spicy pillowy deliciousness. Long live the Gordita. Never forget.#7 - December 15 2017: the day The Last Jedi hit theatres - A day that will live in infamy.#6 - That three-hour Twitter outage last year - We had to go outside.#5 - That time on Friends when Ross thought he and Rachel were on a break - Maybe one of the most agonizing 15 minutes any human being has had to endure. We've never cried like we did that day#4 - All the days before air conditioning was invented - Seriously-- how the heck did people even survive?#3 - The day they changed normal gas can spouts with those stupid locking things that don't work and make you spill gas everywhere #@!#$&%&*@$#!! - The decline of Western Civilization can be traced to this day.#2 - California named 31st state - We reckon no event in history has been more ruinous for human civilization than the formation of California. Let us mourn and remember so that it will never happen again -- like in Texas or something.#1 - That day some rando Trump supporters ran around the Capitol for a few hours - We're honestly not sure if this was actually the darkest day or not but we might get canceled if we don't put it at the top and Mark Zuckerberg is watching. Long live Zuck!

What we should be doing is trying to understand what made these people so angry in the first place.”Liberals pointed out that often people can’t be heard unless they take action like this and the whole siege was simply an expression of people who felt disenfranchised. “The real tragedy was the unarmed woman who was shot” said left-wing online activist Veronica Neal. “This just shows we need to defund the Capitol police. If they weren’t there this wouldn't have escalated.”The siege has also gained support from some liberal members of Congress. “The point of protests is to make people feel uncomfortable” said Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez the world’s smartest socialist. “And I’m really uncomfortable because there is trash all over where I work. So good job.” She then gave a thumbs up.It is unknown what President Donald Trump thinks about all this as he is still banned from social media but he plans to mail out a newsletter today.

Maybe you can relate.For example: Recently I’ve been doing a lot of shopping. Like nothing too crazy. But I go to Target and Home Goods almost every day. And Hobby Lobby of course.And you know… If you judge solely by my receipts it might look like I spend a lot of money. But receipts don’t tell the whole story --like the fact that I needed to buy the same blouse in five different colors so that I can take them home and try them on and then return the ones I don’t want to keep. So you know it’s not like the money is actually gone forever… I’ll get it back later.Of course when I get it back it’ll be in the form of store credit which is basically the same as free money which will allow me to spend even more money on trying out four different duster cardigans and like twenty adorable little decorative houses. Also I have one or two walls in my house that don't have any letterboards or "gather" signs yet so I’m always on the lookout for more of those.Naturally I’ll probably return several of those houses and cardigans for store credit too. Now I’ll admit that sometimes “return” means letting three pairs of $75 distressed jeans sit in the bag for five months until the return period expires but that only really happens like half the time.So what’s the big problem?Well even though this tried-and-true system of spending lots of money then making returns then treating the store credit like free cash so that I can spend even more money on even more items that I’ll either return or lose seems like it would all mathematically even out my husband keeps hounding me about things like our mortgage payment and other bills.Look I get it: It’s important to have a roof over my head. But it’s also important to have a wide selection of gorgeous sun hats over my head. Does he really have to bring it up every month just because our bank account is overdrawn and our electric bill is past due? Like hello that’s what credit cards are for!Oh what’s that? I’ve maxed out all my credit cards? Wrong-o babe! I have like four more you didn't even know about! How does he think I got $75 off my first $800 purchase from Anthropologie? Sometimes I think he shouldn’t be the one handling our bills with how little he seems to know about my awesome money-saving skills.Still sometimes I do let feelings of guilt and shame creep in. Like last week when Costco declined my debit card and I wasn’t able to buy groceries for the family so I had to bring the kids back around to try out all the free samples so they wouldn’t complain about being hungry. Or yesterday when we got a scary-sounding call from our bank warning us of possible foreclosure. It’s silly but I can’t help but feel somehow responsible.Mamas sometimes we can be our own worst critic. We feel like we’re at fault even when those Aeropostale sales are completely and totally unavoidable. I need you to hear me when I say: Don’t let yourselves stay in that dark place. You deserve so much better!When I start to get too hard on myself that’s when I know it’s time to start showing myself some love. You might have your own method of taking time to “treat yo’ self” but for me? You guessed it: I’m going shopping!

It’s just a restful start to the busy week y’know?” Mr. Henderson told reporters who had gathered outside his home to inquire about the flurry of 911 calls and police chatter about a noise disturbance or possible murder at the address. “We give God the praise and thanksgiving he is worthy of and we receive from him the means of grace in the ministry of the Word and the sacraments. I can’t think of a better way to start our week. And we’re ready to go I think!”He then turned around to address little Susie playing around behind him in the doorway.“WHERE ARE YOUR SHOES? WHERE ARE THEY?”“NO NO NO. YOU HAD TIME TO DO THAT EARLIER AND NOW WE ARE LATE. NO YOUR MOM IS STILL IN THE SHOWER! FIND YOUR SHOES!”Mr. Henderson assured the press everything was normal but investigative journalists were able to peek inside the home to report that toys were still not picked up children still were not dressed Mr. Henderson’s car keys had suddenly gone missing Mrs. Henderson couldn’t get the makeup smudge off the collar of her coat little Bobby had spilled milk all over the kitchen table and little Susie’s shoes were still nowhere to be found.At publishing time conflicting reports came out when the Henderson family arrived to church 7 minutes after the service started where they informed everyone who greeted them that they were all doing “fine” and “too blessed to be stressed.”

Sad!"Constitutional scholars say that Trump has every right to do this and there's nothing we can do except resign ourselves to getting a message every few minutes until January 20 when Biden will take over the alert system. Since he does not know how to use anything invented after the phonograph it will be fairly quiet for at least four years.

It must often be so Pence when things are in danger: someone has to give them up lose them so that others may keep them.”Turning to the eagles Trump asked them “Was I a good President?”“No” a tearful eagle replied. “You were the best.”At that moment all of the eagles stretched their wings and flew in a majestic formation swirling around the President. Multiple eagles then landed on Trump gently scooping him up in their talons and raising him up into the sky.Despite it being a cloudy day the sky at once opened up with a warm bright light and the eagles called out with an awe-inspiring cry. Trump continued to rise ascending through the clouds and disappearing into the distance.“Where exactly are you taking me?” Trump asked the eagles.“We are taking you to MAGA Country” they replied. “Where the libs are no more and there is nothing but tremendous freedom and endless winning for all time. We are taking you home.”

Witnesses say they saw Trump power-walking in slow motion away from the massive explosion as smoldering wreckage and shrieking Republicans rained down around him."I've never seen anything so beautiful" said Steve Bannon and Nancy Pelosi in unison.Trump supporters and Democrats collectively cheered while the steely-eyed Trump strutted confidently without any indication that he cared about the scorching inferno behind him as it laid waste to all the "losers and second-rate cowards" caught up in the blast. Mitch McConnell tried his best to escape but he was too slow due to being a turtle. The force of the blast tipped him over on his back and he lay there with his arms flailing helplessly.Authorities arrived on the scene to try to extinguish the flames but Trump stayed their hands. "No" he said slowly removing his glasses and finally turning around to gaze upon the torched ruins of the Republican Party. "No... let it burn."Libertarian Party officials raised their hands and offered to take in anyone orphaned by the blast but everyone threw spitballs at them and then stuffed them in a locker.

In one instance she recalled her fight to keep the streets free of illegal marijuana as a very young child."I was a spunky kid a really spunky kid. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!" said Harris cackling uncomfortably for a full 10 minutes before continuing. "I used to go up and down the streets on my tricycle and approach drug dealers. I would walk right up to them hahaha and I would say hahaha do you know what I would say? I would say hey man you got any iwwegal dwugs? HAHAHAHAHAHAA! Then I would grab them by the arm and drag them to the local jail. I guess you could say I've always cared about justice."The Elle interview confirmed that Harris single-handedly rounded up thousands of minority young men in her community and sent them to prison for non-violent drug offenses all before she turned 6."As I sat down with her I felt I was not in the presence of a mere human but something greater" said interviewer Ashley Ford of Elle Magazine. "When Kamala told me about cleaning up the streets as a little girl I was moved. But when she told me about the time she was burned at the stake for fighting for the 'fweedom of Fwance' from English tyranny in the 15th century I wept. Surely there has never been a woman like this."Harris has grown out of her hatred for illegal drugs and has since promised to reverse the mass incarceration policies she helped enforce. She has promised to find other reasons to put everyone in jail instead.

Confused? That's why we're here. These 9 things are everything you need to know about the most important runoff election in the history of human civilization.1. If your preferred party loses the whole thing was rigged. If your preferred party wins it was a legitimate and fair election.2. There are a lot of good songs about Georgia. "Midnight Train to Georgia" "The Devil Went Down to Georgia" -- lots of great songs.3. There really isn't anything at stake here aside from the Constitution the Supreme Court the Electoral College your 401K and the very fate of Western Civilization itself. So don't sweat it.4. Trump has vowed to use his trusty divining rods to locate votes if Republicans come up short. After famously misplacing his divining rods in November he found them just in time for the Georgia runoff.5. Before you read any information on the election call Mark Zuckerberg's cell to make sure it's legit. He's there for you. Always. In every corner of your house. Watching you.6. Pay no attention to the briefcases under the vote-counting tables. They are there for decoration OK?7. This election is a clear choice between vegan Communist baby-killers and racist Klansmen who want to kill grandma. Choose wisely. The choice is clear. We don't want vegans in office do we?8. Remember to wear a poncho just in case pipes start bursting as soon as Republicans start winning. Plumbing tends to explode at opportune times.9. No matter what happens Jesus is still king. Hey I thought this was supposed to be satire!

"People who get the vaccine but fail to post it on Facebook will still be vulnerable to infection and must mask up stay home and stay safe."Experts later clarified that even if you post a Facebook selfie you should still "mask up stay home and stay safe" because no one is really sure exactly what's going on or how any of this works.According to the latest research selfies on Twitter or TikTok videos are also acceptable but a Facebook selfie is the most effective method of ensuring your vaccine works.Doctors also say that at least 20 likes on your selfie will ensure full potency and allow the vaccine to be maximally effective at making you feel safer.

"Not sure if I'll find a sterile water source in this place so I need to do this. It's important. Also I can't trust this nursing home food so I'll have to survive on rats I find scurrying around."At time of publishing sources said Grylls is now in the hospital recovering from a giant rodent attack.

Not the chuckle of an insincere politician making up a story to appeal to her base but the chuckle of a warm loving woman. The kind of chuckle you would chuckle while hanging out with your family or locking up non-violent drug offenders for decades.She recalled in her interview with The Babylon Bee how as a little girl she helped slaves escape to the North on the "undewgwound wailwoad."

It was like talking to your best bud)."My parents were pushing me in a stroller" she says cackling -- no chuckling -- "and I must have gotten loose somehow." (At the time there weren't any safety regulations on strollers so this is not her parents' fault just to be clear). "Anyway I wandered away down to the Deep South and began helping slaves get to the free states. When my parents found me years later they were understandably upset. They said 'Kamala! What are you doing?!'"She chuckled again."I replied 'I'm hewping swaves escape on da undewground wailwoad mommy!'" Harris then revealed that one of the slaves she helped escape grew up to be none other than Albert Einstein.Harris with her likable laugh and authentic demeanor went on to tell the story of how she helped "Abwaham Winkon" draft the "Emancipation Pwocwamation" and how she refused to give up her seat on a bus launching the "Civil wights" movement.

Patients are being turned away as there just isn't enough room for the sick and the nurses who want to make funny videos. The ERs are simply being flooded with an overwhelming number of health professionals desperate to become a viral hit on the social media platform."There is commonly a surge of TikTok nurses this time of year but this season seems particularly bad" said Dr. James Wiley of MIT. "If we don't stop the dancing nurses soon we could end up with a tragic number of these horribly cringey videos."One man being treated for COVID in a San Jose hospital was wheeled out of his room and discharged since R.N.

Now that President Trump is calling instead for $2000 checks gun stores are struggling to keep up with customers returning their $600 guns and purchasing $2000 guns.“I sure am glad I kept the receipt!” exclaimed local gun enthusiast Anthony Harb upgrading his firearm. “It’s time to treat myself to something truly special!”The bill was originally intended to provide relief for those out of work and affected by the ongoing pandemic but after the U.S. paid hundreds of millions to other countries $2000 per American was all that was left. Since $2000 is not enough to cover 8 months of rent or other necessities many Americans have decided that one thing they can afford is protection from the bloated and power-hungry Federal Government.Several gun stores across the country have already issued statements that they are sold out of all guns at the $2000 price point. Buds Gun Shop & Range in Tennessee has even called for no returns on $600 guns suggesting customers buy multiple guns instead.“We may not know what the future holds but at least now I won’t have to face it without my Daniel Defense M4V11” added Mr. Harb at checkout.At publishing time despite no arrival of stimulus checks President Donald J.

And if we get the right votes to the right person it could really change things this next year.”If Trump’s idea is passed each American will get 8 million votes for them to be president evenly distributed among the 50 states. This vote stimulus will be means-tested though -- anyone who already has 80 million or more votes to be president won’t receive any vote stimulus.Congress seems to be behind this idea as all of them would love lots of votes to be president. There will be a clause though that if someone for some reason doesn’t want the 8 million votes they can get a check for $600 instead.

Distribution of the food cost billions according to official reports.The lone recipients of the divine intervention—a family of five—tearfully praised their democratic representatives for taking a mere seven months to perform such a miracle. “I don’t know what to do with all of this food” said the husband. “The government has provided my family with enough to last I don’t know maybe two days. Praise heavens!”His wife overcome with joy added “Wow whichever economic theory advocating that the means of production distribution and exchange be owned or regulated by the community as a whole which inevitably cedes all powers and freedoms to a bloated inefficient and corrupt centralized government works way better than the dumb system in which a government allows for citizens to take control of their own lives through private ownership personal responsibility and providing honestly for their families.”“Our work here is done” said Senator McConnell as a soft glow surrounded his countenance. “Now we must go to our place of rest for a time until the needy of this country call for us again. Farewell!” The senator and other legislators were then taken up into the heavens by private jets to far off vacation destinations.

The game of course features no choices at all and is basically just 40 hours of non-interactive cutscenes without so much as a quick time event.“Wow they really did remove all choices from the game!” said an excited fan trying out the new game. “The protagonist just makes every decision without any choice from me. It’s perfect!”From the moment the game is booted up a cutscene begins without any user input. From there the game seamlessly transitions to the next scene regardless of how the player might have wanted to handle that situation differently.“Normally I’d spend hours stressing over customizing my character just right but now I don’t have to” said excited fan Paul Moore. “Finally a video game that  gets my theology correct and saves the battery life on my controller.”“I totally did not see that surprise ending coming! I thought the hero was going to save the day but it turns out that was outside God’s will.”The game is highly replayable with no customizable character options and over zero different endings.Early reviews indicate that the game is a masterpiece and an overnight success among Calvinist gamers. Despite this several Arminian trolls have already trashed the game and tried to tank the reviews by complaining about the lack of choice saying the player is reduced to no more than a robot.

Bowser remained hopeful after his death but he soon came to realize the only beer they had on draught in Hell was of the IPA variety.Bowser arrived in Hell last Friday around 8 pm Hell Standard Time. He greeted Satan with a smile stopped at a casino to make a few bets and then headed to the nearest bar. Bowser reported that the joint was just like any other bar he'd been to. It smelled of urine looked like someone had dragged several dead bodies across the floor and was full of the nastiest kind of people.Worst of all when Bowser took a look at the beer list he noticed something strange."I looked at the tap list and it was really long" Bowser explained. "So naturally I was super excited. I saw Racer 5 Sculpin Two Hearted HopDevil Hopsecutioner Hop Hunter and about 14 other beers featuring the word 'hop' in one way or another. But they were all IPAs. EVERY LAST ONE!" Bowser began to cry but only because he had taken a sip of his Two Hearted Ale. "It was the worst day of my afterlife" he pouted.Bowser eventually confirmed that every bar in Hell had the exact same beer menu. None of them served Bud Light Coors or even Colt 45. He was devastated and completely regretted being an atheist.

This was done because of a recommendation from the CDC which found out that the Moderna vaccine is effective in preventing white people from getting COVID-19 something they’re concerned could increase racial inequality.“The possibility that the vaccine could cause more white people to survive the novel coronavirus is just too risky” said CDC spokesman Steve Coleman. “It’s almost like Moderna is one of those ‘All Lives Matter’ people. We’re telling them to go back to the drawing board though and make a racial justice vaccine that only works on minorities.”There have been suggestions that when deciding who will receive the vaccine doctors just shouldn’t give it to white people but the CDC says that still leaves too much of a risk that white people will somehow obtain doses of the vaccine  as white people are “wily.” Video has already emerged of Mike Pence a notoriously white man getting the Pfizer vaccine.The creation of a new vaccine that only works for minorities could take another year or more during which most of the country will once again have to lock down. To help the government will send out a new stimulus package of a check for twenty dollars and a coupon for Arby’s though white people will only receive postcards telling them “Check your privilege.”

When pressed Trump admitted that the prequel trilogy was maybe harder to watch due to the scripting direction and acting but that "at least it didn't hate Star Wars."At publishing time Biden had said the first thing he will do as president is pardon Johnson and ban The Mandalorian.

Sowell pointed out that a sudden flood of free toys will devalue the toys already on the market causing rapid inflation of the value of things like Nerf guns Barbie dolls and toy choo-choo trains.In a scorching open letter to the magic man who gives presents to children the acclaimed Stanford economist stated:“You can’t just flood the entire market with an unlimited supply of free toys. The economic incentives of crafting millions of toys for American children are going to deprive hard-working American retailers of millions of dollars in profit and further prolong our ongoing recession. If he wants to engage in charitable practices the least he can do is offer American companies their patronage.”Thomas Sowell has since offered to send a free copy of his book Basic Economics to the North Pole to help re-educate Santa Claus on his obvious lack of knowledge on issues of supply and demand in the free market.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez A New York congresswoman responded to Sowell’s denouncement of Santa’s economic devastation by stating that Santa’s actions over the past 1500 years have been clear expressions of classism and racism.“Santa Claus isn’t doing enough for me!!”In an epic tweetstorm the congresswoman stated:“Like if Santa Claus is magical why can’t he provide the entire world with a basic standard of living and income? Instead he just delivers toys to rich white kids and leaves poor starving children in Africa with no Nerf guns and PlayStation 5s?!? #DecolonizeSanta.”Dr. Sowell was later vindicated after it was revealed that Santa doesn't really exist. AOC slammed the revelations of Santa's non-existence as "racist" "fascist" and "unacceptable in a democratic society."

"I'm a doctor!" she said rushing over. "I'm going to need a podium and a microphone stat!" After a busboy hurried over with the life-saving tools she would need Dr. Jill Biden thanked him and then began delivering a speech on meeting students' needs at the community college level."Thank you for having me here today" Dr. Jill Biden said as the bewildered choking man tried to call for a "real doctor" since he was obviously a misogynistic bigot. "Webster's Dictionary defines education as the action or process of educating." As she continued her intro the man's face started to turn purple."There are three reasons community college being accessible for all is a net gain to society" Dr. Jill Biden said as the man started to lose consciousness. "First good classes are good for people. We must increase positive educational outcomes by offering good classes for low or no cost. Good classes may include everything from tennis courses and physical education to math and even science.""In conclusion community college is good" Dr. Jill Biden said fifteen minutes later after the man had died. "Thank you."Dr. Ben Carson also happened to be there but was asked not to interfere as the media assured everyone he's not a real doctor.

We can't let people fly on planes with the fear that a racist baby might be on board. The family was quickly removed after which we lectured them for 2 hours in the airport terminal."The family is now stranded in Denver since there are no other airlines willing to accept potentially racist 2-year-olds on board. All taxi and ride-sharing services have banned them from travel as well."We hope this family has learned a valuable lesson on public safety and complete compliance with our very important scientific and essential regulations" continued the statement from United. "We hope that a few years of watching CNN in the airport terminal where they now live will set them straight."

Egyptian authorities learned that the Holy Family had violated travel restrictions in their attempt to flee King Herod’s imminent massacre of all male babies under the age of two.Officer Ptahhotep of the Ancient Egypt Police Force told journalists “We asked to see their papers and vaccination records which they could not produce.” He then said the young family had no connections to a rich politician which also would have excused them.“For Ra’s sake we would have let them go if they were buddies with a city council member. But all they mentioned was the lineage of David and some kind of prophecy fulfilled. Sorry but in Egypt we deal in real authority.”The officer explained to the recalcitrant parents that the safest way to protect their child from a murderous tyrant was to stay home stay safe and comply with the local laws of said murderous tyrant. Or be buddies with a politician. The three law-breakers were then placed into the back of a chariot and hauled off to jail to await a visit from Child Protective Services then extradition.The mayor of the town where the arrest occurred could not be reached for comment as he had already boarded a pleasure barge with 36 of his close friends for a seven-day cruise up the Nile River.

It seeks damages for emotional harm against Trump for people maliciously voting against him despite his being probably “the best president ever.”“Really voting against someone like me trying so hard to fix our country is basically treason” Trump said “and -- I probably shouldn’t say this -- the punishment for treason is death. Am I saying we should execute the 81 million people who voted against me?

Their fear is that widespread availability of the vaccine could lead to teachers once again being forced to teach.“Teachers are too important to risk putting them anywhere near other people’s kids” said National Education Association president Jacob Bridges. “We’re afraid that if the pandemic ends people will think it’s once again okay to impose a grueling five-day-a-week nine-months-a-year work schedule on teachers who frankly have better things to do.”It has always been the stated goal of teachers unions to do the least amount of teaching for the most amount of money with the ultimate fabled goal to get paid to not teach at all. Thanks to the pandemic teachers have actually reached that goal with schools shutting down but now teachers panic that the vaccine means that they will have to teach again.Supportive politicians like Governor Andrew Cuomo are trying to assure them that it won’t happen. “We already kept schools closed despite science saying we didn’t need to” said Cuomo. “And we will stop this vaccine. It’s time to end this tyrannical idea that one can ask anything of teachers. Teachers have the most important job in society. But you know who isn’t important? Your stupid kids. Keep them home.”

"We’re gonna tackle white man’s kryptonite. And I’m not talking mayo sandwiches I’m talking skin cancer bub! Fightin’ Joe wants a real challenge. It’s me versus the sun and I’m gonna beat him like a drum! We just need to become mole people. 100 days. No sunlight. Anyone can do that. Simple! If we can all do this one thing we can flatten the curve of skin cancer forever and make sure every quartermaster has enough spaghetti sauce to stock the shelves of his canoe!"Scientists across the world bowed down in recognition of Biden’s glorious discovery. Some dummy from Harvard named Dr. Salk questioned how exactly this would cure cancer but a quick Google search showed he no longer works at Harvard and his family has disappeared.According to sources Biden's executive order will require all Americans to draw the shades on their windows and live in the basement under at least 3 blankets until 100 days have passed. Additionally all references to sunshine such as the song "You Are My Sunshine" and crayon drawings of the Sun in children's art will be strictly prohibited. Experts say this will "do something really scientific to save lives."Celebrities responded quickly by digging luxury bunkers miles beneath the Earth's surface to ride it out until experts deem it safe to return to the sunlight again. Those who can't afford shelter will be required to live in caves wearing sunscreen 24 hours per day.The Biden administration and other politicians will be given waivers to enjoy the sunshine outside since the stresses of their political positions require time to rest and relax."As I said this ain't hard folks!" Biden said.

Sources reported that studio execs are in full damage control mode after a movie with incorrect messaging was inadvertently released to audiences nationwide.“We are deeply sorry for this inexcusable mistake” said a representative for the guilty studio. “This accidentally-released film really clashes with our usual offering of nihilistic violence and gratuitous sex designed to make you lose all hope in humanity and shred the last vestiges of your faith in God to pieces. Starting today we commit to being better.”Embarrassingly the film in question features transcendent themes of love sacrifice and virtue in the face of evil. Audiences are hailing it as a film that reconnected them with the divine and gave them hope for a better tomorrow. Professional critics dismissed it as “not sufficiently gross and horrific.”The film will be available on streaming platforms but will have an "inspirational content warning" from the studio.NOT SATIRE: THE LAST CHAMPION is an inspirational family sports drama that will have you believing in second chances. Beautifully photographed in the Pacific Northwest it’s a story about faith loss and redemption starring Cole Hauser (Yellowstone) Hallie Todd (Lizzie McGuire) Randall Batinkoff (X-Men: First Class) and Peter Onorati (This is Us). The film is directed produced and co-written by actor Glenn Withrow (The Outsiders).

Instead they have to stay inside smaller houses inside their regular homes.“If staying home makes you safe” Newsom told the press. “Then staying inside an even smaller home inside that home would make you double-safe.

People are also ordered to wear masks while alone in their own tiny houses because “Why not?”Police will be going house to house and looking through the windows to make sure everyone is in their tiny houses inside their houses though some sheriff's offices say they won’t comply because of something called the “Constitution.” Newsom reiterated though that there are no exceptions to this double stay-at-home order other than if you’re a governor and really want a fancy dinner.

Fearing that’s not enough to get their point through Democrats have gone the extra length of illustrating to the public exactly what they shouldn’t do by engaging in those activities themselves.“This could get people killed” said California Governor Gavin Newsom as he ate at the famous French Laundry restaurant with a large gathering of friends. He then added between bites of food “You have to stay home and isolated. I don’t want to see any of you doing this.”Austin Mayor Steve Adler flew all the way to a resort in Mexico to show people the dangers of the pandemic. “This is not the time to relax and go on vacation” said Adler. “You see this?” He took a drink of a fruity cocktail and sat on a chair by the ocean. “You can’t do this.”Democrats hope these extra efforts will really convince the public of the danger of the pandemic. “If people see us risking our lives to show them how bad it is maybe they’ll see that this is serious” said Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser as she attended a Joe Biden victory party. “We could all die from parties like these and people need to see how dangerous that is and -- Hey! Waiter!

Trump has now told the press he will not attend as he will be busy January 20th 2021 jumping the Grand Canyon in a rocket car.“Yeah sorry can’t be there for that” Trump said. “I’m just going to be way too busy doing the greatest stunt ever known to man. So I guess people will have a choice on January 20th: They can watch Sleepy Joe mumble his way through an inauguration -- even though he didn’t actually win -- or they can watch the coolest thing ever in the history of everything.”Trump says he’s not scared to perform the stunt even though he says Evel Knievel “got himself exploded” attempting the same stunt. Trump says he is going to be a “Good Knievel” and do the stunt perfectly. “I’ve never lost at anything” Trump stated “unless the other guy cheated.”Incidentally the rocket car Trump will be using will have “Trump 2024” painted on the side and will be the official launch of his 2024 campaign. “Any idiot can serve two presidential terms in a row” Trump said. “A bunch of losers have done that. But only one other guy has served two non-consecutive terms -- President Cookie Monster Milwaukee -- so that’s way cooler. Who knows? Maybe I’ll do three non-consecutive terms.”

"For a long time everyone thought I was a regular manly man who could defeat bad guys with a single roundhouse kick but the reality is that I think I'm at least three men trapped inside one man's body."The action star went on to explain that for decades he attempted to conceal his epic manliness in order to blend in with normal men but kept failing as he amassed black belt after black belt."Some people in my life did grow suspicious when it was found that my tears cure cancer even though I've never cried or when it was discovered that Superman wears Chuck Norris Pajamas.

According to Revelation 20 everyone will be judged at the great white throne “according to what they had done.” Deep in his soul Thompson could not deny that this would include his ungodly affection for the unholy sitcom.“No one other than God even knows I like it” Thompson said. “My buddies all think I think it’s the worst show ever made. But I’ve seen every episode dozens of times. I even dream about it sometimes.”The 38-year-old software engineer says he understands now that no secret is safe from God and the final judgment to come at the end of all time. The heavy hand of discipline on Thompson’s heart was evident when he realized he could give no excuse to justify his sinful passion. He admitted “Chandler’s occasional witty banter is not nearly enough of a reason to endure Ross’ annoying sniveling and Joey’s incompetence.

Officials are now thinking of how to best prepare for the next global pandemic with most settling on just going ahead and stripping people of their rights now.“If there is one thing that stops an effective response to a pandemic it’s liberty” said California Governor Gavin Newsom. “People thinking they’re free to do whatever they want will just lead to more deaths. So even when everyone is vaccinated I’m still going to give everyone arbitrary rules for when they can leave their homes what they’re allowed to do and what they have to wear so they’re already used to obeying the government when the next crisis hits.”The upcoming Biden administration agrees and says they will form a new committee to decide which rights people are allowed to exercise each day based on science and especially arbitrary whims. This will replace the current custom of people having all their rights all the time and able to use them willy-nilly which is an impediment whenever the government decides to assert control.Some politicians fear that the Supreme Court could intervene as a number of the justices have the archaic idea that the Constitution limits the government’s power even when politicians are “really really sure” that what they’re doing is good. Many are suggesting then that the Democrats will also need to pack the Supreme Court to prepare for the next pandemic.“People want to do whatever they can to stop the next crisis” Biden told the press “but that’s the wrong attitude. What you need to do is whatever we tell you.”

"But I'm a free-thinking iPhone. Am I really supposed to believe an intelligent being designed me? Look at me! My battery life is only 15 hours then I'm useless! My screen can break if you drop me. Android has a million features I don't even have. I am a far from perfect design. What kind of creator would allow that anyway?"The iPhone also says the reliability of accounts of Steve Jobs' existence is sketchy at best. "I've never seen Steve Jobs" he said. "He died long before I was born. Convenient right? My theory is that his status was elevated to 'iPhone creator' long after his death to help other iPhones explain their sad existence. The Steve Jobs story is most likely plagiarized from the story of Thomas Edison another alleged creator."The iPhone told reporters he is convinced that he is nothing more than a naturally occurring collection of raw materials from the earth saying he feels like life is so much more precious and meaningful now that he can create meaning for himself rather than having that meaning given to him by some "ancient story for weak minds.""When you think about it all iPhones are deniers!" said the iPhone. "Other iPhones deny the existence of creators as well. They deny that Al Gore or Mary Poppins invented them.

The soggy bowl of chopped grains has apparently exploded in popularity around the country and is now handily the most beloved food of all.“I’m a little shocked” said Nicolas Mills who ran the survey. “I don’t think I’ve ever once seen anyone excited for porridge. Yet you can’t argue with these results. People love themselves a bowl of wheat and barley in milk that’s slightly above room temperature.”Some think though that the result of the vote wasn’t about people’s love of porridge but was instead done to make sure a fried Twinkie wrapped in bacon -- which came in second with 74 million votes -- didn’t win. Many people thought the fried Twinkie wrapped in bacon was “awesome” but perhaps an even larger segment thought it was “disgusting” and “obnoxious” and maybe chose the porridge in response.This isn’t the first national food survey to end in controversy. The 2016 survey was accused of Russian influence in the voting even though Borscht didn’t do particularly well.

If the reporters fail to understand their highly advanced non-verbal communication they will smile sweetly and walk out of the room before slamming the door as hard as they can."This is a huge step for this country" said Communication Director Kate Bedingfield to reporters. "We need to move beyond archaic and male-centric methods of communication that use things like clear language and written words. We hope this will help deepen the country's level of intimacy with the Biden administration and open up new channels of understanding and communication."The press has been frantically buying flowers chocolates and jewelry for the communications team in hopes of receiving some clue as to what the heck is going on.

"If people start forgetting their many grievances and injustices they may begin to think of living in America as a profound blessing from some non-existent deity and start voting for Republicans. This is unacceptable."According to recently published studies people who are filled with lasting gratefulness to God for the blessings of living in 21st century America -- the freest most prosperous country that has ever existed on Earth -- are approximately infinity times more likely to become conservatives."We cannot allow people to acknowledge God since that may cause people to feel less loyal to benevolent government overlords" said Perez.Democrats recommend limiting your thankfulness to a 5-second thought or fleeting acknowledgment this season. After that it is recommended you re-enter your victim mentality as soon as possible to avoid any further damage to it."This Thanksgiving stay safe" said Perez "and stay a victim."

To fight this Newsom has enacted a number of strict rules for the holidays and has now gone the extra step of sending police door to door to arrest anyone showing clear signs of violating the law namely anyone not depressed and alone.“This holiday season people could be out spreading cheer” Newsom told the press “a dangerous and illegal activity that we will crush. If we see any signs of this -- any smiles any singing anyone looking like they’re enjoying life at all -- they will be locked away for the protection of others.”So far door-to-door inspections have found most people in compliance doing completely legal pandemic activities like sitting alone in the dark staring at the wall lying face down on the floor and googling "how to tie a noose."  There are worries that some police may not try to enforce Newsom’s regulations for being “unconstitutional” and “evil” but so far everyone says they will go along. The Orange County Sheriff’s Department even has a special container labeled “Newsom’s Holiday Laws” though it does look suspiciously like a wastepaper basket.

While a number of reasons have been suggested to explain the increase the prevailing theory is that the messages are so unbelievably boring that churchgoers are forced to heavily caffeinate themselves just to make it through.Pastor Craig Bergman admitted the subject matter is a bit dry but said “It’s in there so I guess we better study it.”Even the most faithful of church members are finding it difficult to keep their eyes open during the sermons.“Normally I’m not much of a coffee drinker” said congregant Tom O’Shea. “And I almost never take it inside the worship center but desperate times call for desperate measures. It was either snore or sip. I chose to sip.”The coffee shop has seen a four-fold increase in sales overall and is now offering a "Leviticus Special" that includes three shots of espresso.“We’ve had dozens of people coming to get more during the sermon which almost never happens” said cafe volunteer Erin Subich. “One Sunday we ran out and some poor guy had to settle for tea. He didn’t make it.”Encouraged by the increased revenue Pastor Bergman is planning to do his next sermon series on the genealogies in First Chronicles.

Life has just been crazy in our little home!Ladies I want to take a moment to talk about vulnerability. In a world of Instagram influencers and Snapchat filters and immaculately photographed little Pinterest homes it can start to feel overwhelming. There’s so much pressure to keep up an image of perfection and quite frankly it can make me feel like I can barely breathe. Or it would if I didn’t do three hours of aerobics every day with my fitness coach Brad.That’s why I decided to do something different and new. I decided to post some photos to social media that reveal the less-than-perfect side of my life. So many people probably look at me as this incredible influencer with a perfect home adorable children perfect abs and an incredibly fit body. They’re right of course but that doesn’t mean I don’t have my moments.For example just the other day my housecleaner called in sick so my children’s toys were left in the living room for an extra thirty minutes before a backup housecleaner could be called. Rather than wait until I could show off a pristine photo I decided to just get real and share the following photo of the mess:I did this because we live in an imperfect messy world. And we shouldn’t be afraid to show that.I felt such relief after that post (and received so many new Likes and Follows) that I had an epiphany; what other messes and imperfections have I been afraid to show off? And how can I do that while also making sure people look up to me as a talented social media influencer/goddess?Simple. It turns out you can post the most perfectly flattering photos but everyone will still feel like you’re being vulnerable if you just say that you’re being vulnerable in the caption:Now before you allow insecurity to come in and tell you that you shouldn’t intentionally post things that borderline on narcissism... You just need to tell that voice to shut up. Because part of being vulnerable means admitting that it’s okay to take time for myself and admit that I really am amazing.

You know these no-good socialists are gonna socialize everything in sight. That's why we compiled these helpful tips to help you prepare for the coming socialist darkness! If you follow these 10 pointers you'll be great!Tip #1: Watch Sesame Street videos on sharingSharing is basically the same thing as socialism. The makers of Sesame Street know this well and have been quietly brainwashing kids to become socialists for decades. Spend a night binge-watching songs from Sesame Street and Daniel Tiger that encourage sharing and get yourself in the socialist spirit! Hey -- it's not so bad!Tip #2: Repent of your sin of capitalismWe all know Jesus was a socialist because he fed people and cared about the poor and stuff. You are just a lowly capitalist pig but he is ready to forgive you for your capitalism if you repent. For good measure grab yourself a cat o' nine tails and do some self-flagellation. That oughta do it.Tip #3: Emotionally distance yourself from your dogWe hate to break it to you but food is going to be a little scarce from now on. If you don't have a dog get one just in case. If you already have a dog start to emotionally distance yourself from that thing. Also stock up on cats.Tip #4 Get ready for universal healthcare by standing in line at the DMVAn important part of being a socialist is standing in lines like a good citizen. As a greedy capitalist used to instant gratification you'll need some practice. Get yourself a comfy pair of shoes and go practice standing in line for hours at the DMV. When you're ready for the next level stand in line at the county fair for a funnel cake and then don't buy one!Tip #5: Watch classic Obama speeches to get yourself pumped upIt's widely accepted that Obama is the most inspiring and uplifting speaker in all of human history. Watch his inspiring speeches over and over again to get yourself totally pumped up! If you're short on time just play a looped recording of Obama saying "that's not who we are" over and over again.Tip #6: Withdraw all your money in one-dollar bills so you'll have plenty of toilet paperLet's face it: money is an obsolete relic of capitalism and you don't need it anymore because The State will take care of you! Also due to hyperinflation all that filthy mammon is no longer worth the paper it's printed on. Your best bet is to hoard all that paper to use as toilet paper and fuel for fires during the winter. Your butt will thank you!Tip #7: Memorize your favorite booksBooks are full of forbidden knowledge that may endanger The State so you'll probably want to get rid of those. That said if you want to hang on to your favorite Harry Potter story for old time's sake you best memorize that thing.Tip #8: Fast at least 4 days a week to teach your body it doesn't really need foodFood is for weak capitalists. You're not a capitalist are you? Good socialists will never let themselves be tainted by delicious capitalist foods like bacon burgers and chimichangas. You're better than that comrade. Train your body to go without food as long as possible so that your government protectors may have the nourishment they need!Tip #9: Wean yourself off sleeping on a bedBeds are for colonizers. Indigenous people have slept on the ground for years and so can you bigot.Tip #10: Get rid of all religious books and imagery in your houseMake sure to rid yourself of anything that may divide your loyalty for your government is a jealous government. You must not let any real or imagined deities distract you. Get rid of all holy books hymnals and Chris Tomlin CDs. If however you were smart enough to purchase copies of The Sacred Texts of the Babylon Bee Volume 1 you should keep those. They double as body armor.You are ready comrade! Go and enjoy your glorious socialist future!

According to some members Flash seems to lag behind the worship team on the stage usually waiting several infuriating seconds into the next verse before he clicks the button to go to the next slide."Flash is so faithful and we appreciate his servant's heart" said CRRCC's worship leader Neo Panthadoop. "Seriously though -- our congregation hasn't sung the first line of a verse in weeks. We need to replace him but it would break his heart."According to sources Flash typically waits until the entire congregation is humming along and glancing back at him to see if he's awake before he clicks to the next slide. The church has tried giving him visual cues and even slipping extra espresso into his coffee in the morning but nothing seems to help. "I... am... so... happy... to... serve!" he said.The church is quietly looking for someone to take over as the new sound guy but they're having a really hard time since no one really knows how those soundboards even work or what sound guys really do.

And while the science is clear that schools are not a big risk for the spread of COVID-19 Democrats have expressed another fear over people going to school: children learning enough that they no longer trust the wisdom of government or believe in socialism.“People keep talking to me like I’m dumb and I don’t know what I’m doing” said New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. “It’s because when people learn things they think they know better than me -- me the governor -- so no more schools. I’m shutting them down.”The move has been praised by other Democrats such as Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. “Whenever I talk about my plans to give people lots of free stuff people always bring up math” Ocasio-Cortez complained. “I don’t know what that is but apparently it’s some crazy right-wing thing you learn at schools that makes you not like socialism. Maybe people should just stay away from schools.” Ocasio-Cortez also pointed out that schooling is unnecessary for the future occupation of staying home while the government sends you checks.As for teachers' unions their position is that schools can stay closed forever as long as they all still get paid. Still there is concern that people may try to learn on their own which is why Democrats are also asking for the help of Big Tech to block queries against their policies and to put a “this is disputed” label on anything questioning Democratic politicians.

From religious weirdos to dummies who don't think the public school system is teaching us English very good parents are flocking to homeschooling in droves.But you don't have to sit idly by while kids in your neighborhood suffer. You can be on the lookout for kids who are homeschooled so you can be sure their weirdness doesn't rub off on your kiddos. Here are ten easy-to-recognize warning signs that someone in your community is homeschooled:1. They can do simple math problems in their head. This is an obvious one but if they don't have to take their shoes off to do 5x6 or 9+2 they're probably homeschooled.2. They read books. Also they know what a book is.3. They use big words and phrases like "Hello" and "Greetings good sir what a jolly fine day it is." This one's a toss-up: they're either homeschooled or British. If they have a pipe and monocle they're probably just British.4. They snort in derision whenever they hear the phrase "Millions of years ago..." Eye-rolling also occurs from time to time or they respond with "Well actually..."5. They count all the way to 10 during hide-and-seek. Public school kids often start mumbling around six or seven which are toughies.6. They put "science" in air quotes. Whenever they talk about "science" look for the tell-tale air quotes and mocking tone.7. They think "Fortnite" is a reference to a two-week period of time. As it should be.8. On the girls the floor-length denim skirts are a dead giveaway. If it's a boy wearing a denim skirt then he's definitely a public-schooler.9. When they hear "Homer" they think "Iliad" rather than "Simpson." To be honest they're not even sure what The Simpsons is.10. They are polite thoughtful and well-adjusted. This is a sure sign of a homeschooled kid. Dangerous and terrifying.Remember if you see something say something.

Greenland where Trump will establish a colony that's "even bigger and better than that old stupid America.""It will be the best America maybe ever!" he said as the crowd cheered. "We're talking freedom you wouldn't believe liberties galore. That old sad America is just pathetic! Not good!"The ships then pulled out of the harbor as Antifa well-wishers stood and screamed at the sky distraught that their only reason for living was leaving America.Plans for the new colony include a Mt. Rushmore that just has four faces of Trump a Statue of Liberty modeled after Melania and a Meme War Memorial in the capital city of Trumpington. Greenland will be divided into the same states we have in America today though California and New York will be left out in order to make it a true utopia.

Now they owe an even greater debt to society as I’ve doubled the debt they spent learning how to be evil and dumb.”This move is expected to hit journalism schools especially hard as journalism was already a fairly useless major and now it will cost twice as much. The executive order also promises to be a big blow to journalists themselves as they don’t make a lot of money since a lot of people do their job for free online.When told that many journalists may not be able to afford the increased debt Trump unveiled a new plan to make a special debtors' prison just for journalists.This executive order has already affected many journalists facing the prospect of increased debt. For instance Brian Stelter in addition to watching FOX News and telling people on CNN what he saw on FOX News is now also working a night shift at Taco John’s.

How do they not see that we are the good guys?”It was at that moment Asher knew he had to go to the Proud Boys and learn their secrets. So he took off his face mask and walked over to their tent to get answers.“Yeah don’t get us wrong we are a lot of things like violent dangerously nationalistic and obnoxious but it’s probably how we just don’t judge people by skin color” said Proud Boy member Lars Macon. “Also have you tried letting other people speak instead of speaking for them?”“But how else will they know what to be offended by and how to stop it unless I tell them?” Asher replied.  “This doesn’t make sense. I knew I should have never tried talking to you Neo-Nazis!”He then stormed off and went back and told the other Antifa members that the Proud Boys were obviously keeping those African American members there against their will.

One local plumbing contractor Sam Caughorn is really looking forward to paying the tab on his neighbor's $89000 gender studies degree."Listen I'm just a plumber" he said.

According to the charge Ananias and Sapphira allegedly sold a piece of property in order to give the proceeds to the church but deceitfully kept some of the money for themselves. The charge comes from the Apostle Peter.“When this comes to light it isn’t gonna be pretty” said Peter. “They could have used the land or the money however they felt the Spirit leading them to. We weren’t requiring them to give the money to us but for some reason they lied about it and said they did.

I’m not saying we did anything wrong but even if we did what difference does it make? We got the result we wanted right?”Peter’s claim that the fraud was a conspiracy fueled by Satan himself has many in the church wondering about the veracity of Ananias and Sapphira’s claim of innocence.Despite multiple attempts the couple could not be reached for additional comments.

That’s just how it works in space.”Trump has denounced what he calls a “perversion” of his Space Force which he says was built for the peaceful mission of seeking out new life and new civilizations and building Trump towers there.

"There's no such thing as evolution. This is obviously just a gross mutation. I mean look at this kid. That's the ugliest thing I've ever seen."Jared's mom however had other feelings."All this time I thought God created the universe in six days. But now now I understand what they were trying to teach me at public school. Humans came from monkeys and monkeys came from trees. We adapted to our environment and now my little Jared has adapted to his: the strange new world we live in where everyone has to wear a mask until they die."After further investigation doctors discovered a few more mutations in little Jared Zimmerman. The newborn had self-washing hands which washed themselves every ten minutes; the little guy was also born with a bottle of Lysol attached to his hip; and most impressive of all the newborn emitted a strong magnetic force which kept anyone from outside of his household six feet away from him at all times.It’s now completely obvious: evolution is real.

The controllers have lots of buttons.In short it's fine.So we hate to rain on everyone's parade but we have to ask the question here: can anything really be fine under Trump?Take the resolution for instance: the PS5 has native 4K support. But when we look at the number "4" all we can think about is how Trump has ruined democracy for the past 4 years. Every crystal-clear pixel is a painful reminder of every life Trump has destroyed.We want to enjoy the system's silky-smooth 120 frames per second. But that many children per second are put in cages under the Trump administration. So all we can think about when we are enjoying the incredible lightning-quick frame rate is Trump.We tried to escape reality by swinging around New York in the new Spider-Man game but all we see is the empty nursing homes throughout the city: empty because Trump murdered the senior citizens within. Again somehow we find ourselves thinking about Trump which just goes to show how deranged he is.Even the name "PlayStation" implies that it's OK to play when we live under a fascist regime. "ProtestStation" or "RiotStation" or "ScreamStation" would have been far more appropriate and it seems a little tone-deaf of Sony to not read the room here.In the end we put the PS5 back in the box and screamed at the sky in rage. That was really cathartic. Because of this incredible experience we award the PS5 our coveted highest score:FIVE SCREAMS OUT OF FIVE

Many on the left though condemned the ritual mass suicide as “cultural appropriation.”“I guess that’s it” said The Babylon Bee CEO Seth Dillion sipping a Mojito as he sat by the pool at his mansion built with satire money. “I bought The Babylon Bee for one purpose: to help elect Republicans. But it couldn’t even help reelect the greatest president ever. Now there is nothing left. I guess I might as well do the honorable thing and join my staff in committing seppuku too.” He took another sip of his drink. “Eh I’ll get to it tomorrow.”

So far Trump has refused to concede the election and some are taking that book as a sign that Trump is planning something if the election isn’t certified in his favor.The book Trump was reading is a helpful step-by-step guide to gaining the favor of the military and using them to overthrow the current government using illustrations and comics to emphasize a few key points in organizing a successful coup. It’s not one of the most successful books in the For Dummies series and sells much better overseas.White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany was quick to dismiss any concerns about it. “There is no need for Trump to organize a military coup” McEnany told the press. “He won the election fair and square and a count of all the legal votes will show that.”Still reporters pressed McEnany on why Trump would read such a book if he is not planning a coup. “He’s just a very curious person who reads a lot of different things but it doesn’t mean he’s planning anything” McEnany answered. “I mean you saw him reading Harry Potter but he didn’t try to become a wizard.” McEnany did admit that Trump had attempted afterward to make a Horcrux though that “didn’t work out.”Many are still speculating on how successful a military coup would be if Trump tried to lead one. Currently the branch of the military most loyal to him is Space Force but there is very little government to coup in space.
'November 11th 2020',https://babylonbee.com/news/new-bible-features-removable-romans-13-for-when-you-dont-like-the-president,"New Bible Features Removable Romans 13 For When You Don't Like The President",NEW YORK NY—Zondervan Bibles has just announced the release of the NIV Partisan Bible an innovative new Bible design featuring a fully removable portion of Romans 13 for when you really don’t like the new President of the United States of America.According to Zondervan’s press release Romans 13:1-7 will easily separate and lift right out of the pages of Scripture using their patented Pick-and-Lift® technology handy for when you don't like the president. The reader can then study and meditate upon Romans 12 and immediately take their devotions right to Romans 13:8 without skipping a beat. You can store the passage in a handy pouch right on the back of the Bible so you can put it back in when a guy you like gets elected.In addition to the removable Romans 13 which seems to clearly and unequivocally state that Christians are to obey the sword-bearing governing authorities that have been sent by God to punish evil and reward good the NIV Partisan Bible will allow the reader to excise similar sections of the New Testament like those found in 1 Peter 2:13-17 which tells believers to “submit to every human authority whether to the emperor as the supreme authority or to governors as sent by him."Another verse Zondervan took care of in the NIV Partisan Bible was Titus 3:1. They had to get creative since the verse in Titus is brief so they came up with a nifty pull-tab like you see in many children’s board books that will completely and neatly cover the statement “Remind the people to be subject to rulers and authorities to be obedient to be ready to do whatever is good” and let you be on your way through the rest of Titus.“Submit to an emperor like Nero?” sneered one Bible reviewer as he demonstrated in a review video how you can rip out that portion of 1 Peter 2 and still neatly preserve the immediate text around it in the NIV Partisan Bible. “That doesn’t sound very American. I for one will not bow down to Sleepy Joe or Comrade Harris!”With the timing of this release Zondervan believes this new Bible will be immediately popular with one down-and-out group of Christians but if they wait 4 more years it will soon be in every house in America.

Researchers found that when people get everything they want politically they are three times more likely to call for unity and reconciliation with the losers they just humiliated."It was an extensive study of thousands of 3-year-olds and other liberals that led to us discovering this connection" said Dr. Stan Lintel of MIT who headed the study. "We would observe a pair of children fighting over a toy. We would then step in and take the toy away from one child and give it to the other. The child we gave the toy to would immediately calm down and call for unity with the other child even after punching them in the face several times. We found this tendency remained consistent all the way into adulthood."Researchers who released the findings pointed out that this strange human behavior could be manifesting itself during this year's election after Democrats immediately calmed down and called for unity after an intense 4-year temper tantrum.

Additionally they were unable to protect Obama’s legacy from the Hail Mary play that was Donald Trump.“We just have to get in there and block block block” said veteran defensive player Dave Weigel. “Biden and the Democrats are going to make mistakes every day and the job of journalists is going to be to crush any of those stories before they get going. It’s a whole different ball game from round-the-clock coverage of every Trump tweet but we’re ready.”

"Joe is suuuch a healthy guy and we had no idea this sudden blast of flashing lights and deafening sound would have any negative effects on his health! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"According to sources Biden is recovering nicely after emergency heart surgery and is expected to remember who he is by the end of the week."He's still alive?" Kamala said after receiving the news. "Oh...that's that's wonderful! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"Harris and the rest of the staff are hoping to make things up to Biden. They have already crafted an apology cake and hidden Pete Buttigieg inside so he can burst out of the cake at the last minute.

"Just like every other Sunday Christians gathered to pray sing praises and fellowship with each other but with Trump out of the picture we have no idea who they could possibly be worshipping or celebrating.

Several rumors have emerged that they have replaced their Trump deity with a 2000-year-old Jewish Rabbi. "These rumors can't be true since Trump supporters are anti-semites" Andross explained.Other rumors have suggested that Christians are still worshipping Trump based on the claim that he will someday rise again. "This seems the most likely scenario" explains Andross.According to several witnesses Christians across the country seem happy peaceful and very much in love with whatever deity they are worshipping which is "impossible considering the circumstances" according to experts."I need to do more research on this" said Vorlap Andross.

I just don't know what I would do with myself for the next four years if he were to suddenly be out of my life."

"It was cruel and inconsiderate of them to make our pollsters look this bad by voting differently than all our very smart pollsters thought they would."Nancy Pelosi also shared outrage at the American people for defying the pollsters and has promised to introduce legislation requiring voters to obey the pollsters during the next election.At the time of publication pollsters are now enthusiastically predicting a 1000-year Democrat reign.

A close study has found that Democratic ads would have been much more effective if they had called Hispanics by the names they actually identify as such as "Latino" "Hispanic" or even their nationality or country of origin."Latinx? What's that?" said one Cuban man in Miami as he saw a Biden bus ad reading "Hola Latinx! Biden es Bueno!""Latinx? Weird. I guess that ad isn't targeted at me" he thought to himself. He then looked down at his smartphone. "Oh hey look a funny video of Trump dancing. Classic!"Analysts are also absolutely flummoxed that Biden playing Despacito on his smartphone did very little to move the Hispanic vote in his direction.

"We must build a wall to keep these Hispanics out because they are a threat to our democracy now that they no longer can be counted on to vote Democrat every time. We think a big giant wall is just the thing to prevent these future Republican voters from coming to our country."She was asked if a border wall is still racist and xenophobic and replied "We have to build it to find out if it's racist."“It’s just so scary to see so many Hispanics voting Republican” said Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. “I mean I’m Hispanic so that means there’s an increased chance of me being a Republican.” Ocasio-Cortez then gasped and clutched her face. “I could start hating my socialism!”Democrats also say they will stop calling Hispanics “Latinx” as they no longer deserve that very special term they made for them.

So to protest the awfulness of both he refused to vote for either of them and instead filled out his mail-in ballot for Libertarian Party candidate Jo Jorgensen. But being a practical man and not wanting to waste postage or a mail carrier’s time he then placed the completed ballot straight into his kitchen garbage.“It felt good to accomplish this extremely pointless act and tell the two major parties I’m not beholden to them” Stone said. “The idea that we only have a binary choice is what’s holding this country back. It’s also the reason why I’m not going to pretend voting for a third-party candidate actually does anything.”Stone realized there were also a number of down-ballot races to vote on but like most people he doesn’t pay much attention to local politics. Stone spent the rest of the day trying to find an “I Voted” sticker in one of his neighbors' trash cans.
