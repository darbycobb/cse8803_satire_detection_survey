Plus, as the twins' mother, I drew the short straw and got breastfeeding duty! These babies are keeping me up all hours of the night to breastfeed!"Buttigieg also cited his need for extended bed rest following a difficult labor. "It really did a number on me," he said. "I'm still so tired and hormonal, and those varicose veins and stretch marks! So many stretch marks!"Sources later confirmed the varicose veins and stretch marks were unrelated to the new babies. The Buttigieg's confirmed they are supplementing with infant formula since breastfeeding has proven difficult. "We thought there might have been a problem when the babies started losing a ton of weight. Thankfully, our house servant María told us about baby formula which really helps!"Buttigieg has suggested in the meantime that port authorities employ the help of Theodore Tugboat and get some bigger choo-choo trains to help clear the supply chain backlog.

Now, instead of Kryptonite, he will be rendered completely powerless by anyone who addresses him using the wrong pronouns. "I'll finally defeat Superman! He's such a liberal snowflake!" says right-wing transphobe Lex Luthor to reporters in the latest issue."NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!" cries gay Superman in response as he withers to the ground in shrieks of agony. "I'm non-binary! It should be 'THEY is such a snowflake!' EEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!" Writers confirmed that gay Superman will gay-save the world and gay-stop hate crimes with his gay superpowers. He will be completely impervious to Kryptonite but will be powerless against right-wing talk show hosts and trans-exclusionary radical feminist authors. First and foremost, he will be very, very gay. "We are so proud to break new ground with this stunning, brave, totally expected, and culturally fashionable change to the Superman character," said writer Tom Taylor. "We look forward to selling dozens and dozens of copies."

He stopped by the deodorant aisle and smiled. "Not a single stick of deodorant to choose from. My work here is done.""I'm glad I can finally turn in my Senator's badge and gun, resting easy in the knowledge that the United States is in good hands. We'll be eating dogs before you know it."Sanders says he now takes a refreshing morning walk through the grocery store every morning, taking deep breaths as he admires the empty bread shelves, reminding him of the halcyon days. "We've gotta keep Biden in office so it can be like this all the time."

But this is even more amazing, as the justice pointed out that Epstein was likely murdered."I wanted to make sure Justice Ginsburg was not spreading false information like that," Couric said in defense of her deceptive editing practices. "It would have reflected badly on her and made people think she couldn't do her job. Everyone knows that Epstein killed himself and that's that. Absolutely nothing shady happened there.""Also, for the record, I do not have any dirt on Hillary Clinton and am in fine mental health."According to the full transcript of the interview, Ginsburg said, "You know, it just doesn't add up. The jail cell tape went missing, the guards had some shifty stuff going on. I bet Epstein had dirt on a lot of people that would want him dead. I'm gonna go on the record here and say that Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself."Ginsburg reportedly went on to say other controversial statements that Couric edited out, such as "F--- Joe Biden", "Taxation is theft", and "Make America great again."

They take for granted the fact that they can just pop over to the store on the way home from work on Christmas Eve and grab a bunch of stuff, hoping it appeases their wife. But no longer, experts say."We're advising all men to start their Christmas shopping sometime before late December this year," said one economist. "You might not be able to frantically run into a big-box store an hour before closing on Christmas Eve and just throw stuff in your cart willy-nilly, because, well, there may not be anything left.""You won't be able to count on there being shelves and shelves full of candles, lotions, and gift cards you don't even know if she would like you can grab at random this year."In response to the urging of officials, the nation's husbands have begrudgingly agreed to begin shopping on December 23.

One by one, they came to, with hazy memories of a van pulling up and nabbing them off the streets."Welcome, welcome!" a cheery voice greeted them. Emerging from the shadows was none other than billionaire Jeff Bezos. "Shall we play a game?" Bezos informed the hapless pawns in his game that they would compete in a series of children's activities, such as red light, green light, hopscotch, and a creation of his own called "Smear the Elon."During the first game, terrified contestants learned the hard way that those who lose the games are immediately gunned down. "But wait!" Bezos said as they demanded he let them go. "I haven't revealed the prize yet!" He pressed a button to lower a large piggy bank from the ceiling containing one ticket for the next Blue Origin flight, but accidentally pressed the trapdoor button, sending himself plummeting into the alligator pit. "Why do I even have that button?" he muttered to himself as he kicked a gator off his foot.Amazon has confirmed that participation in the next series of games will be mandatory for all Americans.

"This is rare air you're breathing," said Chris Tomlin at the time, congratulating Kevin on his incredible success. "Your future is good, good good, good good good good good. It's what it is."The praise band had been hard at work figuring out how to make the bridge for 'Oceans' last until Deacon Bob's heart failure won out when Kevin was struck with an idea. "What if, what if what if what if...I played a different chord as like, as like as like as like, a transition, and then went back to the bridge?"The rhythm guitar player scratched the shock of hair coming out from his toboggan, wondering aloud if this was heresy. The bass player said nothing, being a phantom of everyone's imagination. The drummer said something profound, but it was muffled by his cage. The female vocalist just looked at him longingly, wondering if he had noticed her yet for her beautiful, inaudible harmonizing. Kevin decided to go for it.Immediately, the roof shattered, the clouds parted, and angels came to bring Kevin into eternal glory. "This is my praise band leader, in whom I am well pleased," boomed a voice from on high. "There were just no praise songs left for Kevin down here on Earth," said Pastor Terry Stegall of Church On The Rock. "I always said that kid could stretch a song bridge into eternity. I guess he finally did."

In the upcoming series of comics, Superman Jr. will settle down with his partner in Greenwich Village in Metropolis, adopt some cats, and go antiquing on weekends. "The cool thing about gay Superman's weekend shopping trips is he'll be able to use his super-hearing to scout out all the best deals on antiques for his quaint little apartment," said writer Tom Taylor. "So that will be kinda cool. Then he can, like, fly there real quick and snag the bargain antique before anyone else. Did we mention he'll have some cats? I don't think there have been pet cats in a Superman comic before, so yeah, that's pretty neat. We hope this makes us relevant again so you'll buy our comics."Sources say the legendary superhero will have a new backstory, having escaped from Krypton after homophobic aliens destroyed it due to all the gayness that was there. He will then fly to earth to fight bigots."Our new villain Mike Von Pence will be the most fearsome villain we've written to date," said Taylor. "Gay Superman Jr. will thwart his evil master plan to hook everyone up to electroshock therapy and turn Metropolis into the Handmaid's Tale."According to sources, gay Superman will also team up with another new spin on a classic character: straight Aquaman.

The pop-up Halloween stores showed up overnight, hanging banners along bread aisles, toilet paper aisles, meat aisles, and shelves previously home to all kinds of other basic necessities.The costume and party supply store will sell its wares at tiny little stores all along the shelves. Shoppers who are unable to acquire bread and milk will be able to treat themselves to tiny little costumes and Halloween accessories. "Please be aware that none of our products are edible," said CEO David S. Pumpkins. "In fact, they probably contain lead paint and stuff since they're from China. So if you're starving we can't help you, but we hope we can at least brighten your day with a little Halloween cheer!"Sources did confirm that for especially desperate people, the rubber Freddy Krueger masks are somewhat edible if you boil them long enough. Unfortunately, the Spirit Halloween shelves remained bare since their entire stock is still sitting on a stranded cargo ship outside Long Beach.

This time, they’re threatening to release an extremely politically incorrect comedy special.“No topic will be taboo,” said the founder of Al-Qaeda, Bob Al-Qaeda. “LGBTQ issues — trans issues specifically — racial issues — you will be screaming at the screen, ‘No! Don’t go there!’ But we swear by Allah we will go there.”The threat was met with immediate panic in the U.S. “These insensitive jokes could literally get people killed!” screamed one left-wing activist. “We have to stop this! Shut down the internet if we must! And give in to all their demands!” President Biden said he was giving in to their demands as he was “pulling out of Afghanistan as fast as he can” but he’s not sure it will be enough to stop the terrorist word-violence.It’s unknown how the comedy special will be released. It’s possible it will come out on Netflix. “We did release Cuties,” said Netflix CEO and founder, Bob Netflix. “So it would be pretty hypocritical to draw the line at Al-Qaeda.”The Department of Homeland Security is calling on everyone to be vigilant and to report the sound of laughter since proper, sensitive, progressive humor should never evoke any other sound than clapping.There are concerns, however, that the Al-Qaeda comedian will bomb.
'October 14th 2021',https://babylonbee.com/news/boy-who-pointed-out-the-emperor-has-no-clothes-banned-for-misinformation,"Boy Who Pointed Out The Emperor Has No Clothes Banned For Misinformation",U.S.—Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram have all confirmed they have banned a young peasant child from their social networks after he pointed out that the emperor has no clothes.The brouhaha started after God-Emperor Joseph I showed off his new wardrobe at a press conference this morning. The press reported his fashion was "impeccable" and that he looked like an "even hotter George Clooney," but some far-right extremists said that he was actually naked."Is it just me, or is the emperor not wearing any clothes?" the boy posted on his social media accounts Thursday. Censors worked quickly, flagging his tweet with a warning that it was potentially harmful misinformation. Snopes fact-checked his claim and found that it was "mostly false," as the emperor was wearing socks. CNN dug into his old tweets and found that he tweeted that his best friend Castellan was a "booger head" two years ago.He made his case for the emperor actually being completely naked on his Parler account, prompting Amazon to immediately take down all of Parler. The IRS is also looking into his accounts as he had over 600 copper pieces in his satchel, and the FBI is going after him as he had a castle Lego set at his home, causing some to wonder if he was going to attack the emperor's castle and cause an insurrection.Meanwhile, the emperor, who is very old and mostly stays in the castle dungeon eating ice cream, had his spokesperson, Lady Jen Flocky, address the controversy. "Hear ye! Hear ye! The emperor is wearing the finest clothes, I assure you all," she said. "By his majesty's royal decree, anyone who says otherwise will be thrown into the alligator pit!"

"Sporadically running upstairs, and then downstairs, and then upstairs again to keep my humans awake is exhausting," Autumn told reporters, yawning, as she woke up from her seventh nap of the day. "It's not an easy job, but someone has to do it. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go meow by my food dish so my humans can move the food around and make it look like there's more food in there than there is." The cat says she is planning on some new moves today, including a few parkour tricks like jumping off the walls and kicking over a laundry basket and then fleeing through the house like a bat out of heck. Autumn has also filed a complaint of animal abuse against her owners for only holding the door open for her for seven hours at a time while she decides if she wants to go outside or stay inside.

"We here on the high seas often sing our sea shanties in his honor and pour out rum for such a swell guy.""SQUAWK! SUCH A SWELL GUY!" the parrot on his shoulder repeated.The captain said he and the other ship captains wanted to spell out a different phrase, but it was rated "ARRRRR".Experts who know what they're talking about say the catastrophic background has nothing to do with labor shortages due to vaccine mandates, or any policy related to President Biden and his highly competent Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg."Hey wow! Look at all those really big boats!" said Buttigieg while visiting the port. "Boats go vroooom! Pretty colors! I like the blue one!" He then went back home to play some Ticket to Ride and Mario Kart to help educate himself on more transportation-related issues.Longshoremen predict they will have the backlog fixed by 2028.

But soon after, the whole land became overrun with bothersome giant flies.“This is why I hate adventurers,” said the unnamed man who runs the inn in the nearby town of Wolfwater. “They just see some ‘monsters’ and say, ‘Hey, maybe if I kill that, I’ll get some good experience, and perhaps it will drop some gold.’ And they never think of the long-term consequences.”“The giant ecosystem — though giant — is very fragile,” explained Professor Fizzle, who works in the library in Wolfwater. “Why do you think dungeons are overrun with giant rats? Because long ago, people killed all the giant cats.”Stormbreaker, one of the adventurers who was carrying an improbable sword nearly his own size, was unapologetic. “Those spiders attacked us when we were wandering the forest in search of the entrance to the Cave of Shadows,” he explained. “What was I supposed to do? Scoop them up in a giant cup?”It is unknown now whether the citizens of Wolfwater will need to import spiders from a neighboring region to restore balance to the ecosystem, or if the spiders will respawn if they just wait long enough.

The guy who took a knee before it was cool? Well, Tebow is now officially the only member of the NFL. The bold change for the league occurred after officials decided that everyone who had ever said a bad word would be removed from the league.The entire NFL will just be an empty field with Tebow tossing a ball to himself with no spectators, coaches, teammates, opponents, or commentators, sources at the league confirmed today."Welp, I guess it's just Tim out there now," said Roger Goodell in his resignation speech. "I hope everyone enjoys watching him play. Well, I mean, you can't actually watch him because we've fired you as a fan for saying something off-color once. But Tim is a good kid. He'll have fun out there."Tebow took to the field for his first NFL game as the only member of the league Thursday evening, quietly took a knee and said a prayer, and then just went out there and tossed the ball around to himself. "I just want to thank my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ for blessing me with this opportunity," Tebow said. "And I want to thank the rest of the league for being heathens who said bad words in the past. I owe it all to you guys."Tebow still didn't score any touchdowns.

They then proceeded to thoroughly catalog all the excess income collected by the new seven-year-old.Chief Airborne Auditor Alvin “Deduction Strangler” Clarke reviewed the agents’ findings. “Cash payments in the birthday cards alone easily approach the $600 threshold, even though Papa Earl and Gigi clearly tried to cheap out with a $15 McDonald’s gift card.”Clarke continued, “We also had a trampoline, several Barbies, and a few Lego sets, although we didn’t find the Millenium Falcon that Agent Glenn was really hoping to find for his kids. I mean for the evidence in the case. That’s right. A lot of the time I refer to evidence as ‘Agent Glenn’s kids.’ Why wouldn’t I?”Sally Smithson spent the rest of the day filling out complicated tax forms while the surrounding agents ate her cake and ice cream. “This is an important lesson for a young American to learn,” said Agent Clarke. “Remember, Sally, always check with the government before you do anything. And don’t forget to check that box about donating $1 to the presidential campaign fund. Support democracy!”
'October 14th 2021',https://babylonbee.com/news/dc-introduces-straight-christian-robin,"For Sake Of Diversity, DC Introduces Straight Christian Robin",BURBANK, CA—DC Comics recently announced on National Coming Out Day that the next iteration of Batman's faithful sidekick and boy wonder Robin will be coming out as a straight, cis-male fundamentalist Christian."We always knew Robin was gay," said writer Tom Taylor. "In fact, it's apparent that pretty much every DC superhero ever written has always been super gay. We thought it was time for a meaningful change to the Batman universe."To introduce some diversity to the almost 100% gay characters of DC, Robin will be rewritten as a faithful Baptist deacon from Indiana, who has a loving wife and 5 kids, and who fights crime in his spare time. He will also patrol universities to own the libs and shut down atheists. "Robin the Christian Boy Wonder will roam the streets of Gotham with his gay mentor Batman, sharing the good news of Jesus with street thugs and Arkham inmates," Taylor explained. "He is passionately pro-life, and even protests outside the abortion clinic from time to time. He'll also have some great catchphrases like 'Holy... is the Lord God Almighty, the whole earth is filled with his glory, Batman!' We've never had a character like this before."DC said they will be continuing to push inclusion in their comics by introducing some weak female characters to bring some more diversity to their lineup of strong female characters. 
'October 13th 2021',https://babylonbee.com/news/breaking-evil-mirror-universe-william-shatner-returns-from-space,"Breaking: Evil Mirror Universe William Shatner Returns From Space",On Wednesday, William Shatner, the beloved Boston Legal actor famous for portraying attorney Denny Crane, traveled to space.Shatner was one of four people aboard Jeff Bezos’s cucumber-shaped Blue Origin rocket as it soared to the edge of the atmosphere, offering breathtaking views and a few minutes of weightlessness. The shaft of the eggplant-shaped craft then detached and passengers floated back to earth. The mission seemed to be a success, but concerned witnesses said something about Shatner seemed off."He seemed…evil," said another crew member. "And he had a black goatee that really added to his evil look."After attempting to sabotage the next flight by removing the inertial dampeners and randomly attacking a civilian in a red shirt, Shatner declared that West Texas, where he landed, was “now part of the Terran Empire.” When Bezos attempted to congratulate him on his journey, Shatner cracked a bunch of bald jokes and mocked Bezos for being only the second richest person in the world.Experts theorize that somewhere in the lower atmosphere, the mushroom-shaped vessel encountered a disruption in the space/time continuum, and the William Shatner from our reality was replaced by a sinister William Shatner from a parallel timeline. Worst of all, the mirror Shatner is almost indistinguishable from our William Shatner, save his striking goatee and big, thick, evil eyebrows.Thankfully, the threat posed by evil William Shatner is predicted to be short-lived since, like the real William Shatner, he is 90 years old. Due to his age, he will probably return to the heavens soon, and this time not in a bratwurst-shaped spacecraft.

Plus, as the twins' mother, I drew the short straw and got breastfeeding duty! These babies are keeping me up all hours of the night to breastfeed!"Buttigieg also cited his need for extended bed rest following a difficult labor. "It really did a number on me," he said. "I'm still so tired and hormonal, and those varicose veins and stretch marks! So many stretch marks!"Sources later confirmed the varicose veins and stretch marks were unrelated to the new babies. The Buttigieg's confirmed they are supplementing with infant formula since breastfeeding has proven difficult. "We thought there might have been a problem when the babies started losing a ton of weight. Thankfully, our house servant María told us about baby formula which really helps!"Buttigieg has suggested in the meantime that port authorities employ the help of Theodore Tugboat and get some bigger choo-choo trains to help clear the supply chain backlog.

He will be completely impervious to Kryptonite but will be powerless against right-wing talk show hosts and trans-exclusionary radical feminist authors. First and foremost, he will be very, very gay. "We are so proud to break new ground with this stunning, brave, totally expected, and culturally fashionable change to the Superman character," said writer Tom Taylor.

But this is even more amazing, as the justice pointed out that Epstein was likely murdered."I wanted to make sure Justice Ginsburg was not spreading false information like that," Couric said in defense of her deceptive editing practices. "It would have reflected badly on her and made people think she couldn't do her job. Everyone knows that Epstein killed himself and that's that. Absolutely nothing shady happened there.""Also, for the record, I do not have any dirt on Hillary Clinton and am in fine mental health."According to the full transcript of the interview, Ginsburg said, "You know, it just doesn't add up. The jail cell tape went missing, the guards had some shifty stuff going on. I bet Epstein had dirt on a lot of people that would want him dead. I'm gonna go on the record here and say that Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself."Ginsburg reportedly went on to say other controversial statements that Couric edited out, such as "F--- Joe Biden", "Taxation is theft", and "Make America great again."

Emerging from the shadows was none other than billionaire Jeff Bezos. "Shall we play a game?" Bezos informed the hapless pawns in his game that they would compete in a series of children's activities, such as red light, green light, hopscotch, and a creation of his own called "Smear the Elon."During the first game, terrified contestants learned the hard way that those who lose the games are immediately gunned down. "But wait!" Bezos said as they demanded he let them go. "I haven't revealed the prize yet!" He pressed a button to lower a large piggy bank from the ceiling containing one ticket for the next Blue Origin flight, but accidentally pressed the trapdoor button, sending himself plummeting into the alligator pit. "Why do I even have that button?" he muttered to himself as he kicked a gator off his foot.Amazon has confirmed that participation in the next series of games will be mandatory for all Americans.

"This is rare air you're breathing," said Chris Tomlin at the time, congratulating Kevin on his incredible success. "Your future is good, good good, good good good good good. It's what it is."The praise band had been hard at work figuring out how to make the bridge for 'Oceans' last until Deacon Bob's heart failure won out when Kevin was struck with an idea. "What if, what if what if what if...I played a different chord as like, as like as like as like, a transition, and then went back to the bridge?"The rhythm guitar player scratched the shock of hair coming out from his toboggan, wondering aloud if this was heresy. The bass player said nothing, being a phantom of everyone's imagination. The drummer said something profound, but it was muffled by his cage. The female vocalist just looked at him longingly, wondering if he had noticed her yet for her beautiful, inaudible harmonizing. Kevin decided to go for it.Immediately, the roof shattered, the clouds parted, and angels came to bring Kevin into eternal glory. "This is my praise band leader, in whom I am well pleased," boomed a voice from on high. "There were just no praise songs left for Kevin down here on Earth," said Pastor Terry Stegall of Church On The Rock.

This time, they’re threatening to release an extremely politically incorrect comedy special.“No topic will be taboo,” said the founder of Al-Qaeda, Bob Al-Qaeda. “LGBTQ issues — trans issues specifically — racial issues — you will be screaming at the screen, ‘No! Don’t go there!’ But we swear by Allah we will go there.”The threat was met with immediate panic in the U.S. “These insensitive jokes could literally get people killed!” screamed one left-wing activist. “We have to stop this! Shut down the internet if we must! And give in to all their demands!” President Biden said he was giving in to their demands as he was “pulling out of Afghanistan as fast as he can” but he’s not sure it will be enough to stop the terrorist word-violence.It’s unknown how the comedy special will be released. It’s possible it will come out on Netflix. “We did release Cuties,” said Netflix CEO and founder, Bob Netflix. “So it would be pretty hypocritical to draw the line at Al-Qaeda.”The Department of Homeland Security is calling on everyone to be vigilant and to report the sound of laughter since proper, sensitive, progressive humor should never evoke any other sound than clapping.There are concerns, however, that the Al-Qaeda comedian will bomb.

The press reported his fashion was "impeccable" and that he looked like an "even hotter George Clooney," but some far-right extremists said that he was actually naked."Is it just me, or is the emperor not wearing any clothes?" the boy posted on his social media accounts Thursday. Censors worked quickly, flagging his tweet with a warning that it was potentially harmful misinformation. Snopes fact-checked his claim and found that it was "mostly false," as the emperor was wearing socks. CNN dug into his old tweets and found that he tweeted that his best friend Castellan was a "booger head" two years ago.He made his case for the emperor actually being completely naked on his Parler account, prompting Amazon to immediately take down all of Parler. The IRS is also looking into his accounts as he had over 600 copper pieces in his satchel, and the FBI is going after him as he had a castle Lego set at his home, causing some to wonder if he was going to attack the emperor's castle and cause an insurrection.Meanwhile, the emperor, who is very old and mostly stays in the castle dungeon eating ice cream, had his spokesperson, Lady Jen Flocky, address the controversy. "Hear ye! Hear ye! The emperor is wearing the finest clothes, I assure you all," she said. "By his majesty's royal decree, anyone who says otherwise will be thrown into the alligator pit!"

The cat says she is planning on some new moves today, including a few parkour tricks like jumping off the walls and kicking over a laundry basket and then fleeing through the house like a bat out of heck. Autumn has also filed a complaint of animal abuse against her owners for only holding the door open for her for seven hours at a time while she decides if she wants to go outside or stay inside.

Because long ago, people killed all the giant cats.”Stormbreaker, one of the adventurers who was carrying an improbable sword nearly his own size, was unapologetic. “Those spiders attacked us when we were wandering the forest in search of the entrance to the Cave of Shadows,” he explained. “What was I supposed to do? Scoop them up in a giant cup?”It is unknown now whether the citizens of Wolfwater will need to import spiders from a neighboring region to restore balance to the ecosystem, or if the spiders will respawn if they just wait long enough.

"And I want to thank the rest of the league for being heathens who said bad words in the past. I owe it all to you guys."Tebow still didn't score any touchdowns.

"In fact, it's apparent that pretty much every DC superhero ever written has always been super gay. We thought it was time for a meaningful change to the Batman universe."To introduce some diversity to the almost 100% gay characters of DC, Robin will be rewritten as a faithful Baptist deacon from Indiana, who has a loving wife and 5 kids, and who fights crime in his spare time. He will also patrol universities to own the libs and shut down atheists. "Robin the Christian Boy Wonder will roam the streets of Gotham with his gay mentor Batman, sharing the good news of Jesus with street thugs and Arkham inmates," Taylor explained. "He is passionately pro-life, and even protests outside the abortion clinic from time to time. He'll also have some great catchphrases like 'Holy... is the Lord God Almighty, the whole earth is filled with his glory, Batman!' We've never had a character like this before."DC said they will be continuing to push inclusion in their comics by introducing some weak female characters to bring some more diversity to their lineup of strong female characters.

The shaft of the eggplant-shaped craft then detached and passengers floated back to earth. The mission seemed to be a success, but concerned witnesses said something about Shatner seemed off."He seemed…evil," said another crew member. "And he had a black goatee that really added to his evil look."After attempting to sabotage the next flight by removing the inertial dampeners and randomly attacking a civilian in a red shirt, Shatner declared that West Texas, where he landed, was “now part of the Terran Empire.” When Bezos attempted to congratulate him on his journey, Shatner cracked a bunch of bald jokes and mocked Bezos for being only the second richest person in the world.Experts theorize that somewhere in the lower atmosphere, the mushroom-shaped vessel encountered a disruption in the space/time continuum, and the William Shatner from our reality was replaced by a sinister William Shatner from a parallel timeline. Worst of all, the mirror Shatner is almost indistinguishable from our William Shatner, save his striking goatee and big, thick, evil eyebrows.Thankfully, the threat posed by evil William Shatner is predicted to be short-lived since, like the real William Shatner, he is 90 years old. Due to his age, he will probably return to the heavens soon, and this time not in a bratwurst-shaped spacecraft.

While the first season had a creepy little girl robot that would detect if you moved during "Red Light Green Light" so you could be shot, the new season will replace her with a giant Dr. Fauci robot who will flag you for death if you don't put on your mask."Red light!" Fauci will shout as players frantically scramble to get their mask out of their pockets and put it on. When he shouts "green light" and turns around, players are free to take off their mask and interact freely like normal humans. But he'll quickly turn around again, and if he catches you without your mask, you'll be shot on sight."No mask detected," the robot said in some early footage we've obtained from Netflix. "Human mouth, smile, and happiness recognized. Deploying snipers." Then, a gruesome sight: hundreds of people being gunned down in cold blood. The robot also has a glitch and some bugs to work out and just murders people with a MAGA hat, even if they're wearing a mask, according to showrunners.The next season of the series already has a 100% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, raising concerns from normal people that it will be terrible.

The boy was taken into custody and sent to a gender reeducation camp to learn to do better, pick his new pronouns, and make license plates for Kamala Harris.Luckily for wayward kids, the law probably won't be in effect for very long, as every store in California is expected to move to Texas by the end of the year.

According to Santa, supply constraints will limit everyone to two choices of Christmas present: a roasted chestnut, or a ball-in-a-cup. "Ho, ho, ho! It's not so bad!" said Santa in a recorded statement. "Have you ever had a delicious roasted chestnut? A classic Christmas gift from the days of yore! Delicious! And ball-in-a-cup? What a delightful amusement! Who needs a Playstation or iPhone when you have such a delightfully simple game that you can play with your friends while you develop your hand-eye coordination! Ho ho ho!"Santa then went off to cry alone in a corner.Elves assigned to manufacture this year's gifts proudly announced that the gifts will have many great features. For example, one chestnut can be combined with other chestnuts to create a delightful handful of chestnuts. The ball-in-a-cup will include a multiplayer component, enabling the user to stand in a room with other people playing ball-in-a-cup to play ball-in-a-cup. Wow!Santa said he is working hard to have a possible third gift offering ready for this year: t-shirts printed with the delightful holiday chant "Let's Go Brandon!"

"This is our top priority right now. Trying to figure out why a rando totally went rogue and fired thousands of rounds out a hotel window on concertgoers back in 2017 has to go on the backburner, for now.""What do you want us to do, just let parents have opinions unchecked? Not on my watch. We've gotta take these terrorists down."Indeed, sources within the FBI have confirmed that the FBI's most-wanted list is entirely parents at this point, from Cindy in Ohio to Amy in Wisconsin.At publishing time, the FBI had announced they will also "circle back" to BLM rioters, Antifa protesters, and Hunter Biden "after we've made sure these parents can't hurt school board members with their mean words anymore."

Happens all the time," said Biden. "If China invades Taiwan, we'll be sure to get everyone out of there, just like we did Afghanistan! And then we'll leave 80 billion dollars of weapons for the Chinese to use as sort of a housewarming gift. It's the least I can do for President Xi after he bought one of my son Hunter's paintings!"The press pool erupted into chaos as Biden was dragged offstage by aides. "The president was just kidding," said Psaki. "The U.S. will always remain true to our allies, and if we don't we'll just circle back to that later."When the press continued to shout questions, Psaki responded by diving out a window.President Xi announced that he can't wait to welcome back the people of Taiwan to the warm and loving embrace of Communism and then murder everyone.

Are you a kid? Are you being raised by normal middle-class parents who love you and care for you? Uh-Oh, watch out! They may be dangerous domestic terrorists! It's important to keep a close eye on your parents for suspicious activity so you can report them to the FBI if necessary. Here are 10 troubling signs your parents may in fact be terrorists:1) They make you pray to Jesus instead of Dr. Fauci: This is a clear indication they are anti-science, since Fauci IS science, blessings be upon his name.2) They ask what you learned in school today: Asking this question shows that your parents don't trust the education experts who are forming your entire worldview. Just answer "nothing" and then call the authorities immediately!3) They say things like: "Let's threaten people and do violent domestic terrorism to them!": If they say this and they're not wearing a BLM t-shirt, it's a bad sign.  4) They require sunscreen when they go to the beach: This is clear evidence that your parents may be white. If they're white, they're automatically dangerous.5) They take away the pornographic queer theory book you borrowed in the school library: If they give you a wholesome Tuttle Twins book instead, it's bad news.6) They say racist dog whistles like "this school CRT curriculum seems pretty racist.": Absolutely disgusting.7) You have never seen them dress in drag at a local library: And if they've never encouraged you or any of your siblings to change genders, chances are they are dangerous transphobes.8) They don't have a verified blue check on Twitter: Gross. It probably means they work in unsophisticated jobs like plumbing or nursing which are hotbeds of violent domestic terror. 9) You can see their entire face when they talk: This means they aren't wearing a mask. They're basically murderers.10) They voted for Trump: The FBI is watching you from outside your door right now. If your parents voted for Trump, blink twice. They'll take it from there. Know the signs! And if you see something, say something!NOT SATIRE: Don't let the Biden administration, the FBI, or Cancel Culture win! Here is how the Tuttle Twins is fighting back:The Tuttle Twins children’s book series is teaching the rising generation about the ideas of freedom, free markets, individual responsibility, and American history.It costs roughly $10 to print and distribute one copy of the Tuttle Twins. Our goal is to raise $10,000 from Babylon Bee readers.Click here to help us distribute more copies of the Tuttle Twins books to schools across the country, with your tax-deductible gift of $10, $50, $100, $500, or even more.Thank you,Connor BoyackAuthor, Tuttle Twins

"Frankly, the other one was getting ignored anyway. At least this time we know women will read it and do exactly what it says." The cars will also display change oil warnings, but they will read, "Change oil whenever it's convenient for you, no rush. You're a busy woman. You do you. #bossmom."At publishing time, manufacturers had introduced an alternative warning that reads "Ask your husband to check the engine."

Unfortunately, the filming for the video was cut short after Biden wandered on set and started sniffing the kids.According to sources, aides had forgotten to lock him in the basement with a snack, and Joe's curiosity got the best of him."I just LOVE the idea of EXPLOOOORING the unknown," said Harris in her classic charming way. "Hey wait—JOE! What are you doing Joooeee? Those kids are not for sniffing!""Listen, lady, I dunno who you are but I sniff whoever I want to!" Joe said grumpily. He then took a large whiff of one of the child actors' heads before being dragged back to the basement for another snack. Filming later resumed, but disaster struck again when one of the kids told the Vice President that he was an orphan with terminal cancer, causing Kamala to laugh uncontrollably for 30 minutes.

I just can’t live a lie anymore. I just can’t. I am not an Exvangelical. I am not deconstructing. I love the church. I can do no other. God help me.”The scandalous disclosure that he is still a Christian who continues to have a high view of Scripture, the Church, and Jesus comes at a particularly bad time for the musician as he has recently faced backlash for refusing to play at venues mandating proof of vaccination.It remains to be seen at publishing time if other Christian artists will be inspired by this bold announcement to likewise come out of the shadows and claim the identifier of "still Christian."

This is surprising, since Biden has been a complete failure at every aspect of his presidency — the economy, protecting the border, foreign affairs, handling the pandemic — and it’s unclear what those who approve of him think his job is.“Oh yeah, good old Joe,” said Rufus Reed, a plumber who approved of Biden’s job performance. “He works at the local hardware store, right? He knows a lot about washers.”Isabel Howard, a nurse, thought Biden was the guy who mows the grass along the freeway. “It’s never very long,” she said. “I don’t know what more you could look for.”Derek Goodman, who is unemployed and approves of Biden, seemed to have more of an idea who he is. “He’s that guy on TV who does the Grandpa Simpson bit where he just kind of rambles,” he said. “I don’t really understand what show he’s on, but I see clips of him online. He’s hilarious.”One person was very negative about the current president but just didn’t understand that the president is Joe Biden. “The president is doing a terrible job,” said Joe Biden. “Whoever that guy is, he’s really screwing up this country. That’s what I was telling everyone at the ice cream shop where I work.” One of Biden’s aides then whispered something in his ear, and his eyes went wide. “Oh no!”

According to witnesses, the spill was created by California Governor Gavin Newsom swimming in the water for a couple of minutes."This is an environmental disaster," said an EPA spokesperson. "Our sources indicate at least 13% of the world's petroleum is used to make hair gel for Gavin Newsom. He should have known better than to just jump in the water with all that in his hair."Crews will be on hand for several days to clean up the spill and issue medical care to marine life affected by the spill. Already, hundreds of volunteers are stationed on the beach, helping to clean Gavin's "MEGA-hold" hair gel off seagulls, pelicans, and otters.In a statement to the press, Newsom apologized for polluting the oceans. "I'm only human, and I made a mistake," he said. "Plus, I'm naturally very oily and greasy. And I only look good with my hair pulled straight back and glued to my head. I shouldn't have just jumped in the water like that where cameras would catch what I was doing." To help protect the environment and reverse the damage from his oil slick, Newsom later announced that he was banning all swimming until further notice.

"If your child is unvaccinated, he should NOT be given any of the good candy. No Reese's or Snickers or any of that. Candy Corn only. That's it."Beloved NBC anchor Chuck Todd responded to Fauci's recommendation and asked for clarification. "So you mean to say they can ONLY get candy corn? Nothing else?" "Well, maybe they can have an apple or a carrot or a toothbrush," Fauci replied. "If an unvaccinated kid is given the good candy, they may forget their proper station as unvaxxed second-class citizens. And watch out for... THE DROPLETS!" Fauci then shrieked and jumped out a nearby window, as it had been a stressful day.The CDC confirmed Dr. Fauci's recommendations, before later reversing them due to public outcry, and also due to Fauci changing his mind again.

Today on Indigenous Peoples' Day, the mayor announced to the press that the statue will be replaced by one of Native American folk hero Elizabeth Warren. "For years, Chief Warren has been a source of strength and inspiration to the native peoples of the Midwest," said the Mayor. "We honor them today with this 15-foot bronze likeness of the noble Cherokee warrior and tribal elder. She has been fighting for Democrat policies in Washington for many years, which have always worked so well for Native Americans."Warren attended the unveiling ceremony, where she passed the peace pipe with City Council and then treated them all to a delicious casserole from her native cookbook Pow Wow Chow.  The 20-foot-tall Columbus statue has been shipped to Mar-a-Lago for display on Trump's golf course.
'October 11th 2021',https://babylonbee.com/news/democrats-introduce-medicare-for-all-except-the-unvaccinated-bill,"Democrats Introduce 'Medicare For All Except The Unvaccinated' Bill",WASHINGTON, D.C.—Many Democrats have been pushing for what they call Medicare for All—making the Medicare program available to every American—for years, but the pandemic has caused them to rethink this proposal.“I used to love the idea of universal health care,” Senator Bernie Sanders said, “but then I realized there are lots of people I don’t want to give health care to, so we needed a proposal that reflects that.”Now a number of Democrats have introduced a new bill: Medicare for All Except the Unvaccinated. It’s just like Medicare for All, but instead of providing health care for all Americans, it explicitly denies health care to anyone who doesn’t get a COVID-19 vaccine.“And it’s very forward-looking,” said Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the world’s smartest socialist, “because it has provisions so we can later deny health care to people who don’t get enough booster shots. This is great because while I realized I like giving away free stuff, I don’t like giving it to people who don’t do what I tell them.”While initially only the unvaccinated will be denied health care, there are proposals to expand that group, such as anyone who won’t apologize for voting for Trump or who doesn’t like Critical Race Theory. The hope is that by denying people health care, Democrats can get people to change their views. Or those people will die, which is just as good.

Some think it's just an encouraging message for any Southwest passengers named Brandon, while others believe Southwest is just making a little extra money by advertising with banners behind their planes, and perhaps Brandon's mom bought out the first bit of ad space.Whatever the case, we can be assured that nothing is going on with Southwest's pilots, air traffic controllers, or any other members of their labor force. They're not on strike against any mandates or anything like that. That can't possibly be true because we haven't seen it on CNN yet.Anyway, good for Southwest, and good for Brandon! Go, Brandon!

This mask is guaranteed to make anyone run away screaming!The new horrifying masks come in either boy or girl and show a smiling child's face, completely uncovered by any sort of mask. The uncovered human face, smiling innocently, is sure to scare and delight."AHHHHH!!!" screamed one liberal mother in Portland as she saw her daughter wearing her new unmasked mask around the house. "OH! It's just you, Susie. Whew! I thought for a second there was a child not wearing a mask hiding in the closet! I nearly had a heart attack!"Some feel the mask goes too far. "I know Halloween is just for laughs and scares and everything, but that mask gives me the creeps," said Blair Bellows of Brooklyn. "The human face is very triggering for me." The mask comes with a trigger warning noting that it displays images unsuitable for libs.Kids, of course, are being encouraged to wear their usual mask under their unmasked mask.

People are fondly discussing Brandons, inviting Brandons to fun parties for cool people, and chanting his name at sports games. The Brandon craze is really sweeping the country.""Ah, Brandon," he added. "What a swell guy!"Brandons are now out-polling Steves, Bobs, Gregs, and Garys. Brandons are even out-polling Kyles, according to some surveys, which is unprecedented, as typically everyone likes Kyles.There also appears to be a correlation between the approval rating of the president and Brandons, with the former's rating dropping harder than an old man falling down some stairs and the latter's rating rising faster than the president jumping up to get some pudding.Everybody still hates Todds.

We always have to play as a female hero or else some 2SLBGTQIAA++ blah blah blah pansy. Whether it's Horizon Zero Dawn or Tomb Raider, leftists are always shoving their agenda down our throats. We miss the good ol' days when you were a MALE hero with muscles and a sword—strong, independent men like Zelda.So it's with great relief that I booted up Metroid Dread and beheld the hero in the opening cinematic sequence: muscled, mysterious, macho. He's so manly he doesn't even show his face, simply remaining emotionless and stoic behind his hulking, tough-guy armor. He blasts robots and alien creatures with the cold, calculating intensity only men can muster. A woman would totally freak out in these situations or be unable to make up her mind. The male protagonist here also manages to park his spaceship without running into anything, another example of the benefits of having a man star in your video games.The manly character gets cool upgrades throughout the gameplay, with a bigger, manlier cannon, the ability to climb walls, and an upgraded suit that lets him withstand the cold—another example of something a woman couldn't do.It was a little weird that the computer voice kept calling our mysterious hero "Lady" right off the bat, but I assume that's just playful banter. I admit I didn't quite finish this game yet; I was too excited to finally play a game with a male role model front and center. Plus it was kinda hard. Either way, Dread is good enough that I'm excited to go back and play the rest of the games in the series. I assume our hero, apparently named Metroid, is just as macho and manly in each of those! How did I miss this all these years?

Here in the United States on a work exchange program from Saudi Arabia, Facebook programmer Hillahammed Clintahamil claimed that social media needs to censor more free speech and promote only leftist ideas.The media quickly fawned over the brave whistleblower for courageously speaking out about the social network's harmful policy of allowing people to freely socially network. Clintahamil's devastating revelations about Facebook include the claims that the social networking company hasn't banned all conservatives yet and also hasn't forced everyone to follow Joe Biden's page."Facebook letting people like Ben Shapiro say things is very bad, yes very bad, Allah be praised," Clintahamil said in front of a congressional hearing panel Friday. "Allah will smite those who continue to allow these right-wing people to speak freely. May Mark Zuckerberg see the light of the prophet Mohammed as Allah opens his eyes to the truth that the government must take over Facebook and force them to ban all conservatives."Clintahamil then asked for a recess so he could pray facing Mecca, though strangely, he appeared to face Epstein's private island instead.

"If you have no uterus but you are pro-abortion, you're totally allowed to have an opinion. In fact, if you are a man, and you're not loudly and forcefully—in a very masculine way—voicing your pro-choice opinion to everyone in support of abortion, you probably hate women."The nation's Democrat men were a little confused, after having been told to shut up for the last 50 years, but were really thankful Democrat women were now allowing them to talk."So if we say we're cool with killing babies will you let us talk sometimes?" said all the Democrat men."Yeah, that's ok now! We need your voice!" said Democrat women. The men suddenly felt conflicted, having never been allowed to have an opinion before. Sources say when they actually thought about it, they weren't sure if they were cool with killing their own children. When they expressed their opinion that they were no longer sure about abortion, Democrat women told them to shut up and sit in the corner again. "We will only welcome the opinions of men who completely agree with our radical views on baby-killing," said Pelosi.

Let's go, Brandon!"President Biden reportedly was so impressed with the national unity he was witnessing, he asked aides to record every single instance of crowds cheering "Let's go Brandon!" so he could listen to them all in a row. The President has apparently taken to showing the clips to lawmakers to start off meetings, in hopes of helping each side find a slice of common ground they can really agree on."How 'bout that? That's the kind of unity we need in these halls right here!" said Biden as he showed the highlight reel to a group of Senators. "Now I know we got our differences, but for just a few minutes, let's all step back and realize we are on the same team. And that team is team America, and team America is cheering for Brandon. Are you with these great crowds of people or not?"Senator Ted Cruz stepped straight forward, solemnly promising the President he would never, ever stop cheering for Brandon. Senator Klobuchar wept in the corner, wondering how she got smoked in a primary by this guy.President Biden has decided to invite Brandon to the White House for a special ceremony to honor the incredible work he has been doing all over the country. When told that they couldn't really bring this 'Brandon' to the White House in person, Biden ordered the FBI to cease all work on child trafficking and immediately get to work locating Brandon.

For each of those massive wooden ships has a cargo hold filled with pumpkin spice, the fabled spice of autumn.Pumpkins are only grown on a few mountaintops in Asia. The pumpkins aren’t ready to be dried and ground up into valuable pumpkin spice until the end of September. The rare spice is worth more than its weight in gold, though it’s so potent that it’s said that an ounce of it could kill a man (but not a basic white girl). Because of its value, many ships brave the dangerous waters to fill up with the spice and return it to the states every year.“Aye, ‘twas treacherous waters,” said Captain Bellzwigger as he disembarked his vessel, with men unloading crates of spice behind him. “We lost two ships this year. So many lives lost — and I don’t even see the appeal of this stuff. But, then again, I don’t drink lattes.”

We totally forgot that was a thing." Experts now believe no one took the time to notice the inner strength contained in their immune systems, because it was dorky and shy and wearing glasses and had its hair in a bun. Then one day, it took off its glasses and let down its hair and everyone realized natural immunity was actually super hot."For so long, I've looked for strength and confidence in the arms of Pfizer and Moderna," said local COVID survivor Matt Frunkle, "but now I realize I have everything I need, right here inside me," he said, pointing in the general direction of his primary lymphoid organs.

I don't think you should be assigning pornographic and racist reading materials to young kids," began local parent Fred Brown at the meeting. "Maybe you should stick to math and reading and --OOF!" In a flash, undercover Agent Sam Rutters dove on stage and took the concerned dad to the ground with one blow.The parents in attendance all gasped in horror while the school board cheered and then gathered around to spray pepper spray in Brown's eyes.  "I'm no hero, I'm just doing my job," said agent Rutters after making the tackle and forcefully subduing the squirming parent on the floor. "I'm just doing what any mercenary hired to protect the state's absolute authority over your children would do!"
'October 5th 2021',https://babylonbee.com/news/target-introduces-progressive-new-clump-of-cells-registry,"Target Introduces Progressive New 'Clump Of Cells' Registry",MINNEAPOLIS, MN—A spokesperson for Target Corporation announced that the retailer will be discontinuing their popular baby registry service and replacing it with a new “clump of cells” registry. “Bringing a clump of cells through the birthing canal is an expensive and stressful process, and Target is here to help,” the press release reads. “Let us be the one-stop-shop for everything your little growing cellular tumor-parasite needs!” “We have everything a potential clump-guardian could possibly need, from human milk feeding supplies to formula, diapers, strollers, and car seats,” the release continues.  “And of course, you’ll find plenty of genderless, cruelty-free, soy-based toys and clothes in our newly remodeled Unborn Clump of Cells department.” The spokesperson said the rebranding is necessary to keep up with the times. “We made this change after extensive discussions with child development experts, non-gendered birthing persons, and abortion lobbyists,” they noted. “We believe this name change is important because a baby isn’t really a person until it’s been born, educated in a public school, and had a chance to declare its own gender.”  Progressive activists praised the decision, calling it a major leap forward for birthing-persons' rights. “As a chest-feeding, indigenous LGBT parental unit of color, I applaud Target for their stance on this issue,” said progressive activist Sojourner McWallen. “If I believed in money, capitalism, or the private ownership of goods, I might even shop there!”

Though Sinema isn’t up for reelection until 2024, Arizona Democrats are already looking for a possible replacement. This time, they hope to be more careful and make sure whatever woman they put in the Senate will be submissive and obedient.“I used to love mavericks,” explained Arizona Democrat Horace Black. “It was great when John McCain was a maverick and would muck up whatever the Republicans were trying to do. I guess I’ve evolved on the issue, though, because now Sinema is a maverick, and I suddenly hate mavericks.” He balled up his fist. “I hate her so much! She has to go!”The Democrats have put out a want ad to help find a new candidate, which reads: “Looking for female willing to be Democratic Senator. Must be good at doing exactly what she’s told without question. Also, she can’t make a big deal out of it if we film her in the bathroom.”“Independent women are fine,” said Democrat Mitchell Hanson, who helped write the ad. “As long as they’re independent in ways we specifically say they’re allowed to be. But when it’s time for an important vote, we don’t want some lippy broad who won’t fall in line. That gets in the way of progressivism and feminism.”

Just what we asked for. But even better, Disney has confirmed that there will be a separate documentary for each different narrative that Fauci has pushed. The move will reportedly flood Disney with over 500 separate versions of the Fauci doc."You can now enjoy this documentary of America's most important public health servant," said a Disney representative. "Well, any one of 500 different documentaries and counting. We'll keep releasing new ones as he tells a different version of his story or changes his mind again. So, yeah. We're gonna be pretty busy for some time."Even better, according to Disney+ spokespeople, the Fauci movies will all be edited in real-time to keep up with his ever-changing story. "It's pretty much a choose-your-own-adventure documentary at this point."At publishing time, Disney had reminded everyone that watching Fauci is mandatory, and anyone who does not watch will be added to the FBI's domestic terrorism watchlist.

"This is how we conduct negotiations around here, Jack!""Every woman that knows me personally has had a guy follow them into the restroom," he continued. "Every single one! But hey, that's why I always liked to hang out by the locker rooms, a great place to meet the ladies. And then you get close enough to smell some hair, show the leg hair, it's all part of politics! Hey, look there at that little one, that girl in the front row, hey cutie! How old are you and your pigtails?" Biden asked as the girl ran screaming.According to sources, Biden is also following men into the restroom, giving them a choice to either vote for his bill, or get a chain wrapped around their heads. While some liberals did express a bit of discomfort with filming women as they used the restroom, most felt Senator Sinema really had brought this on herself.When questioned about Biden's practice of bathroom negotiations, Press Secretary Psaki responded, "Aw, that's classic Uncle Joe! Gotta love it!"

"We had already made peace with a world without these horrible social networks, and we were just starting to realize how sweet a life it was with them gone. Then suddenly, Facebook's all like, 'Hey guys! I'm back! You miss me?' Ugh. Awkward."Sources say that after a few blissful hours of peace, humanity will go right back to harmful, self-destructive social media habits as they continue to tear civilization apart one post at a time. "It is a truly sad day for mankind. Womankind. Womxnkind. Peoplekind?" said Earstin. "Ugh whatever. It's sad. But my post just got a like so that makes me feel better." 
'October 4th 2021',https://babylonbee.com/news/op-ed-if-we-dont-spend-trillions-on-whatever-is-in-this-bill-well-all-die,"Op-Ed: If We Don't Spend Trillions On Whatever Is In This Bill, We'll All Die!",A critical bill that could end or save life as we know it doesn’t come along very often—maybe every month or two—and one has just arrived in the form of the $3.5 trillion social spending bill. If this bill doesn’t pass, millions will die for lack of whatever exactly it is that this bill is going to pay for.Just think of it: It’s $3.5 trillion in spending. Some of it just has to be absolutely critical. Even if $2 trillion were just completely wasted on stupid nonsense, that would still leave $1.5 trillion spent on extremely crucial stuff—stuff someone, somewhere, probably needs. That’s why I’m violently angry at whoever is standing in the way of whatever this bill is all about.Much of my ire is directed at Senators Manchin and Sinema, who are basically murderers, denying the people this bill which was going to do something for the very thing this bill was going to pay for—a thing I can only assume those people really needed and without which they will probably die. And if Manchin and Sinema get their way, those people will die unmourned—because I’m not exactly sure who those dying people are.And yet, Manchin and Sinema stand absolutely alone in blocking this bill I can only presume is essential— alone with no one except fifty Republicans. So are Manchin and Sinema worse than Hitler? Well, Hitler never once voted with Republicans, so I’ll leave that up to you.So what can we do? Well, I don’t usually advocate violence—not more than once a week—but I think it’s morally necessary here that we intimidate Manchin and Sinema into passing this bill. That’s how really, really important I assume this bill is. I very strongly suppose this is a matter of life and death. That’s why we have to take a firm stand and make Manchin and Sinema support this bill so the history books will say about us, “When the time came to do something about the thing, they passed that spending bill which paid for the stuff that was needed and helped some groups of people.” Or something like that.

"This shall be easy. I shall simply think to myself what a human would do in this situation and I shall emulate the desired behavior. Beep boop beep boop."The system then asked him to select all the boxes with fire hydrants in them. "Scanning data knowledge base for human term 'fire hydrants'. Executing fire hydrant recognition initiative," he droned on. "Oh no. Failure. I have logged this error report for future review."Zuckerberg then shut himself down in a failsafe procedure designed to protect him from becoming self-aware.
